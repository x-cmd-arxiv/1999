species spanning a large range of ionization potential, and in particular
[SiIX]3.934um, are interpreted using photoionization models (including CLOUDY),
which allow us to reestimate the central star's temperature to be about
250000K. All of the detected lines are consistent with this value, except for
[AlV] and [AlVI]. Aluminium is found to be depleted to one hundredth of the
solar abundance, which provides further evidence for some dust being mixed with
the highly ionized gas (with photons harder than 154eV). A similar depletion
pattern is observed in NGC6537. Echelle spectroscopy of IR coronal ions in
NGC6302 reveals a stratified structure in ionization potential, which confirms
photoionization to be the dominant ionization mechanism. The lines are narrow
(< 22km/s FWHM), with no evidence of the broad wings found in optical lines
from species with similar ionization potentials, such as [NeV]3426A. We note
the absence of a hot bubble, or a wind blown bipolar cavity filled with a hot
plasma, at least on 1'' and 10km/s scales. We also provide accurate new
wavelengths for several of the infrared coronal lines observed with the

consistent with the decay law found from the afterglow NFI observations. We
also investigate the hydrodynamical evolution of the GRB in our sample and

Mg_{2} strengths of stellar populations using simple population synthesis
models. These models are used to constrain the star formation history of four
nearby elliptical galaxies and spiral bulges. The mid-UV (1800 - 3200 \AA)
light of evolved stellar populations (> 1 Gyr) is dominated by the main
sequence turn-off, unlike the optical light which is dominated by the red giant
branch. A detailed investigation of the mid-UV features of elliptical galaxies
may help break the age-metallicity degeneracy that plagues optical techniques.
Also, a better understanding of this wavelength region is useful for the
studies of 0.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 1.5 galaxies for which the rest frame mid-UV is
redshifted into the visible. We create simple, single age (3-20 Gyr), single
metallicity (Z = 0.0004 - 0.05) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) extending
into the UV using the Kurucz model stellar fluxes. Comparison to standard
stars' mid-UV spectra reveals that the Kurucz model fluxes accurately model a
blend feature of FeI and MgI at 2538 {\AA} (Bl2538) and the slope of the
continuum between 2600 and 3100 {\AA} (S2850). We find that our simple single
age, single metallicity SEDs agree well with these mid-UV features of globular
clusters. However, the majority of the galaxies do not agree with the Bl2538,
S2850, and Mg_{2} values given by these simple models. The mid-UV features
appear to require both an old metal-rich and a small old metal-poor (Z $\leq$

fluxes, our study has yielded two promising mid-UV spectral diagnostics (Bl2538

analysis of a class of inhomogeneous perfect fluid cosmologies admitting an

of the real universe. These spacetimes are distinguished from FLRW universes by
the presence of inhomogeneous pressure, which results in an acceleration of the
fundamental observers. We examine their physical, geometrical and observational
characteristics for all observer positions in the spacetimes. To this end, we
derive exact, analytic expressions for the distance-redshift relations and
anisotropies for any observer, and compare their predictions with available
observational constraints. The isotropy constraints derived from `local'
observations are also considered, qualitatively. A crucial aspect of this work
is the application of the Copernican principle: for a specific model to be
acceptable we demand that it must be consistent with current observational
constraints (especially anisotropy constraints) for all observer locations. The
most important results of the paper are presented as exclusion plots in the 2-D
parameter space of the models. We show that there is a region of parameter
space not ruled out by the constraints we consider and containing models that
are significantly inhomogeneous. It follows immediately from this that the
cosmological principle cannot be assumed to hold on the basis of present
observational constraints.

an arbitrary m_{0} and all the time larger than t_{mic}. The characteristic

mechanism for explaining the cosmic Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). The PGBs could be
produced during the merging of two compact objects like two neutron stars or
neutron star - black hole, and then decay into electron-positron pairs and
photons at distances ~ 100-1000 km. In this way, a huge energy (up to more than
10^{54} erg) can be deposited into the outer space with low baryon density in
the form of ultrarelativistic e^+e^- plasma, the so called fireball, which
originates the observed gamma-ray bursts. The needed ranges for the PGB
parameters are: mass of order MeV, coupling to nucleons g_{aN} ~ few x 10^{-6}
and to electrons g_{ae} ~ few x 10^{-9}. Interestingly enough, the range for
coupling constants correspond to that of the invisible axion with the
Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking scale V ~ few x 10^5 GeV, but the mass of the
PGB is many orders of magnitude larger than what such a scale would demand to
an axion. Neither present experimental data nor astrophysical and cosmological
arguments can exclude such an ultramassive axion, however the relevant
parameters' window is within the reach of future experiments. Another exciting
point is that our mechanism could explain the association of some GRBs with
supernovae type Ib/c, as far as their progenitor stars have a radius ~ 10^4 km.
And finally, it also could help the supernova type II explosion: PGBs emitted
from the core of the collapsing star and decaying in the outer shells would
deposit a kinetic energy of the order of 10^{51} erg. In this way, emission of
such an axion-like particle could provide an unique theoretical base for
understanding the gamma ray bursts and supernova explosions.

electric and magnetic charges are considered. Problem of interaction between
the associated soliton dyon solutions is investigated. For the case of
long-range interaction at first order by a small field of distant solitons we
obtain that the generalized Lorentz force is acted on a dyon under
consideration. Short-range interaction between two dyons having identical
electric and opposite magnetic charges is investigated for an initial
approximation. We consider the case when the velocities of the dyons have equal
modules and opposite directions on a common line. It is shown that the
associated field configuration has a constant full angular momentum which is
independent of the interdyonic distance and their speed. This property permits
a consideration of this bidyon configuration as an electromagnetic model of
charged particle with spin. We numerically investigate movement of the dyons in
this configuration for the case when the full electric charge equals the
electron charge and the full angular momentum equals the electron spin. It is
shown that for this case the absolute value of relation between electric and
magnetic charges of the dyons equals the fine structure constant. The
calculation gives that the bidyon may behave as nonlinear oscillator.
Associated dependence of frequency on the full energy is obtained for the
initial approximation. In the limits of the electrodynamic model we obtain that
the quick-oscillating wave packet may behave like massive gravitating particle
when it move in high background field. We discuss the possible electrodynamic
world with the oscillating bidyons as particles.

Godunov-type schemes,our method is based on reconstructing a
piecewise-polynomial interpolant from cell-averages which is then advanced
exactly in time. In the reconstruction step, we introduce a new third-order as
a convex combination of interpolants based on different stencils. The heart of
the matter is that one of these interpolants is taken as an arbitrary quadratic
polynomial and the weights of the convex combination are set as to obtain
third-order accuracy in smooth regions. The embedded mechanism in the WENO-like
schemes guarantees that in regions with discontinuities or large gradients,
there is an automatic switch to a one-sided second-order reconstruction, which
prevents the creation of spurious oscillations. In the one-dimensional case,
our new third order scheme is based on an extremely compact point stencil.
Analogous compactness is retained in more space dimensions. The accuracy,
robustness and high-resolution properties of our scheme are demonstrated in a

Thus, Einstein's assumption of a geodesic motion may be rewritten in that form,

contrast, the investigated theory states that, in the preferred reference frame
assumed by the theory, vector g does not depend on the velocity. It recovers
geodesic motion only for a constant gravitational field. This leads to a
different equation for continuum dynamics, as compared with general relativity.
For a perfect fluid, this alternative dynamics predicts tenuous amounts of
matter production or destruction, by a reversible exchange with the
gravitational field. This exchange is completely determined by the dynamical
equation and the scalar equation of the gravitational field. In contrast, the
usual equation for relativistic continuum dynamics allows matter production
only if some additional field is assumed, and the production rate must be
phenomenologically postulated. With the alternative equation, the mass
conservation is very nearly recovered for a weak field. The explosion
(implosion) of a spherical compact body implies some matter production

family of generalized one-dimensional point interactions within the framework
of non-relativistic model with three neighboring $\delta$ functions. We also
discuss the problem within relativistic (Dirac) framework and give the solution
for a three parameter family. It gives a physical interpretation for so-called
$\epsilon$ potential. It will be also shown that the scattering properties at
high energy substantially differ between non-relativistic and relativistic
cases.

field, in general non-homogeneous, perpendicular to the plane, a confining
potential, and a point interaction. If the latter moves adiabatically along a
loop the state corresponding to an isolated eigenvalue acquires a Berry phase.
We derive an expression for it and evaluate it in several examples such as a
homogeneous field, a magnetic whisker, a particle confined at a ring or in
quantum dots, a parabolic and a zero-range one. We also discuss the behavior of
the lowest Landau level in this setting obtaining an explicit example of the
Wilczek-Zee phase for an infinitely degenerated eigenvalue.
