  Flynn",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The properties of dust in giant elliptical galaxies are reviewed, with
particular emphasis on the influence of the environment.
  After normalizing by the optical luminosities, a strong anti-correlation
between the masses of dust and hot gas in X-ray bright ellipticals is found.
Furthermore, large-scale, regularly-shaped dust lanes (which are symmetric with
respect to the galaxy nucleus) are only found to be present in ellipticals with
the lowest ratios of the mass of hot gas to the blue luminosity M_hot/L_B <
0.04 in solar units. This can be explained by the short time scale for the
destruction of dust grains within hot gas compared to the formation timescale
of such dust lanes in early-type galaxies.
  Dust within ellipticals in ``loose'' environments (in the field or in loose
groups) is typically characterized by small values of R_V = A_V/E(B-V) (i.e.,
small characteristic grain sizes), and distributed in dust lanes with a smooth,
relaxed morphology. On the other hand, dust in ellipticals that are in or near
the center of dense groups or clusters is typically much more irregularly
distributed, and characterized by R_V values that are close to the Galactic
one.
  I predict that ellipticals containing ``relaxed'' dust lanes with typical
dust masses of 10E6 - 10E7 solar masses do not contain hot, X-ray-emitting gas.

$\approx 130h^{-1}Mpc$ at low redshifts. This peak in the power spectrum
provides a standard ruler in comoving space which can be used to compare the
local geometry at high and low redshifts, thereby constraining the curvature
parameters.
  It is shown here that this power spectrum peak is present in the observed
quasar distribution at $z\sim 2$: qualitatively, via wedge diagrams which
clearly show a void-like structure, and quantitatively, via one-dimensional
Fourier analysis of the quasars' tangential distribution. The sample studied
here contains 812 quasars.
  The method produces strong constraints (68% confidence limits) on the density
parameter $\Omega_0$ and weaker constraints on the cosmological constant
$\lambda_0$, which can be expressed by the relation $ \Omega_0 = (0.24 \pm0.15)
+ (0.10\pm0.08) \lambda_0 $. Independently of $\lambda_0$ (in the range
$\lambda_0 \in [0,1]$), the constraint is $0.1 < \Omega_0 < 0.45$.
  Combination of the present results with SN Type Ia results yields $\Omega_0 =
(0.30\pm0.11) + (0.57\pm0.11) (\lambda_0-0.7),$ $0.55 < \lambda_0 < 0.95,$ (68%

universe satisfies a nearly flat, perturbed
Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker model, independently of any cosmic

jets are found to have |RM| < 100 rad/m/m. Such sharp RM gradients cannot be
produced by cluster or galactic-scale magnetic fields, but rather must be the
result of magnetic fields organized over the central 1-100 pc. The RMs of the
sources studied to date and the polarization properties of BL Lacs, quasars and

schemes. The direct detection of high RMs in these quasar cores can explain the
low fractional core polarizations usually observed in quasars at centimeter
wavelengths as the result of irregularities in the Faraday screen on scales
smaller than the telescope beam. Variability in the RM of the core is reported
for 3C 279 between observations taken 1.5 years apart, indicating that the
Faraday screen changes on that timescale, or that the projected superluminal

edge-on disc galaxies are used to study the intrinsic vertical colour gradients

residual dust extinction and gradients in the galaxies' metal abundance. It
appears that the intrinsic vertical colour gradients are either non-existent,
or small and relatively constant as a function of position along the galaxies'
major axes. Our results are consistent with the absence of any vertical colour
gradient in the discs of the early-type sample galaxies. In most galaxies
small-scale variations in the magnitude and even the direction of the vertical
gradient are observed: at larger galactocentric distances they generally
display redder colours with increasing z height, whereas the opposite is often
observed in and near the galactic centres. For a significant fraction of our
sample galaxies another mechanism in addition to the effects of stellar
population gradients is required to explain the magnitude of the observed
gradients. The non-zero colour gradients in a significant fraction of our
sample galaxies are likely (at least) partially due to residual dust extinction
at these z heights, as is also evidenced from the sometimes significant
differences between the vertical colour gradients measured on either side of
the galactic planes. We suggest that initial vertical metallicity gradients, if
any, have likely not been accentuated by accretion or merging events over the
lifetimes of our sample galaxies. On the other hand, they may have weakened any
existing vertical metallicity gradients, although they also may have left the
existing correlations unchanged.

clues to understanding this unexpected lattice structure. A relativistic

structures, with comoving lengths larger than about 10 Mpc. Structures shorter
than this would have been destroyed by diffusion due to the small
pre-recombination conductivity. If filaments constitute a lattice, the

accreting from the interstellar medium are extremely rare, if observed at all,

distribution may peak at $\sim 200-400 {\rm km s}^{-1}$, as inferred from

may decay on timescales $\sim 10^8-10^9$ yr, preventing a large fraction of

the first time a discussion of the orbital evolution of cores with eccentricity

is given. We find that the direction of orbital migration reverses for
e>1.1H/r. This occurs as a result of the orbital crossing of resonances in the
disc that do not overlap the orbit when the eccentricity is very small. Simple
expressions giving approximate fits to the eccentricity damping rate and the

distribution is such that it is generally well confined within the gas disc. By
use of a three dimensional N-body code we simulate the evolution of a system of
protoplanetary cores, incorporating our eccentricity damping and migration
rates. Assuming that collisions lead to agglomeration, we find that the
vertical confinement of the protoplanet distribution permits cores to build up
from 0.1 to 1 earth mass in only ~10^4 yr, within 1au. The time-scale required
to achieve this is comparable to the migration time-scale. We deduce that it is
not possible to build up a massive enough core to form a gas giant planet
before orbital migration ultimately results in the preferential delivery of all
such bodies to the neighbourhood of the central star. [Abridged]

range of masses covering the so-called Red Giant Branch phase transition.
Taking as a guideline the observational constraints given by Hipparcos
parallaxes to the predicted luminosity of models originated from Red Giant
progenitors with He core undergoing electron degeneracy, we compare models by
various authors as recently appeared in the literature, disclosing sensitive
differences in the predicted luminosity. The solidity of these theoretical
predictions is investigated by exploring the effects of varying the assumptions
about the efficiency of core overshooting or the amount of mass loss, giving
quantitative estimates of the related uncertainties. However, one finds that
theoretical predictions concerning the luminosity of the red giant clump in the
Hipparcos sample is scarcely affected by these mechanisms.A comparison among
theoretical predictions as recently given by different authors convincingly
demonstrates that the different luminosity predictions are the natural results
of evolutionary codes with different - but all reasonable- input physics. In
this context observations suggests that stellar models based on the most
updated input physics are possibly overestimating the luminosity of these
structures, raising doubts on several current predictions concerning the
luminosity of HB stars in galactic globulars.

simulations of cluster formation indicate that galaxy clusters may contain
compact cores that are substantially smaller than the cores revealed by the
X-ray observations of hot intracluster gas. In this paper we present a model
that describes how two distinct cores can grow simultaneously as a result of
infall from the background dark matter. This model needs a pre-existing
localized large fluctuation, which can be the non-Gaussian density peak of the
primordial fluctuations, to seed the individual growing cluster. On the other
hand, numerous recent observations also show that no strong evolution is
detected for galaxy clusters within the redshift up to $z\sim 0.8$. We
therefore present a comparison of observations with the saturated cluster
configuration resulting from our infall model. In the saturated state, the
predicted compact core mass is about few$\times 10^{11} M_\odot$ and the core
size about 1 kpc for a cluster mass $\sim$ several $\times 10^{15} M_\odot$
within a radius of 3 Mpc. We have successfully reproduced the dark matter
distribution revealed by the gravitational lensing, and the observed radial
distributions of cluster galaxies, intracluster gas (i.e., the conventional
$\beta$ model) and baryon fractions in a consistent way. This model, when
combined with the observed X-ray surface brightness profiles of clusters,
predicts that the overall temperature of intracluster gas has a tendency of
radial decline with a mean polytropic index $\gamma\approx1.2$. Finally, the
so-called $\beta$ discrepancy finds a natural explanation for such a polytropic
gas in our model.

theory to magnetic states in finite dimension. The self-energy includes the
effect of spin fluctuations and screening of the Coulomb interaction due to
particle-particle scattering. At half-filling the quasiparticles reduce the
width of the Mott-Hubbard `gap' and have dispersions and spectral weights that
agree remarkably well with quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization
calculations. Away from half-filling we consider incommensurate magnetic order
with a varying local spin direction, and derive the photoemission and optical
spectra. The incommensurate magnetic order leads to a pseudogap which opens at
the Fermi energy and coexists with a large Mott-Hubbard gap. The quasiparticle
states survive in the doped systems, but their dispersion is modified with the
doping and a rigid band picture does not apply. Spectral weight in the optical
conductivity is transferred to lower energies and the Drude weight increases
linearly with increasing doping. We show that incommensurate magnetic order
leads also to mid-gap states in the optical spectra and to decreased scattering
rates in the transport processes, in qualitative agreement with the
experimental observations in doped systems. The gradual disappearence of the
spiral magnetic order and the vanishing pseudogap with increasing temperature
is found to be responsible for the linear resistivity. We discuss the possible
reasons why these results may only partially explain the features observed in
the optical spectra of high temperature superconductors.

context of supergravity. We distinguish two cases. One is when the messenger of
the supersymmetry breaking is a non Abelian gauge force and the other is when
the messenger is a pseudoanomalous U(1). We assume that these models originate
from string theory and we impose the constraint of the vanishing of the
cosmological constant requiring also the stabilization of the dilaton. In the
first case, we do not find vacua that are consistent with the constraints of
gauge mediation and have a zero tree level cosmological constant. In the second
case, no such conflict arises. In addition, by looking at the one loop
cosmological constant, we show that the dilaton F-term can not be neglected in
either case. For the gauge mediated case our considerations suggest that the
dilaton must be frozen out of the low energy field theory by non-perturbative
string dynamics.

  Theorem","Preliminary version, 78 pages, 8 figures",,,,"math.DG math-ph math.MP",,"  We prove the Riemannian Penrose conjecture, an important case of a conjecture
made by Roger Penrose in 1973, by defining a new flow of metrics. This flow of
metrics stays inside the class of asymptotically flat Riemannian 3-manifolds
with nonnegative scalar curvature which contain minimal spheres. In particular,
if we consider a Riemannian 3-manifold as a totally geodesic submanifold of a
space-time in the context of general relativity, then outermost minimal spheres
with total area $A$ correspond to apparent horizons of black holes contributing
a mass $\sqrt{A/16\pi}$, scalar curvature corresponds to local energy density
at each point, and the rate at which the metric becomes flat at infinity
corresponds to total mass. The Riemannian Penrose conjecture then states that
the total mass of an asymptotically flat 3-manifold with nonnegative scalar
curvature is greater than or equal to the mass contributed by the black holes.
  The flow of metrics we define continuously evolves the original 3-metric to a
Schwarzschild 3-metric, which represents a spherically symmetric black hole in
vacuum. We define the flow such that the area of the minimal spheres (which
flow outward) and hence the mass contributed by the black holes in each of the
metrics in the flow is constant, and then use the positive mass theorem to show
that the total mass of the metrics is nonincreasing. Then since the total mass
equals the mass of the black holes in a Schwarzschild metric, the Riemannian
Penrose conjecture follows.
  This result improves upon the beautiful work of Huisken and Ilmanen, who used
inverse mean curvature flows of surfaces to show that the total mass is at
least the mass contributed by the largest black hole.

algebras are Z_2-graded by construction. However, only a Z_n-gradation induced
by a choice of a basis, or even better, by a Chevalley vector space isomorphism
Cl(V) <-> \bigwedge V and an ordering, guarantees a multi-vector decomposition
into scalars, vectors, tensors, and so on, mandatory in physics. We show that
the Chevalley isomorphism theorem cannot be generalized to algebras if the
Z_n-grading or other structures are added, e.g., a linear form. We work with
pairs consisting of a Clifford algebra and a linear form or a Z_n-grading which
we now call 'Clifford algebras of multi-vectors' or 'quantum Clifford
algebras'. It turns out, that in this sense, all multi-vector Clifford algebras
of the same quadratic but different bilinear forms are non-isomorphic. The
usefulness of such algebras in quantum field theory and superconductivity was
shown elsewhere. Allowing for arbitrary bilinear forms however spoils their
diagonalizability which has a considerable effect on the tensor decomposition
of the Clifford algebras governed by the periodicity theorems, including the
Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro mod 8 periodicity. We consider real algebras Cl_{p,q} which
can be decomposed in the symmetric case into a tensor product Cl_{p-1,q-1}
\otimes Cl_{1,1}. The general case used in quantum field theory lacks this
feature. Theories with non-symmetric bilinear forms are however needed in the
analysis of multi-particle states in interacting theories. A connection to
q-deformed structures through nontrivial vacuum states in quantum theories is
outlined.

derivation of the kinetic equation describing the evolution of a simple quantum
system in interaction with a complex quantum system. A typical quantum complex
system is modeled by means of parametric banded random matrices coupled to the
subsystem of interest. We do not assume the weak coupling limit and allow for
an independent dynamics of the ``reservoir''. We discuss the reasons for having
a new theoretical approach and the new elements introduced by us. The present
approach incorporates known limits and previous results, but at the same time
includes new cases, previously never derived on a microscopic level. We briefly
discuss the kinetic equation and its solution for a particle in the absence of
an external field.
