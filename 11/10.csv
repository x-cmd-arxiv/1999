  Consciousness","26 pages, 12 figures","Journal of Consciousness Studies 9(8):3-29 (2002)",,,"adap-org nlin.AO",,"  Fundamental approaches bypass the problem of getting consciousness from
non-conscious components by positing that consciousness is a universal
primitive. For example, the double aspect theory of information holds that
information has a phenomenal aspect. How then do you get from phenomenal
information to human consciousness? This paper proposes that an entity is
conscious to the extent it amplifies information, first by trapping and
integrating it through closure, and second by maintaining dynamics at the edge
of chaos through simultaneous processes of divergence and convergence. The
origin of life through autocatalytic closure, and the origin of an
interconnected worldview through conceptual closure, induced phase transitions
in the degree to which information, and thus consciousness, is locally
amplified. Divergence and convergence of cognitive information may involve
phenomena observed in light e.g. focusing, interference, and resonance. By
making information flow inward-biased, closure shields us from external
consciousness; thus the paucity of consciousness may be an illusion.

metallicities and metallicity-sensitive colors are bimodal, with peaks at
[Fe/H] ~ -1.4 and -0.6. The distribution of V-I is often bimodal in elliptical
galaxies' globular cluster systems, but is not sensitive enough to metallicity
to show bimodality in M31 and Galactic cluster systems. The radial distribution
and kinematics of the two M31 metallicity groups imply that they are analogs of
the Galactic `halo' and `disk/bulge' cluster systems. The globular clusters in
M31 have a small radial metallicity gradient, suggesting that some dissipation
occurred during the GCS formation. The lack of correlation between cluster
luminosity and metallicity in M31 GCs shows that self-enrichment is not

dimensional relativistic hydrodynamic jets, which allow for a study of the
observational implications of the interaction between the jet and external
medium. This interaction gives rise to a stratification of the jet where a fast
spine is surrounded by a slow high energy shear layer. The stratification, and
in particular the large specific internal energy and slow flow in the shear
layer largely determines the emission from the jet. If the magnetic field in
the shear layer becomes helical (e.g., resulting from an initial toroidal field
and an aligned field component generated by shear) the emission shows a cross
section asymmetry, in which either the top or the bottom of the jet dominates
the emission. This, as well as limb or spine brightening, is a function of the
viewing angle and flow velocity, and the top/bottom jet emission predominance
can be reversed if the jet changes direction with respect to the observer, or
presents a change in velocity. The asymmetry is more prominent in the polarized
flux, because of field cancellation (or amplification) along the line of sight.
Recent observations of jet cross section emission asymmetries in the blazar

and motions are similar to what are commonly observed in weakly
self-gravitating interstellar clouds, suggesting that these clouds get their
fractal structures from non-linear magnetic waves generated in the intercloud
medium; no internal source of turbulent energy is necessary. The clumps in the
simulated clouds are slightly warmer than the interclump medium as a result of
magnetic dissipational and compressive heating. Thus the interclump medium has
a lower pressure than the clumps, demonstrating that the clumps owe their
existence to transient compressive motions, not pressure confinement. Clump
lifetimes increase with size, and are about one sound crossing time. Two
specific problems are addressed. We find that low ionization fractions in
molecular clouds do not necessarily lead to increased cloud smoothing, but that
enhanced density in a self-gravitating cloud does, because of external wave
self-shielding. Bulk cloud self-gravity may therefore promote star formation in
the relatively quiescent gas pools that contain a thermal Jeans mass or more.

outer Lindblad resonance (OLR) of the Galactic bar lies in the vicinity of the
Sun. How does this resonance affect the distribution function in the outer
parts of a barred disk, and can we identify any effect of the resonance in the
velocity distribution f(v) actually observed in the solar neighborhood? To
answer these questions, detailed simulations of f(v) in the outer parts of an
exponential stellar disks with nearly flat rotation curves and a rotating
central bar have been performed. For a model resembling the old stellar disk,
the OLR causes a distinct feature in f(v) over a significant fraction of the
outer disk. For positions <2kpc outside the OLR radius and at bar angles of
\~10-70 degrees, f(v) inhibits a bi-modality between the low-velocity stars
moving like the local standard of rest (LSR) and a secondary mode of stars
predominantly moving outward and rotating more slowly than the LSR.
  Such a bi-modality is indeed present in f(v) inferred from the Hipparcos data
for late-type stars in the solar neighborhood. If one interpretes this observed
bi-modality as induced by the OLR -- and there are hardly any viable
alternatives -- then one is forced to deduce that the OLR radius is slightly
smaller than Ro. Moreover, by a quantitative comparison of the observed with
the simulated distributions one finds that the pattern speed of the bar is
1.85+/-0.15 times the local circular frequency, where the error is dominated by
the uncertainty in bar angle and local circular speed.
  Also other, less prominent but still significant, features in the observed
f(v) resemble properties of the simulated velocity distributions, in particular
a ripple caused by orbits trapped in the outer 1:1 resonance.

supernova explosion, is the most promising candidate site for r-process

general relativistic effects play a significant role in increasing entropy and
decreasing dynamic time scale of the neutrino-driven wind. Exploring wide

interesting physical conditions which lead to successful r-process
nucleosynthesis. The conditions which we found realize in the neutrino-driven
wind with very short dynamic time scale $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 6$ ms and
relatively low entropy $S \sim 140$. We carry out the $\alpha$-process and

star formation process, a new-born star would rotate much faster than its
fission speed. This constitutes the angular momentum problem of new-born stars.
In this paper, the angular momentum transfer in the contraction of a rotating
magnetized cloud is studied with axisymmetric MHD simulations. Owing to the
large dynamic range covered by the nested-grid method, the structure of the
cloud in the range from 10 AU to 0.1 pc is explored. First, the cloud
experiences a run-away collapse, and a disk forms perpendicularly to the
magnetic field, in which the central density increases greatly in a finite
time-scale. In this phase, the specific angular momentum j of the disk
decreases to $\simeq 1/3$ of the initial cloud. After the central density of
the disk exceeds $\sim 10^{10}{\rm cm}^{-3}$, the infall on to the central
object develops. In this accretion stage, the rotation motion and thus the
toroidal magnetic field drive the outflow. The angular momentum of the central
object is transferred efficiently by the outflow as well as the effect of the
magnetic stress. In 7000 yr from the core formation, the specific angular
momentum of the central $0.17M_\odot$ decreases a factor of 10^{-4} from the
initial value (i.e. from $10^{20}{\rm cm^2 s^{-1}}$ to $10^{16}{\rm cm^2

which caught it at the highest (2-10) keV flux level observed so far. The LECS,
MECS and PDS data, extending over (0.1-100) keV, are used to investigate the
physical similarities and differences between LINERs and AGNs. The continuum is
well fitted by a power law of photon index \sim 1.84, modified by little
absorption due to cold material. Superimposed on the continuum BeppoSAX detects
a 6.7 keV emission line (confirming an ASCA result) and an absorption edge at
8.6 keV. Both spectral features are consistent with being produced by iron at
the same high ionization level, and probably also with the same column density.
So, we suggest that they originate from transmission through highly ionized
thin material. Concerning the origin of the continuum emission, we do not
observe signs of reflection from the optically thick material of an accretion
disk, as usually found in Seyfert 1's (a 6.4 keV emission line and a broad bump
peaking at 10-20 keV). The low bolometric luminosity of the nucleus of M81 is
consistent with being produced by advection dominated accretion; in this case
the X-ray emission should be dominated by Comptonization, rather than by
bremsstrahlung, in order to reproduce the steep spectrum observed over the

the L-configuration. Among the many scenarios put forward to explain the origin
of this chiral homogeneity (i.e., homochirality), one involves the asymmetric
photolysis of amino acids present in space, triggered by circularly polarized
UV radiation. The recent observation of circularly polarized light (CPL) in the
Orion OMC-1 star-forming region (Bailey et al. 1998, Science 281, 672) has been
presented as providing a strong validation of this scenario. The present paper
reviews the situation. It is stressed for example that one important condition
for the asymmetric photolysis by CPL to be at the origin of the terrestrial
homochirality of natural amino acids is generally overlooked, namely, the
asymmetric photolysis should favour the L-enantiomer for ALL the primordial
amino acids involved in the genesis of life (i.e., biogenic amino acids).
Although this condition is probably satisfied for aliphatic amino acids, some
non-aliphatic amino acids like tryptophan and proline may violate the condition
and thus invalidate the asymmetric photolysis scenario, assuming they were
among the primordial amino acids. Alternatively, if CPL photolysis in space is
indeed the source of homochirality of amino acids, then tryptophan and proline
may be crossed out from the list of biogenic amino acids.

this mode can extend considerably the leptoquark search for a large range of
these couplings. In fact, for Yukawa couplings of the electromagnetic strength,
the combined results of the Tevatron experiments can exclude the existence of
leptoquarks with masses up to 260--285 (370--425)
  GeV at the RUN I (RUN II), depending on their type.

some aspects of the thermal production of gravitinos, taking into account that
in fact reheating is not instantaneous and inflation is likely to be followed
by a prolonged stage of coherent oscillations of the inflaton field. We then
proceed by further investigating the non-thermal generation of gravitinos,
providing the necessary tools to study this process in a generic time-dependent

linearized Brans-Dicke (BD) gravity is recovered on either wall, with different
BD parameters. On the wall with positive tension the BD parameter is larger
than 3000 provided that the separation between walls is larger than 4 times the
AdS radius. For the wall of negative tension, the BD parameter is always
negative but greater than -3/2. In either case, shadow matter from the other
wall gravitates upon us. For equal Newtonian mass, light deflection from shadow
matter is 25 % weaker than from ordinary matter. Hence, the effective mass of a
clustered object containing shadow dark matter would be underestimated if
naively measured through its lensing effect. For the case of a single wall of
positive tension, Einstein gravity is recovered on the wall to leading order,
and if the source is stationary the field stays localized near the wall. We
calculate the leading Kaluza-Klein corrections to the linearized gravitational
field of a non-relativistic spherical object and find that the metric is
different from the Schwarzschild solution at large distances. We believe that
our linearized solution corresponds to the field far from the horizon after
gravitational collapse of matter on the brane.

C in a Calabi-Yau threefold Y to the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants in the
following cases.
  (1) If the curve C has one node and satisfies a certain genericity condition,
we prove that the contribution of multiple covers of degree d is given by the
sum of all 1/n^3 where n divides d.
  (2) For a smoothly embedded contractable curve C in Y we define schemes C_i
for i=1,...,l where C_i is supported on C and has multiplicity i, and the
integer l (0<l<7) is Kollar's invariant ``length''. We prove that the
contribution of multiple covers of C of degree d is given by the sum of
k_{d/n}/n^3 where n divides d and where k_i is the multiplicity of C_i in its
Hilbert scheme (and k_i=0 if i>l).
  In the latter case we also get a formula for arbitrary genus.
  These results show that the curve C contributes an integer amount to the
so-called instanton numbers that are defined recursively in terms of the
Gromov-Witten invariants and are conjectured to be integers.
