conjunction with several instances of non-thermal X-ray emission from supernova
remnants, has led to inferences of super-TeV electrons in these extended
sources. While this is sufficient to propel the theoretical community in their
modelling of particle acceleration and associated radiation, the anticipated
emergence in the next decade of a number of new experiments probing the TeV and
sub-TeV bands provides further substantial motivation for modellers. In
particular, the quest for obtaining unambiguous gamma-ray signatures of cosmic
ray ion acceleration defines a ``Holy Grail'' for observers and theorists
alike. This review summarizes theoretical developments in the prediction of
MeV-TeV gamma-rays from supernova remnants over the last five years, focusing
on how global properties of models can impact, and be impacted by, hard
gamma-ray observational programs, thereby probing the supernova remnant
environment. Properties of central consideration include the maximum energy of
accelerated particles, the density of the unshocked interstellar medium, the
ambient magnetic field, and the relativistic electron-to-proton ratio. Criteria
for determining good candidate remnants for observability in the TeV band are
identified.

  Workshop ed. B. L. Dingus (AIP, New York, 2000)",,"10.1063/1.1291373",,"astro-ph",,"  One of the principal results obtained by the EGRET experiment aboard the
Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) was the detection of several Gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) above 100 MeV. The broad-band spectra obtained for these bursts
gave no indication of any high energy spectral attenuation that might preclude
detection of bursts by ground-based Cerenkov telescopes (ACTs), thus motivating
several TeV observational programs. This paper explores the expectations for
the spectral properties in the TeV and sub-TeV bands for bursts, in particular
how attenuation of photons by pair creation internal to the source modifies the
spectrum to produce distinctive spectral signatures. The energy of spectral
breaks and the associated spectral indices provide valuable information that
can constrain the bulk Lorentz factor of the GRB outflow at a given time. These
characteristics define palpable observational goals for ACT programs, and
strongly impact the observability of bursts in the TeV band.

Using a wide field CCD image of the cluster, we optically identify all the
faint X-ray sources, whose counts are compatible with deep X-ray number counts.
In addition we marginally detect the X-ray counter-part of the gravitational
shear perturbation detected by Bonnet et al. (1994) at a 2.5 $\sigma$ level. A
careful spectral analysis of ASCA data is also presented. In particular, we
extract a low resolution spectrum of the cluster free from the contamination by
a nearby point source located 1.2 arcmin from the center. The X-ray temperature
deduced from this analysis is $T_X = 5.7 ^{+4.9}_{-2.1}$ keV at the 90%
confidence level. The comparison between the mass derived from a standard X-ray
analysis and from other methods such as the Virial Theorem or the gravitational
lensing effect lead to a mass discrepancy of a factor 1.5 to 3. We discuss all
the possible sources of uncertainties in each method of mass determination and
give some indications on the way to reduce them. A complementary study of
optical data is in progress and may solve the X-ray/optical discrepancy through
a better understanding of the dynamics of the cluster.

undertake surveys capable of establishing the importance of extinction by dust

with the UVX method. This method exploits the difference between the power-law
nature of quasar spectra and the convex spectra of stars: quasars are
relatively brighter than stars at both short wavelengths (the UVX method) and

directly. The results from the two methods agree very well, with an rms scatter
of 13% in r_e. The half-light radii range from 1 to 20 kpc, with a median of 3
kpc. We compared r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fits to r_{1/2} derived using other
profiles. In particular, we fit Sersic r^{1/n}-laws and superpositions of
r^{1/4}-law bulges with exponential disks. The r_{1/2} derived from the
best-fit Sersic profiles varied with respect to r_e from the r^{1/4}-law fits
by 1% in the median, but with a standard deviation of more than 40%. For the
bulge-plus-disk fits, the derived r_{1/2} were offset from r_e of the
r^{1/4}-law fits by 10% in the mean, also with a standard deviation of more
than 40%. By comparing the Sersic r_{1/2} with those derived from the
bulge-plus-disk fitting, that scatter is also large, at 30%. We conclude that
r_{1/2} is generally measured with a typical accuracy of 30-40%. The large
uncertainties in r_{1/2} do not impact the fundamental plane analysis because
the combination r<I>^{0.76}, which enters the fundamental plane, is extremely
stable. The rms scatter in r<I>^{0.76} is less than 3%, regardless of the form
of the profile fit to the galaxies. We find that the median bulge fraction of
the sample is 84% and that the few E+A galaxies in this sample have disks which
make up about 10-35% of their total light. These results are consistent with
residuals from fitting 2D r^{1/4}-law models directly to the galaxies, in which
disk-like structures are revealed in about half of the sample. Two of the three

efficiencies and lifetimes an order of magnitude longer than their free-fall
times. Their support is attributed to the random supersonic motions observed in
them. We study the support of molecular clouds against gravitational collapse
by supersonic, gas dynamical turbulence using direct numerical simulation.
Computations with two different algorithms are compared: a particle-based,
Lagrangian method (SPH), and a grid-based, Eulerian, second-order method
(ZEUS). The effects of both algorithm and resolution can be studied with this
method. We find that, under typical molecular cloud conditions, global collapse
can indeed be prevented, but density enhancements caused by strong shocks
nevertheless become gravitationally unstable and collapse into dense cores and,
presumably, stars. The occurance and efficiency of local collapse decreases as
the driving wave length decreases and the driving strength increases. It
appears that local collapse can only be prevented entirely with unrealistically
short wave length driving, but observed core formation rates can be reproduced
with more realistic driving. At high collapse rates, cores are formed on short
time scales in coherent structures with high efficiency, while at low collapse
rates they are scattered randomly throughout the region and exhibit
considerable age spread. We suggest that this naturally explains the observed
distinction between isolated and clustered star formation.

lavish archival datasets. These sources, all clearly at z > 1, illustrate the
wide range in the radio and optical properties of distant submm-selected

starburst submm galaxy at high redshift, a z=2.56 interacting galaxy which
shows no obvious sign of hosting an AGN. The remaining sources have varying
degrees of inferred AGN activity (3 from 7 of the most luminous show some
evidence of the presence of an AGN) although even when an AGN is obviously
present it is still not apparent if reprocessed radiation from this source
dominates the submm emission. In contrast with the variation in the spectral
properties, we see relatively homogeneous morphologies for the population, with
a large fraction of merging or interacting systems. Our study shows that
virtually identical SEDs are seen for galaxies which exhibit strikingly
different opt/UV spectral-line characteristics. We conclude that standard
opt/UV spectral classifications are misleading when applied to distant, highly

principal. This entails relaxation, i.e., decrease of the rotational energy,
with the angular momentum preserved. The spin about the major-inertia axis
corresponds to the minimal kinetic energy, for a fixed angular momentum. Thence
one may expect comets and asteroids (as well as spacecraft or cosmic-dust
granules) stay in this, so-called principal, state of rotation, unless they are
forced out of this state by a collision, or a tidal interaction, or cometary
jetting, or by whatever other reason. As is well known, comet P/Halley,
asteroid 4179 Toutatis, and some other small bodies exhibit very complex
rotational motions attributed to these objects being in non-principal states of
spin. Most probably, the asteroid and cometary wobble is quite a generic
phenomenon. The theory of wobble with internal dissipation has not been fully
developed as yet. In this article we demonstrate that in some spin states the
effectiveness of the inelastic-dissipation process is several orders of
magnitude higher than believed previously, and can be measured, by the
presently available observational instruments, within approximately a year
span. We also show that in some other spin states both the precession and
precession-relaxation processes slow down considerably. (We call it
near-separatrix lingering effect.) Such spin states may evolve so slowly that
they can mimic the principal-rotation state.

pulsar motion. This picture is common among the asymmetric explosion models. So
if we assume that the pulsar motion is caused by an asymmetric supernova
explosion, the neutron star born in SN 1987A, which has not been found yet,
will be moving in the southern part of the remnant. In other words, if we can
find one neutron star in SN 1987A on the south part of the remnant, asymmetric
explosion models will be supported by the observation better than the binary
models.

  The FIR and UV properties of this sample are compared to the mean properties
of the local Universe deduced from the luminosity distributions at both

larger than the ratio of the FIR and UV luminosity densities, this effect
becoming worse as the galaxies become brighter: the increase of the UV (0.2
microns) extinction is about 0.5 mag per decade of FIR (60 microns) luminosity.
Quantitative star formation rates are estimated by adding the contribution of
the FIR and UV emissions. They are found consistent with the corrections for
extinction deduced from the FIR to UV flux ratio. A total local volume-average
star formation rate is calculated by summing the contribution of the FIR and UV
wavelengths bands. Each band contributes for an almost similar amount to the
total star formation rate with rho_{SFR} = 0.03 +/- 0.01 h M solar/yr/Mpc^3 at

local luminosity density at 0.2 microns. The trend of a larger FIR to UV flux
ratio for a larger FIR luminosity found for our sample of nearby galaxies is
extended and amplified toward the very large FIR luminosities when we consider

properties of strongly correlated electron models on large lattices. The
technique, which resembles Green's Function Monte Carlo, projects the ground
state component from a trial wave function with no approximations. We use this
method to determine the phase diagram of the two-dimensional t-J model, using
the Maxwell construction to investigate electronic phase separation. The shell
effects of fermions on finite-sized periodic lattices are minimized by keeping
the number of electrons fixed at a closed-shell configuration and varying the
size of the lattice. Results obtained for various electron numbers
corresponding to different closed-shells indicate that the finite-size effects
in our calculation are small. For any value of interaction strength, we find
that there is always a value of the electron density above which the system can
lower its energy by forming a two-component phase separated state. Our results
are compared with other calculations on the t-J model. We find that the most
accurate results are consistent with phase separation at all interaction
strengths.

mechanical processes in spacetime which in (Euclidean) optics correspond to
wave processes in a ``Mach-Zehnder'' interferometer: amplitude splitting,
reflection, and interference. These processes are described in terms of
amplitudes which behave smoothly across the event horizons of all four Rindler
sectors. In this context there arises quite naturally a complete set of
orthonormal wave packet histories, one of whose key properties is their
""explosivity index"". In the limit of low index values the wave packets trace
out fuzzy world lines. By contrast, in the asymptotic limit of high index
values, there are no world lines, not even fuzzy ones. Instead, the wave packet
histories are those of entities with non-trivial internal collapse and
explosion dynamics. Their details are described by the wave processes in the
above-mentioned Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Each one of them is a double slit
interference process. These wave processes are applied to elucidate the
amplification of waves in an accelerated inhomogeneous dielectric. Also
discussed are the properties and relationships among the transition amplitudes

show that they are in good agreement near this phase transition. Since
perturbation theory plays an important role, it is important to choose a
discretization of the gauge-fixing action such that lattice perturbation theory
is valid. Indeed, we find numerical evidence that lattice actions not

magnetic and chromomagnetic operators with a factor of alpha_s and weighted by

transition of an overdamped classical O(3) model in 2+1 dimensions. The phase
transition is triggered through an external, time-dependent effective mass,
parameterized by quench timescale \tau. When measured near the end of the
transition the texture separation and the texture width scale respectively as
\tau^(0.39 \pm 0.02) and \tau^(0.46 \pm 0.04), significantly larger than
\tau^(0.25) predicted from the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We show that
Kibble-Zurek scaling is recovered at very early times but that by the end of
the transition the power-laws result instead from a competition between the
length scale determined at freeze-out and the ordering dynamics of a textured
system. In the context of phase ordering these results suggest that the
multiple length scales characteristic of the late-time ordering of a textured
system derive from the critical dynamics of a single nonequilibrium correlation
length. In the context of defect formation these results imply that significant
evolution of the defect network can occur before the end of the phase
transition. Therefore a quantitative understanding of the defect network at the
end of the phase transition generally requires an understanding of both
critical dynamics and the interactions among topological defects.

step-by-step reduction procedures. As particular examples in this framework, we
discuss the reduction of time-dependent dynamical systems with symmetry, the
reduction of a mechanical model of field theories with gauge and non-gauge
symmetries, and the gauge reduction of the system made of a conformal particle.

"math/9911026","Mark C. Lammers","Peter G. Casazza and M. C. Lammers","Bracket products for Weyl-Heisenberg frames","37 pages",,,,"math.FA",,"  We provide a detailed development of a function valued inner product known as
the bracket product and used effectively by de Boor,
  Devore, Ron and Shen to study translation invariant systems. We develop a
version of the bracket product specifically geared to
  Weyl-Heisenberg frames. This bracket product has all the properties of a
standard inner product including Bessel's inequality, a Riesz Representation
Theorem, and a Gram-Schmidt process which turns a sequence of functions
$(g_{n})$ into a sequence $(e_{n})$ with the property that
$(E_{mb}e_{n})_{m,n\in \Bbb Z}$ is orthonormal in $L^{2}(\Bbb R)$. Armed with
this inner product, we obtain several results concerning Weyl-Heisenberg
frames. First we see that fiberization in this setting takes on a particularly
simple form and we use it to obtain a compressed representation of the frame
operator. Next, we write down explicitly all those functions $g\in
  L^{2}(\Bbb R)$ and $ab=1$ so that the family $(E_{mb}T_{na}g)$ is complete in
$L^{2}(\Bbb R)$. One consequence of this is that for functions $g$ supported on
a half-line $[{\alpha},\infty)$ (in particular, for compactly supported $g$),
$(g,1,1)$ is complete if and only if $\text{sup}_{0\le t< a}|g(t-n)|\not= 0$
a.e. Finally, we give a direct proof of a result hidden in the literature by
proving: For any $g\in L^{2}(\Bbb R)$, $A\le \sum_{n}
  |g(t-na)|^{2}\le B$ is equivalent to $(E_{m/a}g)$ being a Riesz basic
sequence.

which is now called the Weyl-Heisenberg Frame Identity. WH-Frame Identity: If
$g\in W(L^{\infty},L^{1})$, then for all continuous, compactly supported
functions f we have: \[\sum_{m,n}|<f,E_{mb}T_{na}g>|^{2} =
\frac{1}{b}\sum_{k}\int_{\Bbb R}\bar{f(t)}f(t-k/b)\sum_{n}
g(t-na)\bar{g(t-na-k/b)} dt.\] It has been folklore that the identity will not
hold universally. We make a detailed study of the WH-Frame Identity and show:
(1) The identity does not require any assumptions on ab (such as the
requirement that $ab\le 1$ to have a frame); (2) As stated above, the identity
holds for all $f\in L^{2}(\Bbb R)$; (3) The identity holds for all bounded,
compactly supported functions if and only if $g\in L^{2}(\Bbb R)$; (4) The
identity holds for all compactly supported functions if and only if
$\sum_{n}|g(x-na)|^{2}\le B$ a.e.; Moreover, in (2)-(4) above, the series on
the right converges unconditionally; (5) In general, there are WH-frames and
functions $f\in L^{2}(\Bbb R)$ so that the series on the right does not
converge (even symmetrically). We give necessary and sufficient conditions for
it to converge symmetrically; (6) There are WH-frames for which the series on
the right always converges symmetrically to give the WH-Frame Identity, but
there are functions for which the series does not converge and we classify when
the series converges for all functions $f\in \L$; (7) There are WH-frames for
which the series always converges, but it does not converge unconditionally for
some functions, and we classify when we have unconditional convergence for all
functions f; and (8) We show that the series converges unconditionally for all
$f\in L^{2}(\Bbb R)$ if g satisfies the CC-condition.

Close to the turning point of the mirror, the atoms are transferred into an

ultimately yield an optically-driven atom laser. An important issue is the
suppression of photon scattering due to ``cross-talk'' between the mirror
potential and the trapping potential. We propose that for alkali atoms the
photon scattering rate can be suppressed by several orders of magnitude if the
atoms are decoupled from the evanescent-wave light. We discuss how such dark
states can be achieved by making use of circularly-polarized evanescent waves.
