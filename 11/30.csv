conduct with the XMM X-ray satellite. We have modeled the expected properties
of such a survey for three different cosmological models, using an extended
Press-Schechter (Press & Schechter 1974) formalism, combined with a detailed
characterization of the expected capabilities of the EPIC camera on board XMM.
We estimate that, over the ten year design lifetime of XMM, the EPIC camera
will image a total of ~800 square degrees in fields suitable for the
serendipitous detection of clusters of galaxies. For the presently-favored
low-density model with a cosmological constant, our simulations predict that
this survey area would yield a catalogue of more than 8000 clusters, ranging
from poor to very rich systems, with around 750 detections above z=1. A
low-density open Universe yields similar numbers, though with a different
redshift distribution, while a critical-density Universe gives considerably
fewer clusters. This dependence of catalogue properties on cosmology means that
the proposed survey will place strong constraints on the values of Omega-Matter
and Omega-Lambda. The survey would also facilitate a variety of follow-up
projects, including the quantification of evolution in the cluster X-ray
luminosity-temperature relation, the study of high-redshift galaxies via
gravitational lensing, follow-up observations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
and foreground analyses of cosmic microwave background maps.

redshift (0.1<z<0.2) clusters which have bimodal X-ray surface brightness
profiles. We find that at least two of these clusters exhibit unusually high
fractions of blue galaxies as compared to clusters at comparable redshifts
studied by Butcher and Oemler (1984). This implies that star formation is
occurring in a high fraction of the galaxies in the two clusters. Our results
are consistent with hierarchical clustering models in which subcluster-
subcluster mergers create shocks in the intracluster medium. The shocks, in
turn, induce simultaneous starbursts in a large fraction of cluster galaxies.
Our study therefore lends weight to the hypothesis that the Butcher-Oemler
effect is an environmental, as well as evolutionary, phenomenon.

consistent with our standard gravitational instability theory. New accurate
data and reconstruction methods allow high-resolution dynamical analysis
nearby, revealing Virgo, Ursa Major and Fornax as attractors. Large
peculiar-velocity surveys enable robust reconstruction of the dynamical fields
on the Great-Attractor scale. A decomposition of the velocity field into its
local and tidal components indicates the presence of big perturbations further
away. Cluster velocities start exploring very large scales, revealing Coma,
Shapely and other mass enhancements, and constraining a possible local Hubble
bubble. Supernovae type Ia (SNIa) are very promising for cosmic flow analysis.
Peculiar velocities do provide unique valuable constraints on cosmological
parameters, e.g., 0.3<Omega_m<1 (95% confidence) independent of biasing.
Jointly with other data they can confine other parameters such as Omega_Lambda,
h, sigma_8, n, and the biasing. Nontrivial features of the biasing scheme can
explain much of the span of estimates for beta. Quantitative error analysis is
essential in our maturing field; every method ought to be calibrated with
suitable mock catalogs, that are offered as benchmarks.

variability studies of RL AGNs, which show that these systems have
systematically different X-ray properties than their radio-quiet (RQ)
counterparts. Specifically, RL AGNs have weaker and narrower Fe K lines and
weaker Compton reflection components above 10 keV. The nuclear continuum of RL
AGNs in the 2--10 keV band is well described by a power law with photon indices
$\sim$ 1.8, similar to RQ AGNs of comparable X-ray luminosity. RL AGNs have
little or no flux variability on short time scales (\ltsima 0.5 days); however,
flux and spectral variations are observed on time scales of weeks in two
well-monitored objects, 3C~390.3 and 3C~120. These properties strongly suggest
that the central engines of the two AGNs classes are different. We discuss the
implications of these observational results, in particular the possibility that
the central engines of RL AGNs are harbor an ion torus (also known as an
Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow or ADAF). We show that a beamed component
from the jet is unlikely in the majority of sources.
  Moreover, the X-ray data provide evidence that the circumnuclear environs of
RL and RQ AGNs also differ: large amounts of cold gas are detected in BLRGs and
QSRs, contrary to Seyfert galaxies of similar X-ray luminosity where an ionized
absorber seems to be the norm. The role of future X-ray missions in advancing
our understanding of the central engines of RL AGNs is briefly highlighted.

percent of the initial number of stars in the cluster). The distribution of
single stars is treated as a conducting gas sphere with a standard anisotropic
gaseous model. A Monte Carlo technique is used to model the motion of binaries,
their formation and subsequent hardening by close encounters, and their
relaxation (dynamical friction) with single stars and other binaries. The
results are a further approach towards a realistic model of globular clusters
with primordial binaries without using special hardware. We present, as our
main result, the self-consistent evolution of a cluster consisting of 300.000
equal point-mass stars, plus 30.000 equal mass binaries over several hundred
half-mass relaxation times, well into the phase where most of the binaries have
been dissolved and evacuated from the core. In a self-consistent model it is
the first time that such a realistically large number of binaries is evolving
in a cluster with an even ten times larger number of single stars. Due to the
Monte Carlo treatment of the binaries we can at every moment analyze their
external and internal parameters in the cluster as in an N-body simulation.

variety of resonant transitions, for example the HI Lyman series lines (most

probes of the kinematics, physical conditions and elemental abundances in the
gas near AGNs. Studies of intrinsic absorbers have historically emphasized the
broad absorption lines (BALs) in quasars. Today we recognize a wider variety of
intrinsic lines in a wider range of objects. For example, we now know that
Seyfert 1 galaxies (the less luminous cousins of quasars) have intrinsic
absorption. We also realize that intrinsic lines can form in a range of AGN
environments --- from the dynamic inner regions like the BALs, to the more
quiescent outer host galaxies >10 kpc away. This article provides a brief
introduction to current observational and theoretical work on intrinsic AGN
absorbers.

of the newly-observed Pleiades and Hyades stars are ~ 0.4 M_{\sun} and ~ 0.2
M_{\sun}, respectively. We combine our new observations with previously
published data to explore the rotational evolution of young stars with M < 0.4
M_\sun. The average rotation rate in the Hyades (age 600 Myr) is about 0.4 that
of the Pleiades (110 Myr), and the mean equivalent widths of H-alpha are also
lower. As found in previous studies, the correlation between rotation and
chromospheric activity is identical in both clusters, implying that the lower
activity in the Hyades is a result of the lower rotation rates. We show that a
simple scaling of the Pleiades rotational distribution for M \leq 0.4 M_{\sun},
corrected for the effects of structural evolution, matches that of the Hyades
if the average angular momentum loss from the Pleiades to the Hyades age is
factor of \approx 6. This suggests that the distribution of initial angular
momenta and disk-locking lifetimes for the lowest mass stars was similar in
both clusters. We argue that this result provides further evidence for a
saturation of the angular momentum loss rate at high rotational velocities.

stars are heated by the accreted matter at the stellar surface, but on the
other hand they are also cooled down by the neutrino radiation. At the same
time, the accreted matter transports its angular momentum and mass to the star.
We have studied the evolution of the stellar mass, temperature and rotational
frequency.
  The gravitational-wave-driven instability of the r-mode oscillation strongly
suppresses spinning-up of the star, whose final rotational frequency is well
below the mass-shedding limit, typically as small as 10% of that of the
mass-shedding state. On a very short time scale the rotational frequency tends
to approach a certain constant value and saturates there as far as the amount
of the accreted mass does not exceed a certain limit to collapse to a black
hole. This implies that the similar mechanism of gravitational radiation as the
so-called Wagoner star may work in this process. The star is spun up by
accretion until the angular momentum loss by gravitational radiation balances
the accretion torque. The time-integrated dimensionless strain of the radiated
gravitational wave may be large enough to be detectable by the gravitational
wave detectors such as LIGO II.

of the stars, giving rise to deconfinement of crustal matter to strange matter,

that any metric-based gravitational theory that proposes to explain the flat
rotation curves of disk galaxies without postulating dark matter halos must
conflict with observations of gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters of
galaxies because any such theory inevitably make a negative contribution to
light deflection. Here we show that some of the basic steps of Edery's argument
are invalid, and no such general result obtains.

switchable microdomains that are present accidentally in single crystals but
are systematically more numerous in powders. A very different after-effect was
observed in a narrow T range around 7-8 K. Real permittivity jumped to a lower

of a domain wall, consisting of a single H-bond reversal. The anomalous
after-effect results from the interaction between these point defects and the

D61 (2000) 105014","10.1103/PhysRevD.61.105014",,"hep-ph astro-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  The dynamics of a symmetry breaking phase transition is studied in a
radiation and matter dominated spatially flat FRW cosmology in the large N
limit of a scalar field theory.The quantum density matrix is evolved from an
initial state of quasiparticles in thermal equilibrium at a temperature higher
than the critical. The cosmological expansion decreases the temperature and
triggers the phase transition. We identify three different time scales: an
early regime dominated by linear instabilities and the exponential growth of
long-wavelength fluctuations,an intermediate scale when the field fluctuations
probe the broken symmetry states and an asymptotic scale wherein a scaling
regime emerges for modes of wavelength comparable to or larger than the
horizon.The scaling regime is characterized by a dynamical physical correlation
length xi_{phys} = d_H(t) with d_H(t) the size of the causal horizon, thus
there is one correlated region per causal horizon. Inside these correlated
regions the field fluctuations sample the broken symmetry states. The amplitude
of the long-wavelength fluctuations becomes non-perturbatively large due to the
early times instabilities and a semiclassical but stochastic description
emerges in the asymptotic regime. In the scaling regime, the power spectrum is
peaked at zero momentum revealing the onset of a Bose-Einstein condensate.The
scaling solution results in that the equation of state of the scalar fields is
the same as that of the background fluid. This implies a Harrison-Zeldovich
spectrum of scalar density perturbations for long-wavelengths. We discuss the
corrections to scaling as well as the universality of the scaling solution and
the differences and similarities with the classical non-linear sigma model.

addition to the one B-S scalar function in the limit m_Q -> \infty, two more
scalar functions are needed at the order 1/m_Q. These can be related to the B-S
scalar function in the leading order. The six form factors for the weak
transition \Lambda_b -> \Lambda_c are expressed in terms of these wave
functions and the results are consistent with heavy quark effective theory to
order 1/m_Q. Assuming the kernel for the B-S equation in the limit m_Q ->

obtain numerical solutions for the B-S wave functions, and hence for the

the ansatz by deriving the d=7 supersymmetry laws from the d=11 transformation
laws in the various sectors. The ansatz itself is nonpolynomial but the final

ansatz for the 4-form F. It satisfies the Bianchi identities. The corresponding

and T-matrices arising from the braiding. Such a coupling matrix is not
necessarily of ""type I"", i.e. in general it does not have a block-diagonal
structure which can be reinterpreted as the diagonal coupling matrix with
respect to a suitable extension. We show that there are always two intermediate
subfactors which correspond to left and right maximal extensions and which
determine ""parent"" coupling matrices Z^\pm of type I. Moreover it is shown that
if the intermediate subfactors coincide, so that Z^+=Z^-, then Z is related to
Z^+ by an automorphism of the extended fusion rules. The intertwining relations
of chiral branching coefficients between original and extended S- and
T-matrices are also clarified. None of our results depends on non-degeneracy of
the braiding, i.e. the S- and T-matrices need not be modular. Examples from
SO(n) current algebra models illustrate that the parents can be different,
Z^+\neq Z^-, and that Z need not be related to a type I invariant by such an
automorphism.

  Whistler Mode Wave Particle Interactions in Planetary Magnetospheres","14 pages, latex, 5 figures, submittes to PSS",,,,"physics.space-ph",,"  The chaotic interaction between electrons and whistler mode waves has been
shown to provide a mechanism for enhanced diffusion in phase space. Pitch angle
diffusion is relevant for the scattering of electrons into the loss cones, thus
providing a source for auroral precipitating electrons. A single whistler mode
wave propagating parallel to the background magnetic field has resonance with
the electrons but the process is not stochastic. The presence of a second,
oppositely directed whistler wave has been shown previously to introduce
stochasticity into the system, thus enhancing phase space diffusion. Here we
generalise previous work to include relativistic effects. The full relativistic
Lorentz equations are solved numerically to permit application to a more
extensive parameter space. We consider parameters scaled to intrinsic planetary
magnetospheres, for electron populations with 'pancake' velocity distributions
i.e. large anisotropies in velocity space. We show that the diffusion is rapid,
occuring on timescales of the order of tens of electron gyroperiods, and is
strongly sensitive to the wave amplitude, the wave frequency and the
perpendicular velocity. Using Voyager 1 data we give an estimate of the
whistler wave amplitude in the Io torus at Jupiter and show that the two
whistler mechanism produces pitch angle diffusion of up to 10 degrees from an
initial pancake distribution, on millisecond timescales.

under local quantum operations and classical communication. We show that
$k$-positive maps witness Schmidt number, in the same way that positive maps
witness entanglement. We show that the family of states which is made from
mixing the completely mixed state and a maximally entangled state have
increasing Schmidt number depending on the amount of maximally entangled state
that is mixed in. We show that Schmidt number {\it does not necessarily
increase} when taking tensor copies of a density matrix $\rho$; we give an
example of a density matrix for which the Schmidt numbers of $\rho$ and $\rho
\otimes \rho$ are both 2.

oscillator Hamiltonian operator H, where H = -(d/dx)^2 + Bx^2+ A/x^2 +

formalism makes use of a basis provided by exact solutions of Schroedinger's
equation for the Gol'dman and Krivchenkov Hamiltonian (alpha = 2), and the
corresponding matrix elements that were previously found. For all the discrete
eigenvalues the method provides bounds which improve as the dimension of the
basis set is increased. Extension to the N-dimensional case in arbitrary
angular-momentum subspaces is also presented. By minimizing over the free
parameter A, we are able to reduce substantially the number of basis functions
needed for a given accuracy.
