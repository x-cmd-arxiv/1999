T Tauri stars and 1 ""weak-line"" T Tauri star along the line of sight to the
cloud. Because of the proximity of the cloud to the sun, all of the previously
known TTS along this line of sight were detected in the 25 ks ROSAT PSPC
pointed observation of the cloud. We conducted follow-up optical spectroscopy
at the 2.2-meter telescope at Calar Alto to look for signatures of youth in
additional X-ray selected T Tauri star candidates. These observations allowed
us to confirm the existence of 4 additional TTS associated with the cloud and
at least 2 young main sequence stars that are not associated with the cloud and
place an upper limit on the age of the TTS in MBM12 ~ 10 Myr.
  The distance to MBM12 has been revised from the previous estimate of 65+-5 pc
to 65+-35 pc based on results of the Hipparcos satellite. At this distance
MBM12 is the nearest known molecular cloud to the sun with recent star
formation. We estimate a star-formation efficiency for the cloud of 2-24%.
  We have also identified a reddened G9 star behind the cloud with Av ~ 8.4-8.9
mag. Therefore, there are at least two lines of sight through the cloud that
show larger extinctions (Av > 5 mag) than previously thought for this cloud.
This higher extinction explains why MBM12 is capable of star-formation while
most other high-latitude clouds are not.

as a^{-2}, where a is the scale factor of the universe, the fate of the
universe in regard to whether it will collapse in future or expand forever is
determined not by the curvature constant k but by an effective curvature
constant k_{eff}. It is argued that a closed universe with k=1 may expand
forever, in other words simulate the expansion dynamics of a flat or an open
universe because of the possibility that k_{eff}=0 or -1, respectively. Two
such models, in one of which the vacuum does not interact with matter and in
another of which it does, are studied. It is shown that the vacuum equation of
state p_{vac}= -\rho_{vac} may be realized in a decaying vacuum cosmology
provided the vacuum interacts wuth matter. The optical depths for gravitational
lensing as a function of the matter density and other parameters in the models
are calculated at a source redshift of 2. The age of the universe is discussed

spectrum exponent in avalanche models, and in particular, in variations of the
zero-temperature random-field Ising model. We find that the naive exponent,
(3-tau)/(sigma nu z), which has been derived in several other papers, is in
general incorrect for small tau, when large avalanches are common. (tau is the
exponent describing the distribution of avalanche sizes, and (sigma nu z) is
the exponent describing the relationship between avalanche size and avalanche
duration.) We find that for a large class of avalanche models, including
several models of Barkhausen noise, the correct exponent for tau<2 is 1/(sigma
nu z). We explicitly derive the mean-field exponent of 2. In the process, we
calculate the average avalanche shape for avalanches of fixed duration and
scaling forms for a number of physical properties.

geometry, the other by gauge theory) on the set of isomorphism classes of
holomorphic bundles with section on a given compact complex manifold. In the
case of line bundles, these complex spaces are shown to be isomorphic to a
space of effective divisors on the manifold.

algebraic-geometric data an infinite-dimensional subspace in the space k((z))
of the Laurent power series. The construction was successfully used in the
theory of integrable systems, particularly, for the KP and KdV equations. There
were also found some applications to the moduli of algebraic curves. But there
remained a hard restriction by the case of curves, so by dimension 1. Recently,
it was pointed out by the author that there are some connections between the
theory of the KP-equations and the theory of n-dimensional local fields. From
this point of view it becomes clear that the Krichever construction should have
a generalization to the case of higher dimensions. This generalization is
suggested in the paper for the case of algebraic surfaces.

quantum dots and trapped ions are based on the using of an atom or an ion as
one qubit. In these proposals a quantum computer consists from several atoms
and the coupling between them provides the coupling between qubits necessary
for a quantum gate. We discuss whether a {\it single} atom can be used as a
quantum computer. Internal states of the atom serve to hold the quantum
information and the spin-orbit and spin-spin interaction provides the coupling
between qubits in the atomic quantum computer. In particular one can use the
electron spin resonance (ESR) to process the information encoded in the
hyperfine splitting of atomic energy levels. By using quantum state engineering
one can manipulate the internal states of the natural or artificial (quantum
dot) atom to make quantum computations.
