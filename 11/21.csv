sensitively depends on the anisotropy of the models. By comparing the results
of calculations with the experimental facts, where the effects of quantum
fluctuation is incorporated by mapping the stripe-type charge ordered states to

Furthermore, to obtain a unified view among the $\theta$, $\alpha$ and

competition with the dimeric antiferromagnetic state viewed as the Mott
insulating state, which is typically realized in $\kappa$-type compounds, and

threshold, the additive noise induces limit cycles. The coherence of the system
is optimized by the noise. A bell-shaped curve is found for the peak height of
power spectra of the spike train, being significantly different from a
monotonic behavior for the single neuron. The coupling of the network can
enhance CR in two different ways. In particular, when the coupling is strong
enough, the synchronization of the system is induced and optimized by the
noise. This synchronization leads to a high and wide plateau in the local
measure of coherence curve. The local-noise-induced limit cycle can evolve to a
refined spatiotemporal order through the dynamical optimization among the
autonomous oscillation of an individual neuron, the coupling of the network,
