ensembles in the region between 0.06 and 0.21 AU from the Sun, in order to
constrain the probable population density and population structure of this
region today. Dynamical studies have shown that the Vulcanoid Zone (VZ) could
be populated. However, we find that the frequency and energetics of collisional
evolution this close to the Sun, coupled with the efficient radiation transport
of small debris out of this region, together conspire to create an active and
highly intensive collisional environment which depletes any very significant
population of rocky bodies placed in it, unless the bodies exhibit orbits that
are circular to ~10^-3 or less, or highly lossy mechanical properties that
correspond to a fraction of impact energy significantly less than 10% being
imparted to ejecta. The most favorable locale for residual bodies to survive in
this region is in highly circular orbits near the outer edge of the dynamically
stable Vulcanoid Zone (i.e., near 0.2 AU), where collisional evolution and
radiation transport of small bodies and debris proceed most slowly. If the mean
random orbital eccentricity in this region exceeds ~10^-3, then our work
suggests it is unlikely that more than a few hundred objects with radii larger
than 1 km will be found in the entire VZ; assuming the largest objects have a
radius of 30 km, then the total mass of bodies in the VZ down to 0.1 km radii
is likely to be no more than ~10^-6Mearth, <10^-3 the mass of the asteroid
belt. Despite the dynamical stability of large objects in this region (Evans &
Tabachnik 1999), it is plausible that the entire region is virtually empty of
km-scale and larger objects.

the optimal detection and resolution of caustic crossings. From this

of caustic crossings, therefore, prompt initiation of followup observations for
intensive monitoring of events will be important. We estimate that under the

caustic crossing is $\sim 80%$. We find that if the followup observations can
be initiated within 1 day after the first caustic crossing by adopting more

the polarization properties of pulsar emission in the model. First of all,
using the lower frequency approximation, we derived the analytical amplitude of
inverse Compton scattered wave of a single electron in strong magnetic field.
We found that the out-going radio emission of a single relativistic electron
scattering off the ``low frequency waves'' produced by gap-sparking should be
linearly polarized and have no circular polarization at all. However,
considering the coherency of the emission from a bunch of electrons, we found
that the out-going radiation from the inner part of emission beam, i.e., that
from the lower emission altitudes, prefers to have circular polarization.
Computer simulations show that the polarization properties, such as the sense
reversal of circular polarization near the pulse center, S-shape of position
angle swing of the linear polarization, strong linear polarization in conal
components, can be reproduced in the ICS model.

Spectrometer (ISO-SWS) observations of Jupiter related to ammonia. We focus on
two spectral regions; the first one (the 10-micron region), probes atmospheric
levels between 1 and 0.2 bar, while the second one (the 5-micron window),
sounds the atmosphere between 8 and 2 bars. The two spectral windows cannot be
fitted with the same ammonia vertical distribution. From the 10-micron region
we infer an ammonia distribution of about half the saturation profile above the
1-bar level, where the N/H ratio is roughly solar. A totally different picture
is derived from the 5-micron window, where we determine an upper limit of
3.7E-5 at 1 bar and find an increasing NH3 abundance at least down to 4 bar.
This profile is similar to the one measured by the Galileo probe (Folkner et
al. 1998). The discrepancy between the two spectral regions most likely arises
from the spatial heterogeneity of Jupiter, the 5-micron window sounding dry
areas unveiled by a locally thin cloud cover (the 5-micron hot spots), and the
10-micron region probing the mean jovian atmosphere above 1 bar. The 15NH3
mixing ratio is measured around 400 mbar from nu_2 band absorptions in the
10-micron region. We find the atmosphere of Jupiter highly depleted in 15N at
this pressure level (15N/14N)_{Jupiter}=(1.9^{+0.9}_{-1.))E-3, while
(15N/14N)_{earth}=3.68E-3. It is not clear whether this depletion reveals the
global jovian (15N/14N) ratio. Instead an isotopic fractionation process,
taking place during the ammonia cloud condensation, is indicated as a possible
mechanism. A fractionation coefficient alpha higher than 1.08 would explain the
observed isotopic ratio, but the lack of laboratory data does not allow us to
decide unambiguously on the origin of the observed low (15N/14N) ratio.

  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a model of globular cluster self-enrichment. In the protogalaxy,
cold and dense clouds embedded in the hot protogalactic medium are assumed to
be the progenitors of galactic halo globular clusters. The massive stars of a
first generation of metal-free stars, born in the central areas of the
proto-globular cluster clouds, explode as Type II supernovae. The associated
blast waves trigger the expansion of a supershell, sweeping all the material of
the cloud, and the heavy elements released by these massive stars enrich the
supershell. A second generation of stars is born in these compressed and
enriched layers of gas. These stars can recollapse and form a globular cluster.
This work aims at revising the most often encountered argument against
self-enrichment, namely the presumed ability of a small number of supernovae to
disrupt a proto-globular cluster cloud. We describe a model of the dynamics of
the supershell and of its progressive chemical enrichment. We show that the
minimal mass of the primordial cluster cloud required to avoid disruption by
several tens of Type II supernovae is compatible with the masses usually
assumed for proto-globular cluster clouds. Furthermore, the corresponding
self-enrichment level is in agreement with halo globular cluster metallicities.

estimated through the standard Voigt fitting procedure utilizing a simple
one-component model of the absorbing region. The authors assumed, however, that
`a more complex structure for the hydrogen cloud with somewhat ad hoc
components would allow a higher D/H'. We have investigated this system using
our new Monte Carlo inversion procedure which allows us to recover not only the
physical parameters but also the velocity and density distributions along the
line of sight. The absorption lines of HI, CII, CIV, SiIII, and SiIV were
analyzed simultaneously. The result obtained shows a considerably lower neutral
hydrogen column density log(N_HI) = 15.7 cm^{-2}. Hence, the measurement of the
deuterium abundance in this system is rather uncertain. We find that the
asymmetric blue wing of the hydrogen Ly-alpha absorption is readily explained
by HI alone. Thus, up to now, deuterium was detected in only four QSO spectra

Turbulence fossilization by self-gravitational buoyancy explains the cosmic

binary millisecond pulsar PSR J0218+4232 in 100-1000 MeV data from CGRO EGRET.
Imaging analysis demonstrates that the highly significant gamma-ray source 2EG
J0220+4228 (~10 sigma) is for energies > 100 MeV positionally consistent with
both PSR J0218+4232 and the BL Lac 3C66A. However, above 1 GeV 3C66A is the
evident counterpart, whereas between 100 and 300 MeV PSR J0218+4232 is the most
likely one. Timing analysis using one ephemeris valid for all EGRET
observations yields in the 100-1000 MeV range a double-pulse profile at a ~3.5
sigma significance level. The phase separation is similar to the component
separation of ~0.47 observed at X-rays. A comparison of the gamma-ray profile
with the 610 MHz radio profile in absolute phase shows that the two gamma- ray
pulses coincide with two of the three emission features in the complex radio
profile.

the observed flux and spectrum of cosmic rays at the highest energies. However,
recent observations indicate that the redshift distribution of GRBs most likely
follows that of the star formation rate in the universe, a rate which was much
higher at redshifts 1.5-2 than it is today. Thus, most GRBs are at high
redshifts. As a consequence, any cosmic rays emitted by these GRBs at energies
above 2-3 X 10^{19} eV would be strongly attenuated by interactions with the 3K
background radiation. If one assumes rough equality between the energy released
in 10^{-2} to 1 MeV photons and that released in 10^{20} eV cosmic rays, then
less than 10 per cent of the cosmic rays observed above 10^{20} eV can be
accounted for by GRBs.

These shocks can accelerate electrons, protons to energies high enough for

not depend on time monotonously. For the case of small dissipation we detected
two regimes of evolution of the velocity distribution function: Starting from
the initial Maxwellian distribution, the deviation first increases with time on
a collision time-scale saturating at some maximal value; then it decays to zero
on much larger time-scale which corresponds to the temperature relaxation. For
larger values of the dissipation parameter there appears an additional

of research was initiated in 1984 by Rivest and Sherman who designed two-party

associative one-way functions as their key building blocks. If commutativity is
added as an ingredient, these protocols can be used by more than two parties,
as noted by Rabi and Sherman [RS93] who also developed digital signature
protocols that are based on such enhanced one-way functions.
  Until recently, it was an open question whether one-way functions having the
algebraic and security properties that these protocols require could be created
from any given one-way function. Recently, Hemaspaandra and Rothe [HR99]
resolved this open issue in the affirmative, by showing that one-way functions
exist if and only if strong, total, commutative, associative one-way functions
exist.

the fundamental scales such as the Planck, string or unification scales. Our
fourth light neutrino $\nu_s$ ($s$ for sterile) is identified with the zero
mode of the Kaluza-Klein states. To first approximation \nu_sterile combines
with the nu_mu in order to form a Dirac neutrino with mass in the eV range
leaving the other two neutrinos massless. The smallness of this mass scale
(suitable for LSND and Hot Dark Matter) arises without appealing neither to a
see-saw mechanism nor to a radiative mechanism, but from the volume factor
associated with the canonical normalization of the wave-function of the bulk
field in the compactified dimensions. % On the other hand the splitting between

First, the problem of constructing Lorentz-invariant self-couplings of a single

on the energy-momentum tensor commutation relations. We show how the
Perry-Schwarz condition follows from the Dirac-Schwinger criterion and point
out that consistency of the gravitational coupling is automatic. Secondly, we
study the possible local deformations of chiral two-forms. This problem reduces
to the study of the local BRST cohomological group at ghost number zero. We
proof that the only consistent deformations of a system of free chiral
two-forms are (up to redefinitions) deformations that do not modify the abelian
gauge symmetries of the free theory. The consequence of this result for a
system consisting of a number of parallel M5-branes is explained.

such that dim D(i)=i+2, for i=0,...,n-2, where D(i) denotes the derived flag of

appeared first in the work of E. von Weber and E. Cartan, who have shown that
on an open and dense subset they can be converted into the so-called Goursat
normal form. Later, Goursat structures have been studied by Kumpera and Ruiz.
Contact structures on three manifolds and Engel structures on four manifolds
are examples of Goursat structures. In the paper, we introduce a new invariant
for Goursat structures, called the singularity type, and prove that the growth
vector and the abnormal curves of all elements of the derived flag are
determined by this invariant. Then we show, using a generalized version of
Backlund's theorem, that abnormal curves of all elements of the derived flag do
not determine the local equivalence class of a Goursat structure if n>8. We
also propose a new proof of a classical theorem of Kumpera and Ruiz. All

The second one is dealing with the Coulomb excitation of ultrarelativistic
heavy ions resulting in their deep disintegration. The third topic is devoted
to the description of a first order phase transition in rapidly expanding
matter. The resulting picture is that a strong collective flow of matter will
lead to the fragmentation of a metastable phase into droplets. If the
transition from quark-gluon plasma to hadron gas is of the first order it will
manifest itself by strong nonstatistical fluctuations in observable hadron
distributions.

in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In particular their production at SPS,
RHIC, and LHC energies is re-examined in view of the results of Aurenche et al
which show that the rate of photon production from quark gluon plasma,
evaluated at the order of two loops far exceeds the rates evaluated at one-loop
level which have formed the basis of all the estimates of photons so far. We
find that the production of photons from quark matter could easily out-shine
those from the hadronic matter in certain ideal conditions. We further show
that the earlier results lending support to the possibility of quark-hadron
phase transition from the measured yield of single photons in $S+Au$ collisions
at CERN SPS remain valid when an account is made for these developments, though
they leave a scope for the formation of (chemically) non-equilibrated plasma.

flows in critical phenomena. The physical solutions of the Lorentz-Dirac
equation lie on the critical surface. The critical surface is repelling, i.e.
any slight deviation from it is amplified and as a result the solution runs
away to infinity. On the other hand, Dirac's asymptotic condition (acceleration
vanishes for long times) forces the solution to be on the critical manifold.
The critical surface can be determined perturbatively. Thereby one obtains an
effective second order equation, which we apply to various cases, in particular
to the motion of an electron in a Penning trap.

conserved currents can be found for the field strengths and the electric or

strengths only (in the presence of electric and magnetic sources). Another new
feature is the construction of a Lagrangian invariant under the duality
transformation for both field strengths and electric and magnetic sources. The
conserved current, after the elimination of electric and magnetic sources,
depends on the field strengths only. The conserved quantity is related to the
total helicity of the electromagnetic field.

levels of grids starting from the coarsest grid, with wave functions
transferred to each finer level. The only changes compared to a single grid
calculation are interpolation and orthonormalization steps outside the original
total energy calculation and required only for transferring between grids. This
feature results in a minimal amount of code change, and enables us to employ a
sophisticated interpolation method and noninteger ratio of grid spacings.
Calculations employing a preconditioned conjugate gradient method are presented
for two examples, a quantum dot and a charged molecular system. Use of three
grid levels with grid spacings 2h, 1.5h, and h decreases the computer time by
about a factor of 5 compared to single level calculations.

quantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers) can be ``chaotic''
superpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants, products of
spin or qubit states). This is a result of the very high energy level density
of many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between
particles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of
entropy in such chaotic systems.
  As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A
time scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is
the qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1. At t <<
t_c the entropy is small: S= n t^2 J^2 log_2(1/t^2 J^2), where J is the
inter-qubit interaction strength. At t > t_c the number of ``wrong'' states
increases exponentially as 2^{S(t)} . Therefore, t_c may be interpreted as a
maximal time for operation of a quantum computer, since at t > t_c one has to
struggle against the second law of thermodynamics. At t >>t_c the system
entropy approaches that for chaotic eigenstates.
