in a system of employed (immobile) and unemployed (mobile) agents which respond
to local wage gradients. Dependent on the local economic situation, described
by a production function which includes cooperative effects, employed agents
can become unemployed and vice versa. The spatio-temporal distribution of
employed and unemployed agents is investigated both analytically and by means
of stochastic computer simulations. We find the establishment of distinct
economic centers out of a random initial distribution. The evolution of these
centers occurs in two different stages: (i) small economic centers are formed
based on the positive feedback of mutual stimulation/cooperation among the
agents, (ii) some of the small centers grow at the expense of others, which
finally leads to the concentration of the labor force in different extended
economic regions. This crossover to large-scale production is accompanied by an
increase in the unemployment rate. We observe a stable coexistence between
these regions, although they exist in an internal quasistationary
non-equilibrium state and still follow a stochastic eigendynamics.

limited sample of seven nearby edge-on starburst galaxies. Here, we examine the
two X-ray-brightest sample members NGC 253 and M 82 in a self-consistent
manner, taking account of the spatial distribution of the X-ray emission in
choosing our spectral models. There is significant X-ray absorption in the disk
of NGC 253. When this is accounted for we find that multi-temperature thermal
plasma models with significant underlying soft X-ray absorption are more
consistent with the imaging data than single-temperature models with highly
subsolar abundances or models with minimal absorption and non-equilibrium
thermal ionization conditions. Our models do not require absolute abundances
that are inconsistent with solar values or unusually supersolar ratios of the
alpha-burning elements with respect to Fe (as claimed previously). We conclude
that with current data, the technique of measuring abundances in starburst
galaxies via X-ray spectral modeling is highly uncertain.
  Based on the point-like nature of much of the X-ray emission in the PSPC
hard-band image of NGC 253, we suggest that a significant fraction of the
``extended'' X-ray emission in the 3-10 keV band seen along the disk of the
galaxy with ASCA and BeppoSAX (Cappi et al.) is comprised of discrete sources
in the disk, as opposed to purely diffuse, hot gas. This could explain the low

results: (1) predicted impact parameters between the damped absorption system

absorption are generally fainter than m_R = 25 and damped Lyman alpha systems

investigated. It is characterized by self-gravity, structure, and shock
condition at the surfaces of the compressed layer. At one side of the shocked
layer, its surface condition is determined via the ram pressure, while at the
other side the thermal pressure supports its structure. When the ram pressure
dominates the thermal pressure, we expect deceleration of the shocked layer.
Especially, in this paper, we examine how the stratification of the
decelerating layer has an effect on its dynamical stability. Performing the
linear perturbation analysis, a {\it more general} dispersion relation than the
previous one obtained by one of the authors is derived. It gives us an
interesting information about the stability of the decelerating layer.
Importantly, the DSI (Decelerating Shock Instability) and the gravitational
instability are always incompatible. We also consider the evolution effect of
the shocked layer. In the early stages of its evolution, only DSI occurs. On
the contrary, in the late stages, it is possible for the shocked layer to be
unstable for the DSI (in smaller scale) and the gravitational instability (in
larger scale). Furthermore, we find there is a stable range of wavenumbers
against both the DSI and the gravitational instability between respective
unstable wavenumber ranges. These stable modes suggest the ineffectiveness of
DSI for the fragmentation of the decelerating slab.

moving in an antiferromagnet (AF), is studied within a model derived from the

approach is developed which allows one to solve the problem at finite hole
densities in very large systems (of order hundreds of lattice spacings), albeit
in a quasiclassical limit, and to correctly incorporate the long-range part of
the Coulomb interaction. The focus is on the problem of charge ordering and the
charge phase diagram: at low temperatures four different phases are found,
depending on the strength of the magnetic (dipolar) interaction generated by
the spin-wave exchange, and the density of holes. The four phases are the
Wigner crystal, diagonal stripes, a grid phase (horizontal-vertical stripe
loops) and a glassy-clumped phase. In the presence of both in-plane and
out-of-plane charged impurities the stripe ordering is suppressed, although
finite stripe segments persist. At finite temperatures multiscale
(intermittency) dynamics is found, reminiscent of that in glasses. The dynamics
of stripe melting and its implications for experiments is discussed.

double inflation. These models, realistic from a particle physics point of
view, predict a broken-scale-invariant power spectrum of primordial
cosmological perturbations, that may explain eventual non-trivial features in
the present matter power spectrum. In previous works, the primordial spectrum
was calculated using analytic slow-roll approximations. However, these models
involve a fast second-order phase transition during inflation, with a stage of
spinodal instability, and an interruption of slow-roll. For our previous model
of double D-term inflation, we simulate numerically the evolution of quantum
fluctuations, taking into account the spinodal modes, and we show that the
semi-classical approximation can be employed even during the transition, due to
the presence of a second inflaton field. The primordial power spectrum
possesses a rich structure, and possibly, a non-Gaussian spike on observable
scales.

order, the parallel- perpendicular asymmetry in azimuthal distributions of both
charm and bottom quark is predicted to be about 20% in a wide region of initial
energy. Our analysis shows that the next-to-leading order corrections
practically do not affect the Born predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry at
energies of the fixed target experiments. Both leading and next-to-leading
order predictions for the asymmetry are insensitive to within few percent to
theoretical uncertainties in the QCD input parameters: $m_{Q}$, $\mu_{R}$,
$\mu_{F}$, $\Lambda_{QCD}$ and in the gluon distribution function. We estimate
also nonperturbative contributions to azimuthal distributions due to the gluon
transverse motion in the target and the final quark fragmentation. Our
calculations show that nonperturbative corrections to a $B$-meson azimuthal
asymmetry are negligible. We conclude that measurements of the single spin
asymmetry would provide a good test of pQCD applicability to heavy flavor
production at fixed target energies.

approach of hyperspherical harmonics with emphasis on simultaneous, or direct,
emission of two protons. General conditions of direct decays are described and
their main features, being experimentally established in decays of light
nuclei, are reported. The analysis method based on an expansion of decay
amplitude into a series of hyperspherical harmonics is reviewed. The basis of
hyperspherical harmonics functions is a generalisation of the spherical
function basis in three-body systems. The method is tested on analysis of the
direct 2p-decay of Be^6 where the three-body components in the nuclear
structure of Be^6 have been studied. In particular, the observed strong
proton-proton correlations are treated as a manifestation of a specific
three-body quantum effect: the kinematic focusing of fragments over momenta and
in space. The hyperspherical harmonics method is applied for the predictions of
proton-proton correlations and life-time estimates of the nuclei Mg^19, Ca^34
and Ni^48 - candidates for two-proton radioactivity. Each direct 2p-decay
should result in a set of peaks in the E_(p-p) spectrum whose number and
positions depend on the structure of initial nucleus, opposite to the diproton
model, predicting the He^2 emission with one peak at E_(p-p)~0 in all cases.

three-nucleon systems. Pushed by experimental programs at Bates and elsewhere
and facilitated by the rapid growth of computational power, converged solutions

three-nucleon force based on chiral-symmetry considerations was produced. Since
then this symmetry has been our guiding principle in constructing three-nucleon
forces and, more recently, nucleon-nucleon forces. We are finally nearing an
understanding of the common ingredients used in constructing both types of

classical plasma with several species are expressed in terms of a functional
integral over electrostatic potential distributions. The leading order,
field-theoretic tree approximation automatically includes the effects of Debye
screening. Subleading, one-loop corrections are easily evaluated. The two-loop
corrections, however, have ultraviolet divergences. These correspond to the
short-distance, logarithmic divergence which is encountered in the spatial
integral of the Boltzmann exponential when it is expanded to third order in the
Coulomb potential. Such divergences do not appear in the underlying quantum
theory --- they are rendered finite by quantum fluctuations. We show how such
divergences may be removed and the correct finite theory obtained by
introducing additional local interactions in the manner of modern effective
quantum field theories. We obtain explicit results for density-density
correlation functions through two-loop order and thermodynamic quantities
through three-loop order. The induced couplings are shown to obey
renormalization group equations, and these equations are used to characterize
all leading logarithmic contributions in the theory. A linear combination of
pressure and energy and number densities is shown to be described by a
field-theoretic anomaly. The effective theory allows us to evaluate very easily
the algebraic long-distance decay of density correlation functions.

charged particle traversing a plasma entail processes that occur over a wide
range of energy or length scales. Different physical mechanisms dominate at one
or the other end of this range. For example, in the energy loss problem, soft
collisions that are screened by collective effects are important at large
distances, while at short distances hard collisions are important where the
exact details of the single-particle interactions must be taken into account.
We introduce a novel application of dimensional continuation. The soft
processes dominate at all scales when the spatial dimension \nu is less than 3,
and we use them to compute the result to leading order for \nu < 3. On the
other hand, the hard processes dominate at all scales for \nu > 3, and we use
them to compute the result to leading order for these spatial dimensions. We
then explain why the sum of the analytic continuation of these disparate
mechanisms yields the correct leading-order result for the physical limit at
\nu = 3 dimensions. After applying this new method to the energy loss problem
in some detail, we then show how it also provides a very short and easy way to
compute the Lamb shift.

types of elementary interactions in nature; their forms are determined by the
