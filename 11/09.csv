numerous absorptions intrinsic to the target AGN. Here, we describe the details

bremsstrahlung. The importance of Comptonization of synchrotron radiation in
compact X-ray sources is then studied. We consider emission from hot accretion
flows and from active coronae above optically-thick accretion discs in
black-hole binaries and AGNs. Synchrotron Comptonization is found to be, in
general, negligible in luminous sources, except for those with hardest X-ray
spectra and stellar masses. Increasing the black-hole mass results in a strong
reduction of the maximum Eddington ratio possible from to this process. X-ray
spectra of intermediate-luminosity sources, e.g., low-luminosity AGNs, can be
explained by synchrotron Comptonization only in the case of hot accretion
flows. Then, bremsstrahlung emission always dominates X-ray spectra of very
weak sources. Finally, we consider weakly-magnetized neutron stars and find
that synchrotron Comptonization can account for the power-law X-ray spectra

absorbers at significance level >3 sigma in the redshift range z=0.002-0.069,
over a total pathlength of 116,000 km/s. In this second paper, we evaluate the
physical properties of these Lya absorbers and compare them to their high-z
counterparts. The distribution of Doppler parameters is similar to that at high
redshift, with mean b = 35.0 +- 16.6 km/s. The true Doppler parameter may be
somewhat lower, owing to component blends and non-thermal velocities. The
distribution of equivalent widths exhibits a significant break at W~133mA, with
an increasing number of weak absorbers (10mA-100mA). Adopting a curve of growth
with b = 25 +- 5km/s and applying a sensitivity correction as a function of
equivalent width and wavelength, we derive the distribution in column density,
Nh^{-1.72+-0.06} for Nh<10^14 cm^-2. We find no redshift evolution in the

those galaxies with exponential profiles is approximately one magnitude
brighter than the background F814W ""sky"". Thus, with this dataset we recover
Freeman's law and hence know that we do not have a representative sample of
distant galaxies (and neither does anyone else). Classification of the galaxies
was done strictly in structural terms, based only on the form of the derived
luminosity profile. No morphological considerations were made during the
classification process. 23% of the galaxies we detected have the r^{1/4}
profile typical of early type galaxies, matching most previous studies of both
the Hubble Deep Field and the Medium Deep Survey which typically find 15% - 40%
E/S0 galaxies. In agreement with other studies we also found a significant
percentage of galaxies which have disturbed luminosity profiles indicative of
probable galaxy-galaxy interactions or mergers. Indirect indicators suggest
that the volume over which r^{1/4} objects are selected is significantly larger
than the volume over which disk galaxies are selected. This implies a
relatively low space density of r^{1/4} at all redshifts out to z ~ 2.5 and is
consistent with the general idea that r^{1/4} galaxies are largely confined to

flare of April 1998, which was simultaneously observed also at TeV energies.
The detailed study of the flare in different energy bands reveals a few very
important new results: (a) hard photons lag the soft ones by 2-3 ks *a behavior
opposite to what is normally found in High energy peak BL Lacs X-ray spectra*;
(b) the flux decay of the flare can be intrinsically achromatic if a stationary
underlying emission component is present. Moreover the spectral evolution
during the flare has been followed by extracting X-ray spectra on few ks
intervals, allowing to detect for the first time the peak of the synchrotron
component shifting to higher energies during the rising phase, and then
receding. The spectral analysis confirms the delay in the flare at the higher
energies, as above a few keV the spectrum changes only after the peak of the
outburst has occurred. The spectral and temporal information obtained challenge
the simplest models currently adopted for the (synchrotron) emission and most
importantly provide clues on the particle acceleration process. A theoretical
picture accounting for all the observational constraints is discussed, where
electrons are injected at low energies and then progressively accelerated
during the development of the flare.

millisecond pulsars in globular clusters. Our work is motivated by the recent

most neutron stars acquire binary companions through exchange interactions with
primordial binaries. The resulting systems have semimajor axes in the range
\~0.1-1 AU and neutron star companion masses ~1-3 Msun. For many of these
systems we find that, when the companion evolves off the main sequence and
fills its Roche lobe, the subsequent mass transfer is dynamically unstable.
This leads to a common envelope phase and the formation of short-period neutron
star - white dwarf binaries. For a significant fraction of these binaries, the
decay of the orbit due to gravitational radiation will be followed by a period
of stable mass transfer driven by a combination of gravitational radiation and
tidal heating of the companion. The properties of the resulting short-period
binaries match well those of observed binary pulsars in 47 Tuc.

is that the expected GRB energy is sufficiently large, in contrast to the GRB

We argue that such systems are the progenitors of bipolar planetary nebulae and
bipolar symbiotic nebulae with a very narrow equatorial waist between the two
polar lobes. We conduct a population synthesis study of the formation of
planetary nebulae in binary systems which quantitatively supports the proposed
model. We show the number of expected systems that blow a CFW is in accord with

of the 21cm lines to the damped Ly-alpha line is T_s = 775 K, the thermal
kinetic temperatures of the two narrow components, calculated from their
widths, are much lower: T_k \leq 297 and \leq 103 K respectively. This is the
first case of a redshifted absorption system for which T_k is measured to be
less than T_s. We discuss this result in the context of a two phase gas model,
in which the damped Ly-alpha gas is sensitive to a significant neutral column
density of warm phase gas as well as the cold phase gas of the narrow 21cm

calculated. The idealized limit of a well-ordered array of magnetic and charged
stripes is analyzed, including effects of long-range Coulomb repulsion.
Remarkably, down to the limit of two-cell wide stripes, the dispersion can be
interpreted as essentially a superposition of the two end-phase dispersions,
with superposed minigaps associated with the lattice periodicity. The largest
minigap falls near the Fermi level; it can be enhanced by proximity to a (bulk)
Van Hove singularity. The calculated spectra are dominated by two features --
this charge stripe minigap plus the magnetic stripe Hubbard gap. There is a
strong correlation between these two features and the experimental
photoemission results of a two-peak dispersion in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, and
the peak-dip-hump spectra in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$. The
differences are suggestive of the role of increasing stripe fluctuations. The
1/8 anomaly is associated with a quantum critical point, here expressed as a
percolation-like crossover. A model is proposed for the limiting minority

$\Gamma$ given in terms of the first relative homology group of the Lagrangian
Grassmannian; under generic circumstances $\maslov(\Gamma)$ is computed as a
sort of {\em algebraic count} of the $\mathcal P$-focal points along $\Gamma$.
We prove the following version of the Index Theorem: under suitable hypotheses,
the Morse index of the Lagrangian action functional restricted to suitable
variations of $\Gamma$ is equal to the sum of $\maslov(\Gamma)$ and a {\em
convexity term} of the Hamiltonian $H$ relative to the submanifold $\mathcal

Grassmannians and Langlands Duality'', AG/9703010. The main new result is a
topological realization of algebraic representations of reductive groups over
arbitrary rings.
  We outline a proof of a geometric version of the Satake isomorphism. Given a
connected, complex algebraic reductive group G we show that the tensor category
of representations of the Langlands dual group is naturally equivalent to a
certain category of perverse sheaves on the loop Grassmannian of G. The above
result has been announced by Ginsburg in and some of the arguments are borrowed
from his approach. However, we use a more ""natural"" commutativity constraint
for the convolution product, due to Drinfeld. Secondly, we give a direct proof
that the global cohomology functor is exact and decompose this cohomology
functor into a direct sum of weights. The geometry underlying our arguments
leads to a construction of a canonical basis of Weyl modules given by algebraic
cycles and an explicit construction of the group algebra of the dual group in
terms of the affine Grassmannian. We completely avoid the use of the
decomposition theorem which makes our techniques applicable to perverse sheaves
with coefficients over an arbitrary commutative ring. We deduce the classical
Satake isomorphism using the affine Grassmannian defined over a finite field.
This note contains indications of proofs of some of the results. The details
will appear elsewhere.
