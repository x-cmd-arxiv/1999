  Reference added",,"10.1086/301205",,"astro-ph",,"  The dispersion in lithium abundance at fixed effective temperature in young
cool stars like the Pleiades has proved a difficult challenge for stellar
evolution theory. We propose that Li abundances relative to a mean temperature
trend, rather than the absolute abundances, should be used to analyze the
spread in abundance. We present evidence that the dispersion in Li equivalent
widths at fixed color in cool single Pleiades stars is at least partially
caused by stellar atmosphere effects (most likely departures from ionization
predictions of model photospheres) rather than being completely explained by
genuine abundance differences. We find that effective temperature estimates
from different colors yield systematically different values for active stars.
There is also a strong correlation between stellar activity and Li excess, but
not a one-to-one mapping between unprojected stellar rotation (from photometric
periods) and Li excess. Thus, it is unlikely that rotation is the main cause
for the dispersion in the Li abundances. Finally, there is a strong correlation
between detrended Li excess and potassium excess but not calcium-- perhaps
supporting incomplete radiative transfer calculations (and overionization
effects in particular) as an important source of the Li scatter. Other
mechanisms, such as very small metallicity variations and magnetic fields,
which influence PMS Li burning may also play a role. Finally, we find no
statistical evidence for a decrease in dispersion in the coolest Pleiades
stars, contrary to some previous work.

the Whipple and HEGRA collaborations have stimulated efforts to estimate or
limit the spectral energy density (SED) of extragalactic background light (EBL)
which causes attenuation of TeV photons via pair-production when they travel
cosmological distances. In spite of the lack of any distinct cutoff-like
feature in the spectra of Mrk 501 and Mrk 421 (in the interval 0.26-10 TeV)
which could clearly indicate the presence of such a photon absorption
mechanism, we demonstrate that strong EBL attenuation signal (survival
probability of 10 TeV photon (~10^{-2}) may still be present in the spectra of
these AGNs. This attenuation could escape detection due to a special form of
SED of EBL and unknown intrinsic spectra of these blazars. Here we show how the

be able to detect or severely limit the EBL SED by extension of spectral

(dSph) companion to M31. The resulting color-magnitude diagrams reveal the
morphology of the horizontal branch (HB) in this dwarf galaxy. We find that
like Andromeda I, and like most of the Galactic dSph companions, the HB
morphology of And II is predominantly red. Unlike And I, however, there is no
evidence for a radial gradient in HB morphology in the And II data. At least
50% of the total stellar population in And II is younger than the age of the
globular clusters. On the other hand, the existence of blue HB and RR Lyrae
variable stars in And II argues for the existence of an additional old (age >
10 Gyr) population. Thus And II has had an extended epoch of star formation
like many of the Galactic dSphs. Our derived distance confirms the association
of And II with M31, rather than with M33 to which And II lies closer on the
sky. The true distance of And II from the center of M31 is between 160 and 230
kpc. With the current samples of dSph companions, the size of the Galaxy's and
M31's dSph satellite systems are comparable, with outer radii of order 250 kpc.
The And II red giant branch colors yield a mean abundance of <[Fe/H]> = -1.49
+/- 0.11 and a surprisingly large internal abundance spread, which can be
characterized by sigma(int)([Fe/H]) ~ 0.36 dex, considerably larger than that
derived for And I (0.21) from an identical analysis of similar data. Thus
despite having very similar luminosities and mean metal abundances, these two
M31 dSph companions have clearly had different chemical evolution histories. We
conclude that the diversity of evolutionary histories evident among the
Galactic dSph companions is now also firmly established among the dSph
satellites of M31.

angular momentum evolution in evolved stars and therefore rotational mixing on

branch stars, we calculate simple models for the angular momentum evolution of
a globular cluster giant star from the base of the giant branch to the star's
appearance on the horizontal branch. We include mass loss, and infer the
accompanied loss of angular momentum for each of four assumptions about the
internal angular momentum profile. These models are compared to observations of
horizontal branch rotation rates in M13. We find that rapid rotation on the
horizontal branch can be reconciled with slow solid body main sequence rotation
if giant branch stars have differential rotation in their convective envelopes
and a rapidly rotating core, which is then followed by a redistribution of
angular momentum on the horizontal branch. We discuss the physical reasons why
these very different properties relative to the solar case may exist in giants.
Rapid rotation in the core of the main sequence precursors of the rapidly
rotating horizontal branch star, or an angular momentum source on the giant
branch is required for all cases if the rotational velocity of turnoff stars is
less than 4 km s$^{-1}$. We suggest that the observed range in rotation rates
on the horizontal branch is caused by internal angular momentum redistribution
which occurs on a timescale comparable to the evolution of the stars on the
horizontal branch. The apparent lack of rapid horizontal branch rotators hotter
than 12 000 K in M13 could be a consequence of gravitational settling, which
inhibits internal angular momentum transport. Alternative explanations and

the system, i.e., the eigenvalues and the right and left eigenvectors, is
explicitly shown. An alternative approach consists in using any of the special
relativistic Riemann solvers recently developed for describing the evolution of
special relativistic flows. Our proposal relies on a local change of
coordinates in terms of which the spacetime metric is locally Minkowskian and
permits an accurate description of numerical general relativistic
hydrodynamics.

X/N of the electrons, defined appropriately to remain valid for extended
systems obeying twisted boundary conditions. The first moment is the average
polarization, where we recover the well-known Berry phase expression. The
second cumulant gives the mean-square fluctuation of the polarization, which
defines an electronic localization length xi_i along each direction i. It
follows from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem that in the thermodynamic
limit xi_i diverges for metals and is a finite, measurable quantity for
insulators. It is possible to define for insulators maximally-localized
``many-body Wannier functions'', which for large N become localized in
disconnected regions of the high-dimensional configuration space, establishing
a direct connection with Kohn's theory of the insulating state. Interestingly,
the expression for xi_i^2, which involves the second derivative of the

Kohn's formula for the ``Drude weight'' as the second derivative of the energy.

function (p.d.f.) behaves in a manner which is intermediate between Gaussian
and L\'evy laws while the distribution of accelerations is governed by a Cauchy
law. Our study accounts properly for a spectrum of circulations among the
vortices. In the case of real vortices (with a finite core) we show
analytically that the distribution of accelerations makes a smooth transition
from Cauchy (for small fluctuations) to Gaussian (for large fluctuations)
passing probably through an exponential tail. We introduce a function $T(V)$
which gives the typical duration of a velocity fluctuation $V$; we show that
$T(V)$ behaves like $V$ and $V^{-1}$ for weak and large velocities
respectively. These results have a simple physical interpretation in the
nearest neighbor approximation and in Smoluchowski theory concerning the
persistence of fluctuations. We discuss the analogies with respect to the
fluctuations of the gravitational field in stellar systems. As an application
of these results, we determine an approximate expression for the diffusion
coefficient of point vortices. When applied to the context of freely decaying
two-dimensional turbulence, the diffusion becomes anomalous and we establish a
relationship $\nu=1+{\xi\over 2}$ between the exponent of anomalous diffusion
$\nu$ and the exponent $\xi$ which characterizes the decay of the vortex
density. This relation is in good agreement with laboratory experiments and

influence of the magnetic stray field of the dots on the pinning phenomena,
whereas multilayered Co/Pt dots with out-of-plane magnetization are used to
study the magnetic interaction between the flux lines and the magnetic moment
of the dots. For both types of pinning arrays, matching anomalies are observed
in the magnetization curves versus perpendicular applied field at integer and
rational multiples of the first matching field, which correspond to stable flux
configurations in the artificially created pinning potential. By varying the
magnetic domain structure of the Co dots with in-plane magnetization, a clear
influence of the stray field of the dots on the pinning efficiency is found.
For the Co/Pt dots with out-of-plane magnetization, a pronounced field
asymmetry is observed in the magnetization curves when the dots are magnetized
in a perpendicular field prior to the measurement. This asymmetry can be
attributed to the interaction of the out-of-plane magnetic moment of the Co/Pt
dots with the local field of the flux lines and indicates that flux pinning is
stronger when the magnetic moment of the dot and the field of the flux line
have the same polarity.

intensively along experimental and theoretical lines. We review here the sector
of charm radiative decays in this context. The calculation of $D\to V\gamma$,
$D\to \ell^+\ell^-\gamma$ transitions reveals their unequivocal dominance by
long-distance contributions. On the other hand, the beauty-conserving
charm-changing electroweak transition $B_c\to B_u^*\gamma$ is shown to have
unique properties which make it a promising avenue in the search for new
physics. We describe a calculation of short- and long-distance contributions to
this decay which finds them to be of comparable size. The branching ratio of
this decay in the standard model is estimated to be $\simeq 10^{-8}$.

so readily for antiprotons stopping in liquid hydrogen, that it would require

determine whether this reaction can occur from an atomic S state is suggested.
If indeed this reaction is occurring from an atomic S state, then certain

be tested experimentally.

"math/9911022","Hiroshi Sato","Hiroshi Sato","Toward the classification of higher-dimensional toric Fano varieties","36 pages, Latex2e, to appear in Tohoku Math. J",,,,"math.AG",,"  The purpose of this paper is to give basic tools for the classification of
nonsingular toric Fano varieties by means of the notions of primitive
collections and primitive relations due to Batyrev. By using them we can easily
deal with equivariant blow-ups and blow-downs, and get an easy criterion to
determine whether a given nonsingular toric variety is a Fano variety or not.
As applications of these results, we get a toric version of a theorem of Mori,
and can classify, in principle, all nonsingular toric Fano varieties obtained
from a given nonsingular toric Fano variety by finite successions of
equivariant blow-ups and blow-downs through nonsingular toric Fano varieties.
Especially, we get a new method for the classification of nonsingular toric
Fano varieties of dimension at most four. These methods are extended to the
case of Gorenstein toric Fano varieties endowed with natural resolutions of
singularities. Especially, we easily get a new method for the classification of
Gorenstein toric Fano surfaces.

the AdS/CFT correspondence, and have shown that the relevant manifolds have
certain physically desirable properties when the scalar curvature of the
boundary is positive. It is natural to ask whether similar results hold when
the scalar curvature is zero. With this motivation, we study compact scalar
flat manifolds which do not accept a positive scalar curvature metric. We call
these manifolds rigidly scalar-flat. We study this class of manifolds in terms
of special holonomy groups. In particular, we prove that if, in addition, a
rigidly scalar flat manifold $M$ is $Spin$ with $\dim M\geq 5$, then $M$ either
has a finite cyclic fundamental group, or it must be a counter example to
Gromov-Lawson-Rosenberg conjecture.

deformed mononucleus are microscopically formulated with the linear response
theory making use of the width of single particle states and the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem. For the relative motion of the nuclei and for
the degree of freedom describing the neck between the nuclei, we calculate mass
parameters with basis states of the adiabatic and diabatic two-center shell
model. Microscopical mass parameters are found larger than the ones obtained
with the hydrodynamical model and give a strong hindrance for a melting of the
dinuclear system along the internuclear distance into a compound system.
Therefore, the dinuclear system lives a long time enough comparable to the
reaction time for fusion by nucleon transfer. Consequences of this effect for
the complete fusion process are discussed.

treatment of the nucleon removal reactions (gamma, p) and (e, e' p). The
continuum wave function describing the outgoing nucleon is made orthogonal to
the relevant bound states using the Gram-Schmidt procedure. This procedure has
the advantage of preserving the asymptotic character of the continuum wave
function and hence the elastic observables are unaffected. The orthogonality
effects are found to be negligible for (e, e' p) reactions for missing momenta
up to 700 MeV/c. This holds true for both parallel and perpendicular
kinematics. By contrast the orthogonalization of the wave functions appears to
have a more pronounced effect in the case of (gamma, p) reactions. We find that
the orthogonality effect can be significant in this case particularly for large
angles. Polarization of the outgoing protons and photon asymmetry show more
sensitivity than the cross sections. If the orthogonality condition is imposed
solely on this one hole state the effects are usually smaller.

significant reduction of the directed flow in midrapidity range, which can lead
to the development of the antiflow, is found due to the absorption of early
emitted particles by massive spectators (shadowing effect). This effect can
mimic the formation of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). However, in the absorption
scenario the antiflow is stronger for the system of light colliding nuclei than
for the heavy ones, while in the case of the plasma creation the effect should
be opposite.
