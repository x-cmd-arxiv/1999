sources have very similar power spectra, displaying high frequency noise up to
\~200 Hz. For KS1731-260, its power spectrum is dominated by noise at
frequencies below 20 Hz. In addition a quasi-periodic oscillation at 1200 Hz is
detected. The 1-200 keV LS spectra are all consistent with resulting from
thermal Comptonization with an electron temperature (kTe) around 25-30 keV. For
KS1731-260, the spectrum is also dominated by Comptonization, but with kTe
around 3 keV and no significant hard X-ray emission. With the exception of
GS1826-238, there is an underlying soft component. For all sources, we have
detected an iron line at 6.4 keV. A reflection component is present in the

of main energy release, where hard X-rays are produced would be an optically
thin boundary layer merged with an Advection Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF).
The soft component observed probably represents the unscattered emission from
the accretion disk of variable inner radius. When the accretion rate increases,
the inner disk radius shrinks, the strength of the reflected component and
associated iron line increase, and the Comptonization region cools off in
response to an increased cooling flux from the accretion disk and from the
reprocessed/reflected component. Finally, in the light of these observations,
we discuss extensively the various criteria recently proposed to distinguish
between non-quiescent accreting black holes and neutron stars.

latter can be interpreted in two ways: either as maps of the column density's
spatial distribution (at a given line-of-sight (LOS) velocity), or as maps of
the spatial distribution of a given value of the LOS velocity (weighted by
density). This ambivalence appears related to the fact that the spatial and PPV
representations of the data give significantly different views. First, the
morphology in the channel maps more closely resembles that of the spatial
distribution of the LOS velocity component than that of the density field, as
measured by pixel-to-pixel correlations between images. Second, the channel
maps contain more small-scale structure than 3D slices of the density and
velocity fields, a fact evident both in subjective appearance and in the power
spectra of the images. This effect may be due to a pseudo-random sampling
(along the LOS) of the gas contributing to the structure in a channel map: the
positions sampled along the LOS (chosen by their LOS velocity) may vary
significantly from one position in the channel map to the next.

231, the upper limit on the diameter of the 12.5 $\mu$m source, 0.13$''$, shows
that the size of the infrared source must increase with increasing wavelength,

strong evidence that the source size increases with increasing wavelength. This

a heating rate per unit volume proportional to n_e^2, there is another source
of heat with a rate per unit volume proportional to a lower power of n_e. One
possible mechanism is the dissipation of interstellar plasma turbulence, which
according to Minter & Spangler (1997) heats the ionized interstellar medium in
the Milky Way at a rate ~ 1x10^-25 n_e ergs cm^-3 s^-1. If such a source were

symmetric mass ejection in the supernovae (SNe) which formed the black holes in

  Assuming symmetric mass ejection in black hole formation, we estimate the
amount of mass that must have been ejected in the stellar core collapse in
order to explain the velocities of the above X-ray binaries. We find that at

a minimal model that accounts for both the thermal motion of the constituents

as well as particle-particle repulsion which suppresses density fluctuations. A
correlation function involving fluctuations of the amorphous solid order
parameter, the behavior of which signals the vulcanization transition, is
examined, its physical meaning is elucidated, and the associated susceptibility
is constructed and analyzed. A Ginzburg criterion for the width (in crosslink
density) of the critical region is derived and is found to be consistent with a
prediction due to de Gennes. Certain universal critical exponents
characterizing the vulcanization transition are computed, to lowest nontrivial
order, within the framework of an expansion around the upper critical dimension
of six. This expansion shows that the connection between vulcanization and
percolation extends beyond mean-field theory, at least to first order in the
departure from the upper critical dimension. The relationship between the
present approach to vulcanized matter and other approaches is explored in the

Here we explore pseudospectral collocation (PSC) as an alternative to finite
differencing, focusing particularly on the solution of the Hamiltonian
constraint (an elliptic partial differential equation) for a black hole
spacetime with angular momentum and for a black hole spacetime superposed with
gravitational radiation. In PSC, an approximate solution, generally expressed
as a sum over a set of orthogonal basis functions (e.g., Chebyshev
polynomials), is substituted into the exact system of equations and the
residual minimized. For systems with analytic solutions the approximate
solutions converge upon the exact solution exponentially as the number of basis
functions is increased. Consequently, PSC has a high computational efficiency:
for solutions of even modest accuracy we find that PSC is substantially more
efficient, as measured by either execution time or memory required, than finite
differencing; furthermore, these savings increase rapidly with increasing
accuracy. The solution provided by PSC is an analytic function given
everywhere; consequently, no interpolation operators need to be defined to
determine the function values at intermediate points and no special
arrangements need to be made to evaluate the solution or its derivatives on the
boundaries. Since the practice of numerical relativity by finite differencing
has been, and continues to be, hampered by both high computational resource
demands and the difficulty of formulating acceptable finite difference
alternatives to the analytic boundary conditions, PSC should be further pursued
as an alternative way of formulating the computational problem of finding
numerical solutions to the field equations of general relativity.

incorporate it, opening the possibility of testing nu-anomalies at high- energy
colliders such as the LHC or at the upcoming long-baseline or nu- factory
experiments. Reconciling, in addition, the LSND hint requires a fourth, light
sterile neutrino, nus. The simplest are the most symmetric scenarios, in which
2 of the 4 neutrinos are maximally-mixed and lie at the LSND scale, while the
others are at the solar scale. The lightness of nus, the nearly maximal
atmospheric mixing, and the solar/atmospheric splittings all follow naturally
from the assumed lepton-number symmetry and its breaking. These basic schemes
can be distinguished at neutral-current-sensitive solar & atmospheric neutrino
experiments such as SNO. However underground experiments have not yet proven
neutrino masses, as there are many alternatives. For example flavour changing
interactions can play an important role in the explanation of solar and
contained atmospheric data and could be tested e.g through \mu \to e + \gamma,
\mu-e conversion in nuclei, unaccompanied by neutrino-less double beta decay.
Conversely, a short-lived numu might play a role in the explanation of the
atmospheric data. Finally, in the presence of a nus, a long-lived heavy nutau
could delay the time at which the matter and radiation contributions to the
energy density of the Universe become equal, reducing density fluctuations on
smaller scales, thus saving the standard CDM scenario, while the light nue,
numu and nus would explain the solar & atmospheric data.

space-time structure of relativistic particles. The string is a limiting case
of a series of massive beads like a pearl necklace. In the limit of
infinite-number of zero-mass beads, it becomes a field-theoretic string.
Another interesting limit is to keep only two pearls by eliminating all others,
resulting in a harmonic oscillator. The basic strength of the oscillator model
is its mathematical simplicity. This encourages us to construct two-pearl
strings for a covariant picture of relativistic extended particles. We achieve
this goal by transforming the oscillator model of Feynman {\it et al.} into a
representation of the Poincar\'e group. We then construct representations of
the O(3)-like little group for those oscillator states, which dictates their
internal space-time symmetry of massive particles. This simple mathematical
procedure allows us to explain what we observe in the world in terms of the
fundamental space-time symmetries, and the built-in covariance of the model
allows us to use the physics in the rest frame in order to explain what happens
in the infinite-momentum frame. It is thus possible to calculate the parton
distribution within the proton moving light-like speed in terms of the quark
wave function in its rest frame.

geometric properties of inside-hadron space. Confinement of quarks is ensured
by closed effective (Riemannian) space. Interquark potential represents itself
Coulomb's low in the effective space (Poisson equation). In the framework of
such approach the quarks dynamics completely is defined only by metric of the
effective space, which in turn in conformally-Euclidean case (we consider) is
defined by sole phenomenological function. Also it is supposed, that
inside-hadron vacuum is essential nonperturbative one both on large and on
small distances and this is taken into account by special parameter in the
metric of effective space. For final Schr\""odinger equation the exact
analytical solutions for nonrelativistic energy spectrum and wave functions of

model and under the perturbation theory the spin-dependent relativistic

entanglement of unknown two-qubit pure states and of the degree of mixing of
unknown single-qubit mixed states, of which N identical copies are available.
The most general measuring strategies are considered in both situations, to
conclude in the first case that a local, although collective, measurement
suffices to estimate entanglement, a non-local property, optimally.

prior probabilities p_j respectively. We show that it is possible to increase
all of the pairwise overlaps |<\psi_i|\psi_j>| i.e. make each constituent pair
of the states more parallel (while keeping the prior probabilities the same),
in such a way that the von Neumann entropy S is increased, and dually, make all
pairs more orthogonal while decreasing S. We show that this phenomenon cannot
occur for ensembles in two dimensions but that it is a feature of almost all
ensembles of three states in three dimensions. It is known that the von Neumann
entropy characterises the classical and quantum information capacities of the
ensemble and we argue that information capacity in turn, is a manifestation of
the distinguishability of the signal states. Hence our result shows that the
notion of distinguishability within an ensemble is a global property that
cannot be reduced to considering distinguishability of each constituent pair of
states.
