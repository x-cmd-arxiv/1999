source of emission is unresolved even at the near-infrared resolution of about
0.2 arcsec FWHM which corresponds to about 7 pc at the distance of the galaxy.
This is consistent with the source of emission being the region in the
neighborhood of the purported 3.5*10^7 M_sun black hole. After correcting for
about 18 mags of visual extinction, the infrared data are consistent with a
F_nu \propto nu^(-1.4+/-0.1) spectrum from 1.1 micron to 18 micron, implying a
non-thermal origin. Based on this spectrum, the total extinction corrected
infrared luminosity (1-20 micron) of the central source is 2*10^8 L_sun. We
argue that the infrared spectrum and luminosity of the central source obviates
the need for a substantial contribution from a standard, thin accretion disk at
these wavelengths and calculate the accretion rate through an advection
dominated accretion flow to be Mdot \sim 10^(-3) M_sun/yr. The agreement
between these observations and the theoretical spectral energy distribution for
advection dominated flows provides evidence for the existence of an advection
dominated flow in this low luminosity AGN.

their temperature depends on the cross-sections projected in the direction of
the anisotropy.It was shown that the temperature difference produces polarized
thermal emission even without alignment, if the observer looks at the grains
from a direction different from the anisotropic radiation. When the dust grains
are aligned, the anisotropy in the radiation makes various effects on the
polarization of the thermal emission, depending on the relative angle between
the anisotropy and alignment directions. If the both directions are parallel,
the anisotropy produces a steep increase in the polarization degree at short
wavelengths. If they are perpendicular, the polarization reversal occurs at a
wavelength shorter than the emission peak. The effect of the anisotropic
radiation will make a change of more than a few % in the polarization degree
for short wavelengths and the effect must be taken into account in the
interpretation of the polarization in the thermal emission. The anisotropy in
the radiation field produces a strong spectral dependence of the polarization
degree and position angle, which is not seen under isotropic radiation. The
dependence changes with the grain shape to a detectable level and thus it will
provide a new tool to investigate the shape of dust grains. This paper presents
examples of numerical calculations of the effects and demonstrates the
importance of anisotropic radiation field on the polarized thermal emission.

Milky Way value, its [C~I] to CO intensity ratio is I([CI])/I(CO)~18 is similar
(only about 50% larger) to that of the Milky Way. Modelling of the [CII]/CO and
[CI]/CO intensity ratios with metallicity indicates that, if C+ and C are
chiefly produced by UV photodissociation, both ratios should increase sharply
with decreasing metallicity (and consequently diminished UV shielding; Bolatto,
Jackson, and Ingalls 1999). These data then suggest a different origin for an
important fraction of C in these clouds, unrelated to photodissociation. We
have also mapped the 850 um continuum in this region using SCUBA. Employing
these data in conjunction with KAO and IRAM measurements we find an extremely
low emissivity exponent, b~0.5. We conclude that this low exponent is most
likely due to the destruction of small dust grains, brought about by the
increased penetration of UV radiation in the low metallicity ISM. If a low b in
the submillimeter is a general property of metal-poor systems then the
interpretation of millimeter and submillimeter surveys of high-z galaxies

show that the structure is described by a partially destroyed tetrahedral SiO_4

the diffusion of the ions in the sodium silicate systems with that in pure

characterized by an activated hopping through the Si-O matrix which is frozen
with respect to the movement of the sodium atoms. We identify the elementary

control-parameter like pressure or chemical composition is changed. They are
driven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations. In this review we first
give a pedagogical introduction to quantum phase transitions and quantum
critical behavior emphasizing similarities with and differences to classical
thermal phase transitions. We then illustrate the general concepts by
discussing a few examples of quantum phase transitions occurring in electronic
systems. The ferromagnetic transition of itinerant electrons shows a very rich
behavior since the magnetization couples to additional electronic soft modes
which generates an effective long-range interaction between the spin
fluctuations. We then consider the influence of rare regions on quantum phase
transitions in systems with quenched disorder, taking the antiferromagnetic
transitions of itinerant electrons as a primary example. Finally we discuss
some aspects of the metal-insulator transition in the presence of quenched
disorder and interactions.

Sarmiento defined the vacuum stress-energy tensor with respect to the

the flux to synchrotron radiation. In order to investigate the relation between
the vacuum stress and bremsstrahlung, we estimate the stress-energy tensor of
the electromagnetic field generated by a point charge, at the position of the
charge. We use the retarded field as a self-field of the point charge.
Therefore the tensor diverges if we evaluate it as it is. Hence we remove the
divergent contributions by using the expansion of the tensor in powers of the
distance from the point charge. Finally, we take an average for the angular
dependence of the expansion. We calculate it for the case of uniform
acceleration and circular motion, and it is found that the order of the vacuum
stress multiplied by $\pi\alpha$ ($\alpha=e^2/\hbar c$ is the fine structure
constant) is equal to that of the self-stress. In the Appendix, we give another
trial approach with a similar result.

measurement. All measured properites of the luminosity event sample are found
to be in agreement with current theoretical expectations. The total systematic

that contain a pitchfork as an organizing centre. Comparison of these surfaces
shows that notionally equivalent problems can have significant positional
differences in their bifurcation behaviour. As a consequence, the parameter
range of jump, hysteresis, or phase transition phenomena in dynamical models
(and the physical systems they purport to represent) is determined by other
singularities that shape the limit-point shell.

Tate constructed a nondegenerate pairing \Sha(A)_\nd \times \Sha(A)_\nd
\rightarrow \Q/\Z. If A is an elliptic curve, then by a result of Cassels the
pairing is alternating. But in general it is only antisymmetric.
  Using some new but equivalent definitions of the pairing, we derive general
criteria deciding whether it is alternating and whether there exists some
alternating nondegenerate pairing on \Sha(A)_\nd. These criteria are expressed
in terms of an element c \in \Sha(A)_\nd that is canonically associated to the
polarization \lambda. In the case that A is the Jacobian of some curve, a
down-to-earth version of the result allows us to determine effectively whether
\#\Sha(A) (if finite) is a square or twice a square. We then apply this to
prove that a positive proportion (in some precise sense) of all hyperelliptic
curves of even genus g \ge 2 over \Q have a Jacobian with nonsquare \#\Sha (if
finite). For example, it appears that this density is about 13% for curves of

reaction has been extracted for the 161,162-Dy and 171,172-Yb nuclei. The
energy shift between the level densities of the even-odd and even-even isotopes
is measured as a function of excitation energy. The results are compared with
predictions from various semi-empirical models. The energy shift procedure
works well for excitation energies between 3.5 and 7 MeV in the even-even
nucleus, provided that a proper level density function is used. The
experimental energy shift is close to the pairing gap parameter Delta.

investigated for two different values of the chemical potential $\mu$ starting
from the separable form of the Paris NN-potential. It is shown that, within a
high accuracy, this effective interaction can be approximated by the off-shell
free T-matrix taken at the negative energy $E=2\mu$.

results as an approximation to the relativistic Faddeev equation for three
quarks which yields an effective Bethe-Salpeter equation. Octet and decuplet
masses and fully four-dimensional wave functions have been computed for two
cases: assuming an essentially pointlike diquark on the one hand, and a diquark
with internal structure on the other hand. Whereas the differences in the mass
spectrum are fairly small, the nucleon electromagnetic form factors are greatly
improved assuming a diquark with structure. First calculations to the
pion-nucleon form factor also suggest improvements.

the continuum electron into an atomic bound state generally is accompanied by
absorption or emission of several laser quanta. The spectrum of emitted photons
represents an equidistant pattern with the spacing equal to the laser
frequency. The distribution of intensities in this spectrum is studied
employing the Keldysh-type approximation, i.e. neglecting interaction of the
impact electron with the atomic core in the initial continuum state. Within the
adiabatic approximation the scale of emitted photon frequencies is subdivided
into classically allowed and classically forbidden domains. The highest
intensities correspond to emission frequencies close to the edges of
classically allowed domain. The total cross section of electron recombination
summed over all emitted photon channels exhibits negligible dependence on the
laser field intensity.
