enrichment of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the halo. Contrary to 1-zone
chemical evolution models, we are able to resolve local inhomogeneities in the
ISM caused by single core-collapse supernovae. These inhomogeneities lead to
different element abundance patterns in very metal-poor stars, which can be
seen as scatter in the abundances of halo stars with metallicities [Fe/H] <
2.0. The early chemical evolution of the halo proceeds in different enrichment
phases: At [Fe/H] < -3.0, the halo ISM is unmixed and dominated by local
inhomogeneities caused by single core-collapse supernova (SN) events. For
metallicities [Fe/H] >-2.0 the halo ISM is well mixed, showing an element
abundance pattern integrated over the initial mass function. In the range -3.0
< [Fe/H] < -2.0 a continuous transition from the unmixed to the well mixed ISM
occurs. For some elements (Si, Ca, Eu), the scatter in the element-to-iron
ratio [El/Fe] seen in the observations of metal-poor halo stars can be
reproduced. Stellar yields of other elements predict a scatter which, compared
to the observations, is too large (O, Mg) or too small (Ni). Cr and Mn show a
decreasing trend for lower metallicities, which can not be explained by
metallicity independent yields, provided that the mixing of the ejecta with the
interstellar medium does not depend on progenitor mass. This demonstrates the
need for revised, self-consistent core-collapse SN yields.

invert the equation of stellar statistics for the Galactic bulge and is then
applied to the K-band star counts from the Two-Micron Galactic Survey in a
number of off-plane regions (10 deg.>|b|>2 deg., |l|<15 deg.).
  The top end of the K-band luminosity function is derived and the morphology
of the stellar density function is fitted to triaxial ellipsoids, assuming a
non-variable luminosity function within the bulge. The results, which have
already been outlined by Lopez-Corredoira et al.(1997, MNRAS 292, L15), are
shown in this paper with a full explanation of the steps of the inversion: the
luminosity function shows a sharp decrease brighter than M_K=-8.0 mag when
compared with the disc population; the bulge fits triaxial ellipsoids with the
major axis in the Galactic plane at an angle with the line of sight to the
Galactic centre of 12 deg. in the first quadrant; the axial ratios are
1:0.54:0.33, and the distance of the Sun from the centre of the triaxial
ellipsoid is 7860 pc. The major-minor axial ratio of the ellipsoids is found
not to be constant. However, the interpretation of this is controversial. An
eccentricity of the true density-ellipsoid gradient and a population gradient
are two possible explanations.
  The best fit for the stellar density, for 1300 pc<t<3000 pc, are calculated
for both cases, assuming an ellipsoidal distribution with constant axial
ratios, and when K_z is allowed to vary. From these, the total number of bulge
stars is ~ 3 10^{10} or ~ 4 10^{10}, respectively.

systems, chosen from a parent sample of optically-selected interacting
galaxies. The sample observed here spans a large range of interaction strengths
and star formation rates (SFR). Using the standard CO-to-H2 conversion factor
we find that the interacting galaxies are, on average, marginally more rich in
molecular gas than a comparison sample of isolated spiral galaxies, having mean
H2/LB and H2/HI ratios 20-40% higher than isolated spirals. The interacting
galaxies also have a mean LIR/MH2 ratio that is a factor of ~1.3 higher than
the isolated galaxies. There is a strong correlation between relative H2
content and SFRs, indicating that the level of interaction-induced star
formation activity is very dependent upon the the available gas supply. Some
galaxies, however, have moderate amounts of H2 but much lower than normal SFRs.
Therefore molecular gas is a necessary, but not sufficient, prerequisite for
star formation. There is also a strong correlation between interaction strength
and both SFR and relative H2 content. If the increase in H2 content is real,
there must be a substantial conversion of HI to H2 gas taking place in the
strongest interacting systems. At least some portion of this apparent increase,
however, could be due to non-standard CO-to-H2 conversion factors. A reduction
in the conversion factor by amounts consistent with that applicable to
ultraluminous infrared galaxies would completely account for the systematic
increase in derived H2 content as a function of interaction strength. Such a
change could not, however, account for the total range of relative H2 content
as a function of SFR. Therefore the correlation between molecular gas content
and star formation rate must be real.

technique described in Majewski et al. (1999) to identify giant star candidates
at the distance and metallicity of Carina across the entire extent of the
photometric survey covering some 2.2 deg^2 on and around Carina. These
Carina-associated giant candidates are identified by a combination of (1) their

distribution of the extratidal giant candidates is similar to that found from
previous statistical star-counting approaches. However, we are now able to
pinpoint actual, remotely-situated Carina stars individually. Because we can
exclude foreground dwarf stars, our approach allows greater sensitivity and the
ability to map the detailed two-dimensional distribution of extended Carina
populations to much larger radii, with smaller aperture telescopes, than other
techniques. Moreover, we identify candidate lists of widely displaced
Carina-associated stars bright enough for spectroscopic studies of large-scale
dynamical and metallicity properties of the system, and for astrometric study
by SIM. We obtained spectroscopy for three such ``extratidal'' stars and from

hydrodynamics along with the Einstein field equations, a qualitative study of
the early stages on inspiral can be accomplished by either Newtonian or
post-Newtonian models, which are more tractable. In this paper we offer a
comparison of results from both rotating and non-rotating (inertial) frame
Newtonian calculations. We find that the rotating frame calculations offer
significantly improved accuracy as compared with the inertial frame models.
Furthermore, we show that inertial frame models exhibit significant and
erroneous angular momentum loss during the simulations that leads to an
unphysical inspiral of the two neutron stars. We also examine the dependence of
the models on initial conditions by considering initial configurations that
consist of spherical neutron stars as well as stars that are in equilibrium and
which are tidally distorted. We compare our models those of Rasio & Shapiro

observed with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 on board the Hubble Space
Telescope. Two photometric procedures, based on the DoPHOT and DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME
programs are tested, and the effects of crowding, complex sky background and
cosmic-ray contamination are discussed using an extensive set of artificial
star simulations. As a specific application of the results presented in this
paper, we assess the magnitude of photometric biases on programs aimed at
finding Cepheids and determining distances. We find that while the photometry
in individual images can be biased too bright by up to 0.2 mag in the most
crowded fields due to confusion noise, the effects on distance measurements
based on Cepheid variables are insignificant, less than 0.02 mag (1% in
distance) even in the most problematic cases. This result, which is at odds
with claims recently surfaced in the literature, is due to the strict criteria
applied in the selection of the variable stars, and the photometric cross
checks made possible by the availability of multiple exposures in different
filters which characterizes Cepheid observations.

sources closer to the Galactic Plane to be more likely to vary, which suggests
that the variability is a result of refractive scintillation in the Galactic
interstellar medium. The sources with the flattest radio spectra show the
highest levels of variability, an effect possibly resulting from differing
orientations of the radio axes to the line of sight.

  The spectral energy distributions of the radio- and optically-selected
sources are quite different. The optically selected QSOs are all very similar:
they have blue spectral energy distributions curving downwards at shorter
wavelengths. Roughly 90% of the radio-selected quasars have roughly power-law
spectral energy distributions, with slopes ranging from Fnu=nu^0 to Fnu=nu^-2.
The remaining 10% have spectral energy distributions showing sharp peaks: these
are radio galaxies and highly reddened quasars.
  Four radio sources were not detected down to magnitude limits of H ~ 19.6.
These are probably high redshift (z >3) galaxies or quasars.
  We show that the colours of our red quasars lie close to the stellar locus in
the optical: they will be hard to identify in surveys such as the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. If near-IR photometry is added, however, the red power-law sources
can be clearly separated from the stellar locus: IR surveys such as 2MASS
should be capable of finding these sources on the basis of their excess flux in
the K-band.

results are presented in tabular form, with full error covariance matrices to
allow for comparisons with any numerical simulations and with other data sets.
The observations are compared with a numerical simulation of the \lya forest of
a Lambda-CDM model with Omega=0.4, known to agree with other large-scale
structure observational constraints. There is excellent agreement for the PDF,
if the mean transmitted flux is adjusted to match the observations. A small
difference between the observed and predicted PDF is found at high fluxes and
low redshift, which may be due to the uncertain effects of fitting the spectral
continuum. Using the numerical simulation, we show how the flux power spectrum
can be used to recover the initial power spectrum of density fluctuations. From
our sample of eight quasars, we measure the amplitude of the mass power
spectrum to correspond to a linear variance per unit ln(k) of
$\Delta^2_\rho(k)=0.72\pm0.09$ at k=0.04(km/s)^{-1} and z=3, and the slope of
the power spectrum near the same k to be $n_p=-2.55\pm0.10$ (statistical error
bars). The results are statistically consistent with Croft et. al. (1999),
although our value for the rms fluctuation is lower by a factor 0.75. For the

model, the angular spectrum of the CMB can be computed to percent accuracy. On
the observational side, as far as we know, there is little that stands in the
way between an accurate measurement and a rigorous confrontation with theory.
In this article, we review the state of the data and indicate future
directions.
  The data clearly show a rise in the angular spectrum to a peak of roughly
$\delta T_l=(l(l+1)C_l/2\pi)^{1/2}\approx 85~\mu$K at $l\approx 200$ and a fall
at higher $l$. In particular, $\delta T_l$ at $l=400$ is significantly less
than at $l=200$. This is shown by a combined analysis of data sets and by the
TOCO data alone.
  In the simplest open models with $\Omega_m = 0.35$, one expects a peak in the
angular spectrum near $l=400$. For spatially flat models, a peak near $l=200$
is indicated and thus this model is preferred by the data. The combination of
this, along with the growing body of evidence that $\Omega_m \approx 0.3$,
suggests a cosmological constant is required. Further evidence for a
cosmological constant is provided by the height of the peak. This conclusion is
independent of the supernovae data.

model, we have updated constraints on the explosion energy and the extent of
mixing in the ejecta. In particular, we determine the most likely range of E/M

general, our best models have energies in the range E = (1.1 +/- 0.3) x 10^{51}
ergs, and the agreement is better than in earlier, flux-limited diffusion
calculations for the same explosion energy. Our modeled B and V fluxes compare
well with observations, while the flux in U undershoots after about 10 days by
a factor of a few, presumably due to NLTE and line transfer effects. We also
compare our results with IUE observations, and a very good quantitative
agreement is found for the first days, and for one IUE band (2500-3000 A) as

the system to be a non-Fermi liquid as conjectured by Anderson on a general
ground. But this phase shift also drastically changes a conventional perception
of quasiparticles in a spin-charge separation state: an injected hole will
remain {\em stable} due to the confinement of spinon and holon by the phase
shift field despite the background is a spinon-holon sea. True {\em

will lose its integrity and decay into holon and spinon elementary excitations.
The Fermi surface structure is completely different in these two cases, from a
large band-structure-like one to four Fermi points in one-hole case, and we
argue that the so-called underdoped regime actually corresponds to a situation
in between, where the ``gap-like'' effect is amplified further by a microscopic
phase separation at low temperature. Unique properties of the single-electron
propagator in both normal and superconducting states are studied by using the

the introduction of permanent random constraints between the constituents of a

random constraints, this phase transition is an equilibrium transition, which
confers on it a simplicity (at least relative to the conventional glass

equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this Paper I shall review recent

extensions, RH currents appear at higher energy scales. At those energies the
RH rotations are not irrelevant any more, they can affect neutrino
oscillations, proton decay, baryon assymetry, R-parity violating interactions

interesting not only because large mixing induce large effects. They are
intimately related to large lepton mixing in GUTs, via a relation between LH
mixing of the leptons and the RH ones of the d-quarks ,(``$d - \ell$ duality'')

It is emphasized that Matrix Theory is a valid Discrete Light Cone Quantization
of M Theory with at least 6 noncompact asymptotically flat dimensions and 16 or
32 Supersymmetry Charges. The background dependence of the quantum mechanics of
M Theory, and the necessity of working in light cone frame in asymptotically
flat spacetimes are explained in terms of the asymptotic density of states of
the theory, which follows from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. In four
noncompact dimensions one is led to expect a Hagedorn spectrum in light cone
energy. This suggests the possible relevance of ``little string theories''
(LSTs) to the quantum description of four dimensional compactifications,
because one can argue that their exact high energy spectrum has the Hagedorn
form. Some space is therefore devoted to a discussion of the properties of
LSTs, which were first discovered as the proper formulation of Matrix Theory on
the five torus.

\sqrt{A} /(2\sqrt{pi}), where `A' is its area. We first consider the charged
Kerr black hole. For such a spacetime, we calculate the quasilocal energy
within a two-surface of constant Boyer-Lindquist radius embedded in a constant
stationary-time slice. Keeping with Martinez's conjecture, at the outer horizon
this energy equals the irreducible mass. The energy is positive and
monotonically decreases to the ADM mass as the boundary-surface radius
diverges. Next we perform an analogous calculation for the quasilocal energy
for the Kerr-Sen spacetime, which corresponds to four-dimensional rotating
charged black hole solutions in heterotic string theory. The behavior of this
energy as a function of the boundary-surface radius is similar to the charged
Kerr case. However, we show that in this case it does not approach the
expression conjectured by Martinez at the horizon.

distinct scenarios, one in which the additional scalars are light and another
in which they are heavier than half the Z-boson mass. It is shown that
asymptotic freedom is obtained without requiring that all additional couplings
keep fixed ratios with each other. It is also shown that both scenarios can not
be ruled out by what are considered standard tests of QCD like R- parameter,
g-2 for muons or deep inelastic phenomena. The light mass scenario is however
ruled out by high precision Z-width data (and only by that one data).The heavy
mass scenario is still viable and is shown to naturally pass the test of
flavour changing neutral currents. It also is not ruled out by precision
electroweak oblique parameters. Many distinctive experimental signatures of
these models are also discussed.

Considering the model of 2D QED, both Weyl and chiral anomalies are directly
obtained from the effective action. The mass and wave function renormalization
are explicitly performed in 4D QED. We confirm the multiplicative (not

solutions are found, corresponding to different non-commuting Hamiltonians.
Their energy eigenstates are labeled with the main quantum number n and parity

correspond to different boundary conditions: (I) the wave function vanishes on
the boundary, (II) the derivative of the wavefunction vanishes on the

boundary conditions. By using projection operators, confinement of the particle
