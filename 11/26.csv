opinion formation process. It is assumed that individuals in community create a
two-component communication field that influences the change of opinions of
other persons and/or can induce their migration. The communication field is
described by a reaction-diffusion equation, the opinion change of the
individuals is given by a master equation, while the migration is described by
a set of Langevin equations, coupled by the communication field. In the
mean-field limit holding for fast communication we derive a critical population
size, above which the community separates into a majority and a minority with
opposite opinions. The existence of external support (e.g. from mass media)
changes the ratio between minority and majority, until above a critical
external support the supported subpopulation exists always as a majority.
Spatial effects lead to two critical ``social'' temperatures, between which the
community exists in a metastable state, thus fluctuations below a certain
critical wave number may result in a spatial opinion separation. The range of
metastability is particularly determined by a parameter characterizing the
individual response to the communication field. In our discussion, we draw
analogies to phase transitions in physical systems.

  Minor changes",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We show that young pulsars with normal magnetic fields, which are born as
fast rotating neutron stars (NSs) in Type II/Ib supernova explosions, can slow
down quickly by relativistic particles emission along their magnetic axis. When
they slow down sufficiently, they can undergo phase transitions and collapse to
strange stars, quark stars or black holes in explosions that remove a
substantial fraction of their initial angular momentum. The newly born strange
or quark stars continue to cool and spin down very quickly as soft gamma ray
repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) to become slowly rotating,
radio-quiet, dim X-ray pulsars or stellar black holes, depending on their
initial mass. It can explain the apparent dearth of young radio pulsars in SNRs
and in the Galaxy.

known AGN in the local (z<0.3) Universe, the recently discovered quasar PDS
456. Multiwavelength observations have been conducted which show that PDS 456
has a bolometric luminosity of 10^47 erg/s peaking in the UV part of the
spectrum. In the X-ray band the 2-10 keV (rest-frame) luminosity is 10^45
erg/s. The broad-band X-ray spectrum obtained with ASCA and RXTE contains
considerable complexity. The most striking feature observed is a very deep,
ionised iron K edge, observed at 8.7 keV in the quasar rest-frame. We find that
these features are consistent with reprocessing from highly ionised matter,
probably the inner accretion disk. PDS 456 appeared to show a strong (factor of
2.1) outburst in just 17ksec, although non-intrinsic sources cannot be
completely ruled out. If confirmed, this would be an unusual event for such a
high-luminosity source, with the light-crossing-time corresponding to 2
Schwarzschild radii. The implication would be that flaring occurs within the
very central regions, or else that PDS 456 is a `super-Eddington' or
relativistically beamed system. Overall we conclude on the basis of the extreme
blue/UV luminosity, the rapid X-ray variability and from the imprint of highly
ionised material on the X-ray spectrum, that PDS 456 is a quasar with an
unusually high accretion rate.

(AGN). Spectrophotometry was obtained every 1-4 months for 7.5 years, yielding
20-70 observing epochs per object. Both the continuum and emission line fluxes
of all of the quasars were observed to change during the duration of the
observing program. Seventeen of the 28 objects were observed with adequate
sampling to search for correlated variations between the Balmer emission lines
and the continuum flux. For each of these 17 objects, a significant correlation
was observed, with the Balmer line variations lagging those of the continuum by
\~100 days (rest frame). Our work increases the available luminosity range for
studying the size-mass-luminosity relations in AGN by two orders of magnitude
and doubles the number of objects suitable for such studies. Combining our
results with comparable published data available for Seyfert 1 galaxies, we
find the BLR size scales with the rest-frame 5100 A luminosity as
L^{0.70+-0.03}. This determination of the scaling of the size of the BLR as a
function of luminosity is significantly different from those previously
published, and suggests that the effective ionization parameter in AGN may be a
decreasing function of luminosity. We are also able to constrain, subject to
our assumption that gravity dominates the motions of the BLR gas, the scaling
relationship between the mass of the central black holes and the luminosity in
AGN: M \propto L^{0.5+-0.1}. This is inconsistent with all AGN having optical
luminosity that is a constant fraction of the Eddington luminosity.

starvation electric fields along the polar magnetic field lines of rotation
powered pulsars, including the effect of dragging of inertial frames which
dominates the acceleration of a space charge limited beam. I apply these
results to a new calculation of the radio pulsar death line, under the
hypotheses that pulsar ``death'' corresponds to cessation of pair creation over
the magnetic poles {\it and} that the magnetic field has a locally dipolar
topology. The frame dragging effect in star centered dipole geometry does
improve comparison of the theory with observation, but an unacceptably large
conflict between observation and theory still persists. Offsetting the dipole
improves the comparison, but a fully satisfactory theory requires incorporating
magnetic conversion of inverse Compton gamma rays, created by scattering
thermal photons from the surface of old neutron stars ($t > 10^8 $ years) kept
warm ($T \geq 10^5$ K) by friction between the rotating core and the crust. The
result is a ``death valley'' for pulsars; offsets of the dipole center from the
stellar center in the oldest stars $\sim (0.7-0.8) R_*$ suffice. The resulting
theory predicted the existence of rotation powered pulsars with these advanced
ages, a prediction confirmed by the recent discovery that PSR J2144-3933
actually has a rotation period of 8.5 seconds.

any harmonic decomposition of the perturbations. We also show how expanding the

log-periodicity are an elaboration of the concept of scale invariance in which
the system is scale invariant only under powers of specific values of the
magnification factor. We report on the discovery of a novel mechanism for such
log-periodicity relying solely on the manipulation of data. This ``synthetic''
scenario for log-periodicity relies on two steps: (1) the fact that
approximately logarithmic sampling in time corresponds to uniform sampling in
the logarithm of time; and (2) a low-pass-filtering step, as occurs in
constructing cumulative functions, in maximum likelihood estimations, and in
de-trending, reddens the noise and, in a finite sample, creates a maximum in
the spectrum leading to a most probable frequency in the logarithm of time. We
explore in detail this mechanism and present extensive numerical simulations.
We use this insight to analyze the 27 best aftershock sequences studied by
Kisslinger and Jones [1991] to search for traces of genuine log-periodic
corrections to Omori's law, which states that the earthquake rate decays
approximately as the inverse of the time since the last main shock. The
observed log-periodicity is shown to almost entirely result from the
``synthetic scenario'' owing to the data analysis. From a statistical point of
view, resolving the issue of the possible existence of log-periodicity in
aftershocks will be very difficult as Omori's law describes a point process
with a uniform sampling in the logarithm of the time. By construction, strong
log-periodic fluctuations are thus created by this logarithmic sampling.

reduction in the normal-state spectral weight. Even by optimal doping (p=0.16)
these measures of the 'strength' of superconductivity are diminished by up to
40%. This results in a sharp reduction in critical currents and irreversibility
field, respectively. The optimal doping state where these properties are

model, which has an added non-local term. We find that the new term allows for
unambiguous selection of the stress at which two ``phases'' coexist, in
contrast to the original model. For general differential constitutive models we
show the singular nature of stress selection in terms of a saddle connection
between fixed points in the equivalent dynamical system. The result means that
stress selection is unique under most conditions for space non-local models
Finally, illustrated by simple models, we show that stress selection generally
depends on the form of the non-local terms (weak universality).

The stabilization is investigated by electronic transport properties, as they
depend sensitively on the stabilizing interaction between the static structure
and the conduction electrons. Thin-film techniques provide samples which are
well suited for systematic investigations as a function of composition and
structural quality for Al-Cu-Fe and Al-Pd-Re i-phases. For a narrow range of
composition, large transport anomalies occur, reaching a
metal-insulator-transition in thin films of i-Al-Pd-Re. We discuss this in the
framework of a resonant scattering of the conduction electrons with the
quasicrystalline structure, leading to a reduced electronic mobility and
density of states (DOS) at the Fermi energy $E_F$.

of exotic many-body effects due to non-Fermi liquid behavior of interacting
electrons in one dimension. Recent theoretical and experimental results are
reviewed with a focus on electron correlations. Starting from a microscopic
lattice model we derive an effective phase Hamiltonian for conducting
single-wall nanotubes with arbitrary chirality. The parameters of the
Hamiltonian show very weak dependence on the chiral angle, which makes the
low-energy physics of conducting nanotubes universal. The temperature-dependent
resistivity and frequency-dependent optical conductivity of nanotubes with
impurities are evaluated within the Luttinger-like model. Localization effects
are studied. In particular, we found that intra-valley and inter-valley
electron scattering can not coexist at low energies. Low-energy properties of
clean nanotubes are studied beyond the Luttinger liquid approximation. The
strongest Mott-like electron instability occurs at half filling. In the Mott
insulating phase electrons at different atomic sublattices form characteristic
bound states. The energy gaps of $0.01-0.1$ eV occur in all modes of elementary
excitations. We finally discuss observability of the Mott insulating phase in
transport experiments. The accent is made on the charge transfer from external
electrodes which results in a deviation of the electron density from
half-filling.

physics could be embedded into string theory have dramatically changed. The
heterotic string is no longer the only possibility for such an embedding and
other perturbative (or non-perturbative) corners of M-theory, like Type I or
Type II strings seem now possible. It has also been realized that the string
scale $M_s$ is not necessary close to the Planck scale and could be much
smaller, of order the intermediate scale $\sqrt{M_WM_p}$ or even close to the
weak scale. In addition, semi-realistic three generation models have recently
been constructed starting with Type IIB compact orientifolds. I briefly discuss
some of these developements which represent a revolution in our understanding

already been computed.) The chief technical tools include the powerful matrix
integration technique, the n^*-prescription for the spurious poles of 1/qn, and
the detailed analysis of the boundary singularities in five- and
six-dimensional parameter space. It is shown that the total divergent
contribution to the two-loop correction Sigma_2 contains both covariant and
noncovariant components, and is a local function of the external momentum p,
even off the mass-shell, as all nonlocal divergent terms cancel exactly.
Consequently, both the quark mass and field renormalizations are local. The
structure of Sigma_2 implies a quark mass counterterm of the form $\delta m
(lcg) = m\tilde\alpha_s C_F(3+\tilde\alpha_sW) + {\rm O} (\tilde\alpha_s^3)$,
$\tilde\alpha_s = g^2\Gamma(\eps)(4\pi)^{\eps -2}$, with W depending only on
the dimensional regulator epsilon, and on the numbers of colors and flavors. It
turns out that \delta m(lcg) is identical to the mass counterterm in the

first example of a torsion-free branch just-infinite group. We also produce a
new example of branch just-infinite group of intermediate growth, and provide
for it an L-type presentation by generators and relators.

C*-extensions in a way quite similar to the way in which the KK-theory of
Kasparov can. The essential difference is that the role played by split
extensions should be taken by asymptotically split extensions. We call an
extension of a C*-algebra $A$ by a stable C*-algebra $B$ asymptotically split
if there exists an asymptotic homomorphism consisting of right inverses for the
quotient map. An extension is called semi-invertible if it can be made
asymptotically split by adding another extension to it. Our main result is that
there exists a one-to-one correspondence between asymptotic homomorphisms from
$SA$ to $B$ and homotopy classes of semi-invertible extensions of $S^2A$ by
$B$.
