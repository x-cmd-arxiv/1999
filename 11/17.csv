studying the formation processes of black holes. We use the results of recent
2D simulations of core-collapse to obtain the relation between remnant and
progenitor masses and fold it with an initial mass function for the
progenitors. We examine how the calculated black-hole mass distributions are
modified by (i) strong wind mass loss at different evolutionary stages of the
progenitors, and (ii) the presence of close binary companions to the black-hole
progenitors. Thus, we are able to derive the binary black hole mass
distribution. The compact remnant distribution is dominated by neutron stars in
the mass range 1.2-1.6Msun and falls off exponentially at higher remnant
masses. Our results are most sensitive to mass loss from winds which is even
more important in close binaries. Wind mass-loss causes the black hole
distribution to become flatter and limits the maximum possible black-hole mass
(<10-15Msun). We also study the effects of the uncertainties in the explosion
and unbinding energies for different progenitors. The distributions are
continuous and extend over a broad range. We find no evidence for a gap at low
values (3-5Msun) or for a peak at higher values (~7Msun) of black hole masses,

with the current sample of measured black-hole masses in X-ray transients. We
discuss possible biases against the detection or formation of X-ray transients

emission lines, formed in a temperature-inversion layer on the disk surface,
created by the soft X-ray irradiation; c) double-peaked Halpha emission, with a
strength associated with the hard X-ray flux, suggesting that it was probably
emitted from deeper layers than He II 4686. The observed rotational velocities
of all the double-peaked lines suggest that the disk was extended slightly
beyond its tidal radius. Three classes of lines were identified in the spectra

extended optically thin cocoon and significant matter outflow. After the onset
of a hard X-ray flare the disk signatures disappeared, and strong single-peaked
Halpha and Paschen emission was detected, suggesting that the cocoon became
opaque to optical radiation. High-ionisation lines disappeared or weakened. Two

insight into the origin of cosmic rays. Namely, different spallation schemes
predict sharply different trends for the growth of LiBeB abundances with
respect to oxygen. ``Primary'' mechanisms predict BeB $\propto$ O, and are well
motivated by the data if O/Fe is constant at low metallicity. In contrast,
``secondary'' mechanisms predict BeB $\propto$ O$^2$ and are consistent with
the data if O/Fe increases towards low metallicity as some recent data suggest.
Clearly, any primary mechanism, if operative, will dominate early in the
history of the Galaxy. In this paper, we fit the BeB data to a two-component
scheme which includes both primary and secondary trends. In this way, the data
can be used to probe the period in which primary mechanisms are effective. We
analyze the data using consistent stellar atmospheric parameters based on
Balmer line data and the continuum infrared flux. Results depend sensitively on
Pop II O abundances and, unfortunately, on the choice of stellar parameters.
When using recent results which show O/Fe increasing toward lower metallicity,
a two-component Be-O fits indicates that primary and secondary components
contribute equally at [O/H]$_{eq}$ = -1.8 for Balmer line data; and
[O/H]$_{eq}$ = -1.4 to -1.8 for IRFM. We apply these constraints to recent
models for LiBeB origin. The Balmer line data does not show any evidence for
primary production. On the other hand, the IRFM data does indicate a preference
for a two-component model, such as a combination of standard GCR and
metal-enriched particles accelerated in superbubbles. These conclusions rely on
a detailed understanding of the abundance data including systematic effects
which may alter the derived O-Fe and BeB-Fe relations.

abundances required, but is surprisingly close to being in collisional
ionization equilibrium. A high ionization age implies a high internal density
in a young remnant. The fitted emission measure for W49B indicates a minimum
density of 2 cm^-3, with the true density likely to be significantly higher.
W49B probably had a Type Ia progenitor, based on the relative element

contribution from intermediate age components is different in different

formation occurs in short intense burst separated by long quiescent phases. We
have also derived the internal reddening for the stellar population by

correlated with the intermediate principal axis of the gravitational shear
tensor. This allows one to reconstruct the shear field and thereby the full
gravitational potential from the observed galaxy spin fields. We use the
direction of the angular momentum vector without any information of its
magnitude, which requires a measurement of the position angle and inclination
on the sky of each disk galaxy. We present the maximum likelihood shear
inversion procedure, which involves a constrained linear minimization. The
theory is tested against numerical simulations. We find the correlation
strength of nonlinear structures with the initial shear field, and show that
accurate large scale density reconstructions are possible at the expected noise

Coma cluster of galaxies. It is the deepest ever computed in the near-infrared,
for any type of environment, extending over 7 magnitudes, down to ~M_H*+6. The
LF was computed on a near-infrared selected sample of galaxies which
photometry, complete down to the typical dwarf luminosity, is presented in a
companion paper. The Coma LF can be described by a Schechter function with
intermediate slope (alpha~-1.3), plus a dip at M_H~-22 mag. The shape of the
Coma LF in H band is quite similar to the one found in the B band and, with
less confidence, to the R band LF as well. The similarity of the LF in the
optical and H bands implies that in the central region of Coma there is no new
population of galaxies which is too faint to be observed in the optical band
(because dust enshrouded, for instance), down to the magnitudes of dwarfs. The
exponential cut of the LF at the bright end is in good agreement with the one
derived from shallower near-infrared samples of galaxies, both in clusters and
in the field. This fact is suggestive of a similarity of the tip of the mass
function of galaxies, irrespective of the environment where they are found. The
dip at M_H~-22 mag is instead unique among all the so far measured
near-infrared LF, although several published observations are not deep enough
or spanning a suitable wide field to distinctly detect this feature. The faint
end of the LF, reaching M_H~-19 mag (roughly M_B~-15), is steep, but less than
previously suggested from shallower near-infrared observations of an adjacent
region in the Coma cluster. The differences between our measured LF and that
measured previously in other regions suggests a dependency on environment of
the faint end of the mass function (below M*+2.5).

excited acoustic disturbance, emanating from a point source, and propagating
outward as a spherical acoustic wave accompanied by an internal gravity wave.
The waves amplify exponentially in the upward direction. A significant wave
amplitude is therefore found only in a relatively narrow cone about the
vertical. The amplitude of the wave decreases with time. Because of the lateral
spread, the wave amplitude decays faster in 2D and 3D simulations than in 1D.
The initial pulse, which travels at the sound speed, carries most of the energy
injected into the medium. Subsequent wave crests leave the source region at
ever-increasing phase speed, but slow to the sound speed as they approach the
head of the wave. Important conclusions from the 3D solution that were not
anticipated from the plane-wave solution are:
  1. The bulk of the energy is emitted in the upward (and downward) direction;
much less goes into the horizontal direction.
  2. The wave profile narrows from the initial pulse through the amplitude
maxima in the wake of the pulse.
  As a consequence of both points, the shock-heated regions in the wake of the
initial pulse would weaken in strength and shrink in size.

interfaces are modeled by the triply periodic surfaces of constant mean
curvature of the families G, D, P, C(P), I-WP and F-RD. The stability of the
different bicontinuous cubic phases can be explained by the way in which their
universal geometrical properties conspire with the concentration constraints.

We discuss how phase transitions of first order (with phase separation and
surface tension), continuous transitions and (multi)-critical points can be
seen and classified for small systems. Boltzmann defines the entropy as the
logarithm of the area W(E,N)=e^S(E,N) of the surface in the mechanical N-body
phase space at total energy E. The topology of the curvature determinant D(E,N)
of S(E,N) allows the classification of phase transitions without taking the
thermodynamic limit. The first calculation of the entire entropy surface S(E,N)
for the diluted Potts model (ordinary (q=3)-Potts model plus vacancies) on a
50*50 square lattice is shown. The regions in {E,N} where D>0 correspond to
pure phases, ordered resp. disordered, and D<0 represent transitions of first
order with phase separation and ``surface tension''. These regions are bordered
by a line with D=0. A line of continuous transitions starts at the critical
point of the ordinary (q=3)-Potts model and runs down to a branching point P_m.
Along this line \nabla D vanishes in the direction of the eigenvector v_1 of D
with the largest eigen-value \lambda_1\approx 0. It characterizes a maximum of
the largest eigenvalue \lambda_1. This corresponds to a critical line where the
transition is continuous and the surface tension disappears. Here the
neighboring phases are indistinguishable. The region where two or more lines
with D=0 cross is the region of the (multi)-critical point. The micro-canonical
ensemble allows to put these phenomena entirely on the level of mechanics.

the excitation spectrum of one $^3$He impurity in liquid $^4$He at T=0 with the
aim of illustrating the power of the correlated basis function formalism in
describing heavily correlated systems. The strong interatomic interaction and
the large density require the theory to be pushed to a high degree of
sophistication. A many-body correlation operator containing explicit two- and
thre-particle correlation functions is needed to obtain a realistic ground
state wave function, whereas a perturbative expansion including up to two
phonon correlated states must be enforced to study the impurity excitation
energies. The theory describes accurately the experimental spectrum along all

is a preferred-frame bimetric theory with flat background metric. Before coming
to cosmology, the motivation for an "" ether theory "" is exposed at length; the
investigated concept of ether is presented: it is a compressible fluid, and
gravity is seen as Archimedes' thrust due to the pressure gradient in that
fluid. The construction of the theory is explained and the current status of
the experimental confrontation is analysed, both in some detail. An analytical
cosmological solution is obtained for a general form of the energy-momentum
tensor. According to that theory, expansion is necessarily accelerated, both by
vacuum and even by matter. In one case, the theory predicts expansion, the
density increasing without limit as time goes back to infinity. High density is
thus obtained in the past, without a big-bang singularity. In the other case,
the Universe follows a sequence of (non-identical) contraction-expansion
cycles, each with finite maximum energy density; the current expansion phase
will end by infinite dilution in some six billions of years. The density ratio
of the present cycle (ratio of the maximum to current densities) is not
determined by the current density and the current Hubble constant H0, unless a
special assumption is made. Since cosmological redshifts approaching z = 4 are
observed, the density ratio should be at least 100. From this and the estimate
of H0, the time spent since the maximum density is constrained to be larger
than several hundreds of billions of years. Yet if a high density ratio,
compatible with the standard explanation for the light elements and the 2.7 K
radiation, is assumed, then the age of the Universe is much larger still.

state in the form $P=(\Gamma-1)\rho\epsilon$ where P, $\rho$, $\varep$ and
$\Gamma$ are the pressure, rest mass density, specific internal energy, and the
adiabatic constant with $\Gamma=2$. As initial conditions, we adopt models of
corotational and irrotational binary neutron stars in a quasi-equilibrium state
which are obtained using the conformal flatness approximation for the three
geometry as well as an assumption that a helicoidal Killing vector exists. In
this paper, we pay particular attention to the final product of the
coalescence. We find that the final product depends sensitively on the initial
compactness parameter of the neutron stars : In a merger between sufficiently
compact neutron stars, a black hole is formed in a dynamical timescale. As the
compactness is decreased, the formation timescale becomes longer and longer. It
is also found that a differentially rotating massive neutron star is formed
instead of a black hole for less compact binary cases, in which the rest mass
of each star is less than 70-80% of the maximum allowed mass of a spherical
star. In the case of black hole formation, we roughly evaluate the mass of the
disk around the black hole. For the merger of corotational binaries, a disk of
mass $\sim 0.05-0.1M_*$ may be formed, where M_* is the total rest mass of the
system. On the other hand, for the merger of irrotational binaries, the disk
mass appears to be very small : < 0.01M_*.

it is built at the CSB (chiral symmetry breaking) scale by means of
perturbation theory it has the structure of a generalized Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
(NJL) model with CSB due to attractive forces in the scalar channel. We show
that if the lowest scalar meson state is sufficiently lighter than the heavy
pseudoscalar $\pi'$ then QCD favors a low-energy effective theory in which
higher dimensional operators (of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio type) are dominated and
relatively strong. A light scalar quarkonium ($m_\sigma = 500 \div 600$ MeV)
would provide an evidence in favor to this NJL mechanism. Thus the non-chiral
Quasilocal Quark Models (QQM) in the dynamical symmetry-breaking regime are
considered as approximants for low-energy action of QCD. In the mean-field
(large-N_c) approach the equation on critical coupling surface is derived. The
mass spectrum of scalar and pseudoscalar excited states is calculated in
leading-log approach which is compatible with the truncation of the QCD
effective action with few higher-dimensional operators. The matching to QCD
based on the Chiral Symmetry Restoration sum rules is performed and it helps to
select out the relevant pattern of CSB as well as to enhance considerably the
predictability of this approach.

vortices and nexuses (a nexus is a monopole-like soliton whose world line
mediates certain allowed changes of field strengths on vortex surfaces) carry
topological charge quantized in units of 1/N for gauge group SU(N). These
fractional charges arise from the interpretation of the standard topological
charge integral as a sum of (integral) intersection numbers weighted by certain
(fractional) traces. We show that without nexuses the sum of intersection
numbers gives vanishing topological charge (since vortex surfaces are closed
and compact). With nexuses living as world lines on vortices, the contributions
to the total intersection number are weighted by different trace factors, and
yield a picture of the total topological charge as a linking of a closed nexus
world line with a vortex surface; this linking gives rise to a non-vanishing
but integral topological charge. This reflects the standard 2\pi periodicity of
the theta angle. We argue that the Witten-Veneziano relation, naively violating
2\pi periodicity, scales properly with N at large N without requiring 2\pi N
periodicity. This reflects the underlying composition of localized fractional
topological charge, which are in general widely separated. Some simple models
are given of this behavior. Nexuses lead to non-standard vortex surfaces for
all SU(N) and to surfaces which are not manifolds for N>2. We generalize
previously-introduced nexuses to all SU(N) in terms of a set of fundamental
nexuses, which can be distorted into a configuration resembling the 't
Hooft-Polyakov monopole with no strings. The existence of localized but
widely-separated fractional topological charges, adding to integers only on
long distance scales, has implications for chiral symmetry breakdown.

The reduced N-particle Lagrangian describes geodesic motion in a

negative gauge coupling leads in classical dynamics to the formation of
geometric bags in the case of two or three particles. The ordering problem
within the quantization scheme for $N$-particles is solved by canonical
quantization of a pseudoclassical Schroedinger theory obtained by adding to the

flows enable us to construct the Jacobi inversion problems for some soliton
hierarchies.
