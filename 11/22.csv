eV, cosmic-ray and high energy, 100 TeV, neutrino production in GRBs is
discussed in the light of recent GRB and cosmic-ray observations. Emphasis is
put on model predictions that can be tested with operating and planned
cosmic-ray and neutrino detectors. The predicted neutrino intensity, E^2
dN/dE=3\times 10^{-9} GeV/(cm^2 s sr) for 10^{14} eV<E<10^{16} eV, implies that
a km^2 neutrino detector would observe tens of events per year correlated with
GRBs, and will be able to test for neutrino properties with an accuracy many
orders of magnitude better than is currently possible. The predicted production
rate of high-energy protons, which is consistent with that required to account
for the observed ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) flux, implies that
operating and planned cosmic-ray detectors can test the GRB model for UHECR
production. If the predicted sources are found, cosmic-ray detectors will
provide us with a technique to investigate the inter-galactic magnetic field.

developed from an existing radiative transfer code (Bianchi, Ferrara &
Giovanardi, 1996, ApJ, 465, 127). The model's main features are: a complete
treatment of multiple scattering within geometries appropriate for spirals; a
full coverage of spectral range of stellar emission; the use of empirically
determined dust properties (some of which are derived in the present work); the
production of maps of the dust temperature distribution, together with
simulated optical, FIR and sub-millimetre images. The model has been applied to
observations of stellar and dust emission in the galaxy NGC 6946.
  It is found that optically thick models (central face-on optrical depth tau_V
\~ 5) are necessary to explain the observed FIR output. For such models, almost
30-40% of the intrinsic starlight is absorbed. The observed ratio of FIR and
optical scalelengths can be explained if the dust distribution is more extended
than the stellar. However, because of the less steep gradients of optical
emission in optically thick cases, a very extended dust distribution is needed
(alpha_d ~ 3 alpha_s). The distribution of atomic gas in NGC 6946 has a similar
extent.
  I discuss the approximations in the modelling (mainly the use of smooth
distributions against the observed clumpiness of the interstellar medium) and
the implications of the results.

After converting to an excess of galaxies physically associated with the QSO,
this lack of strong correlation is shown to be consistent with the clustering

we consider the hydrodynamic modes in the case of a uniform Bose gas. A finite
thermal conductivity and shear viscosity give rise to a damping of the first

diffusive equilibrium between the condensate and non-condensate. The
relaxational mode associated with this equilibration process is strongly
coupled to thermal fluctuations and reduces to the usual thermal diffusion mode
above the Bose-Einstein transition. In contrast to the standard Landau
two-fluid hydrodynamics, we predict a damped mode centered at zero frequency,

introduce for partially breaking supersymmetry, (2) the possibility of having
low-energy degrees of freedom which are not observable to us because they are
physically located on a different brane, (3) the fundamental scale may be much
smaller than the Planck scale. Furthermore, although the resulting cosmological
constant in the scenarios we outline is naturally suppressed by weak coupling
constants of gravitational strength, it need not be exactly zero, raising the
possibility it could be in the range favoured by recent cosmological
observations.

algorithm does not involve couplings of the process with different initial
conditions and it is not tied up to monotonicity requirements. Furthermore, it
directly provides perfect samples of finite windows of the infinite-volume
measure, subjected to time and space ``user-impatience bias''. The algorithm is
based on a two-step procedure: (i) a perfect-simulation scheme for a (finite
and random) relevant portion of a (space-time) marked Poisson processes (free
birth-and-death process, free loss networks), and (ii) a ``cleaning'' algorithm
that trims out this process according to the interaction rules of the target
process. The first step involves the perfect generation of ``ancestors'' of a
given object, that is of predecessors that may have an influence on the
birth-rate under the target process. The second step, and hence the whole
procedure, is feasible if these ``ancestors'' form a finite set with
probability one. We present a sufficiency criteria for this condition, based on
the absence of infinite clusters for an associated (backwards) oriented
