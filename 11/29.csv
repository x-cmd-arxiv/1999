star-forming regions. The CCS distribution shows remarkable clumpy structure,
and 25 clumps are identified in 7 clouds. Seven clumps with extremely narrow
nonthermal linewidths < 0.1 km/s are among the most quiescent clumps ever
found. The CCS clumps tend to exist around the higher density regions traced by
NH_3 emission or submillimeter continuum sources, and the distribution is not
spherically symmetric. Variation of the CCS abundance was suggested as an
indicator of the evolutionary status of star formation. However, we can only
find a weak correlation between N(CCS) and $n_{H_2,vir}$. The velocity
distributions of CCS clouds reveal that a systematic velocity pattern generally
exists. The most striking feature in our data is a ring structure in the
position-velocity diagram of L1544 with an well-resolved inner hole of 0.04 pc
x 0.13 km/s and an outer boundary of 0.16 pc x 0.55 km/s. This
position-velocity structure clearly indicates an edge-on disk or ring geometry,
and it can be interpreted as a collapsing disk with an infall velocity
$\gtrsim$ 0.1 km/s and a rotational velocity less than our velocity resolution.
Nonthermal linewidth distribution is generally coherent in CCS clouds, which
could be evidence for the termination of Larson's Law at small scales, $\sim$
0.1 pc.

  pages with 6 figures",,"10.1007/978-94-010-0938-6_17",,"astro-ph",,"  (Abridged) Accurate luminosity functions (LF) for a dozen globular clusters
have now been measured at or just beyond their half-light radius using HST.
They span almost the entire cluster main sequence below ~ 0.75 Msolar. All
these clusters exhibit LF that rise continuously from an absolute I magnitude
M_I ~ 6 to a peak at M_I ~ 8.5-9 and then drop with increasing M_I.
Transformation of the LF into mass functions (MF) by means of the most recent
mass luminosity relations that are consistent with all presently available data
on the physical properties of low mass, low metallicity stars shows that all
the LF observed so far can be obtained from MF having the shape of a log-normal
distribution with characteristic mass m_c=0.33 +/- 0.03 Msolar and standard
deviation sigma = 1.81 +/- 0.19. After correction for the effects of mass
segregation, the variation of the ratio of the number of higher to lower mass
stars with cluster mass or any simple orbital parameter or the expected time to
disruption recently computed for these clusters shows no statistically
significant trend over a range of this last parameter of more than a factor of
100. We conclude that the global MF of these clusters have not been measurably
modified by evaporation and tidal interactions with the Galaxy and, thus,
should reflect the initial distribution of stellar masses. Since the log-normal
function that we find is also very similar to the one obtained independently
for much younger clusters and to the form expected theoretically, the
implication seems to be unavoidable that it represents the true stellar IMF for
this type of stars in this mass range.

between the two extremal phases characterizing these compounds. The extremal
phases are known to be an antiferromagnetic (AF) Mott insulator one, on one
side, and a non-superconducting itinerant metal on the other. Numerous
inelastic neutron scattering studies on underdoped samples shows most directly
that the static AF order of the parent phase does not disappear by doping but
transforms in such a way that at least fluctuating and local AF order persists,
coexisting with superconductivity. Structurally, the model of stripe-type
correlations accounts for the coexistence while its genuine dynamics might hide
the most interesting physics of cuprates, including the pairing mechanism.
Indeed, there is an impressive accumulation of knowledge in favour of AF
correlations underlying the pairing. Some crucial properties of these
correlations have been recently pointed out: they should involve small velocity
collective modes of the wave vector identical to that of static AF order while
their energy scale (<50 meV) should be rather low compared with any other
involved. In this work we show on phenomenological ground that the very concept
of a disordered AF phase interpenetrated with non-magnetic boundaries
comprises, irrespective of structural details of stripe order, the dynamical
ingredients (fractons) which may be important for pairing. The model elaborated
below introduces a new energy scale (10-50 meV) associated with slow (or almost
localized) and well-defined AF excitations, interpreting simultaneously most of
the neutron scattering results in a consistent and a natural way.

  abstract in STACS 2000",,,"cs.LO cs.CC",,"  Motivated by description logics, we investigate what happens to the
complexity of modal satisfiability problems if we only allow formulas built
from literals, $\wedge$, $\Diamond$, and $\Box$. Previously, the only known
result was that the complexity of the satisfiability problem for K dropped from
PSPACE-complete to coNP-complete (Schmidt-Schauss and Smolka, 1991 and Donini
et al., 1992). In this paper we show that not all modal logics behave like K.
In particular, we show that the complexity of the satisfiability problem with
respect to frames in which each world has at least one successor drops from
PSPACE-complete to P, but that in contrast the satisfiability problem with
respect to the class of frames in which each world has at most two successors
remains PSPACE-complete. As a corollary of the latter result, we also solve the
open problem from Donini et al.'s complexity classification of description
logics (Donini et al., 1997). In the last section, we classify the complexity
of the satisfiability problem for K for all other restrictions on the set of
operators.

relativity are reviewed. General conclusions one may draw from these are: (i)
There is a need to restrict the scope of the possible ansatze, and (ii) the
angular behaviour is a valuable commodity. This latter observation follows from
a large number of analytic models exhibiting a NUT-like behaviour. A method of
getting around problem (ii) is presented on a simple example. To alleviate
problem (i) for rigidly rotating perfect fluids, approximation schemes based on
a series expansion in the angular velocity are suggested. A pioneering work,
due to Hartle, explores the global properties of matched space-times to
quadratic order in the angular velocity.
  As a first example of the applications, it is shown that the rigidly rotating
incompressible fluid cannot be Petrov type D.

the n shocks meet in $r^*$ at time $t^*$. The microscopic position of the
