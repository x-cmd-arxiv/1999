the oldest stars in the Milky Way should have formed in the first halos where
gas was able to cool, at $z\simeq 20$. These earliest, weakly bound dwarf
galaxies probably turned only a small fraction of their gas to stars, which
should be metal-poor. However, the merging rate in the early universe was much
faster than the present one, so massive halos with more efficient star
formation and metallicities up to the highest values present today in the bulge
could have formed less than $10^9$ years after the oldest stars. The mean
metallicity produced in the universe by a given redshift is related to the mean
surface brightness of star-forming galaxies above this redshift, and also to
the reionization epoch if galaxies were the dominant sources of ionizing
radiation. The biased distribution of the early dwarf galaxies where the first
stars formed should result in an age gradient with radius of the
low-metallicity stars in the Milky Way, with the oldest ones concentrated in
the bulge and the youngest in the outer halo.

study the precision with which the multipole moments of the temperature
two-point correlation function can be predicted by means of the slow-roll
approximation. We ask whether this precision is good enough for the forthcoming
high precision observations by means of the MAP and Planck satellites. The
error in the multipole moments due to the slow-roll approximation is
demonstrated to be bigger than the error in the power spectrum. For power-law
inflation with $n_S=0.9$ the error from the leading order slow-roll
approximation is $\approx 5%$ for the amplitudes and $\approx 20%$ for the
quadrupoles. For the next-to-leading order the errors are within a few percent.
The errors increase with $|n_S - 1|$. To obtain a precision of 1% it is
necessary, but in general not sufficient, to use the next-to-leading order. In
the case of power-law inflation this precision is obtained for the spectral
indices if $|n_S - 1| < 0.02$ and for the quadrupoles if $|n_S - 1| < 0.15$
only. The errors in the higher multipoles are even larger than those for the
quadrupole, e.g. $\approx 15%$ for l=100, with $n_S = 0.9$ at the
next-to-leading order. We find that the accuracy of the slow-roll approximation
may be improved by shifting the pivot scale of the primordial spectrum (the
scale at which the slow-roll parameters are fixed) into the regime of acoustic
oscillations. Nevertheless, the slow-roll approximation cannot be improved
beyond the next-to-leading order in the slow-roll parameters.

rule, the draw downs are always accompanied by a sizable separation of one
strong collective eigenstate of the correlation matrix which, at the same time,
reduces the variance of the noise states. The opposite applies to draw ups. In
this case the dynamics spreads more uniformly over the eigenstates which
results in an increase of the total information entropy.

right-handed neutrinos and a singlet Higgs field, and study the neutrino masses

around the supersymmetry breaking scale through the vacuum expectation value of
the singlet Higgs field. This model may induce spontaneous R-parity violation
via the vacuum expectation value of the right-handed sneutrino. In the case,
the effective theory is similar to a bilinear R-parity violating model. There
are two sources for the neutrino masses: one is this bilinear R-parity breaking
effect, and the other is the ordinary seesaw effect between left- and
right-handed neutrinos. Combining these two effects, the hierarchical neutrino
mass pattern arises even when the neutrino Yukawa matrices are not
hierarchical. We acquire appropriate masses and mixings to explain both the
solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations.

``conformal restriction property''. We establish a generalization of Cardy's

as the frequency bound, otherwise the analysis will be unreliable and plagued
with aliasing distortions. The RR samplings do not satisfy the above
requirements and therefore their spectral analysis might be unreliable.
  In order to demonstrate the feasibility of aliasing in RR spectral analysis,
we have done an experiment which have shown clearly how the aliasing was
developed. In the experiments, one of us (A.G) had kept his high breathing rate
constant with the aid of metronome for more than 5 minutes. The breathing rate
was larger than one-half the heart rate. Very accurate results were obtained
and the resulting aliasing well understood. To our best knowledge this is the
first controlled experiment of this kind coducted on humans.
  We compared the RR spectral analysis with the spectrum of the ECG signals
from which the RR intervals were extracted. In the significant for RR analysis
frequencies (below one-half Hertz) significant differences were observed.
  In conclusion we recommend to study the spectral analysis of the ECG signal
in the free of aliasing frequency range.

underlying assumptions as to its unlimited validity. It is demonstrated that
from a empiric-physical point of view these assumptions are not given in the
case of inertial systems separated by very large distances. Analogous to the
impossibility to measure motion relative to absolute space, it turns out to be
physically non feasible to extend the coordinate system of any reference frame
considered at rest relative to a distantly moving system for a direct
comparision of the coordinates, and vice versa. The extended Lorentz
transformation strictly based on first physical principles predicts the
possibility of superluminal propagation of very distant material bodies and, in
