kinematic line widths and systemic velocities. The [O II] and H I line widths
correlate most strongly, showing an intrinsic dispersion of ~20 km/s, or ~10%

cases, the [O II] line widths underestimate the neutral hydrogen width by 50%.
Reliable velocity widths can also be obtained from the stellar Balmer and Ca
H&K absorption lines, even for some of the very late-type galaxies which have
strong emission lines. The intrinsic dispersion is <10% between the stellar

At the same time the decrease of nu_L is accompanied by decrease of the Lyman
continuum flux and leads to smaller heating and weaker ionization of the

radiative precursor is of 10^4 cm and corresponds to several mean free paths of

slowly decreases for larger U_1 due to the strong rize of the preshock gas

  Density","Accpeted for ApJ vol 531, March 2000",,"10.1086/308505",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop the theory of interstellar scintillation as caused by an irregular
plasma having a power-law spatial density spectrum with a spectral exponent of
4 corresponding to a medium with abrupt changes in its density. An ``outer
scale'' is included in the model representing the typical scale over which the
density of the medium remains uniform. Such a spectrum could be used to model
plasma shock fronts in supernova remnants or other plasma discontinuities. We
investigate and develop equations for the decorrelation bandwidth of
diffractive scintillations and the refractive scintillation index and compare
our results with pulsar measurements. We consider both a medium concentrated in
a thin layer and an extended irregular medium. We conclude that the
discontinuity model gives satisfactory agreement for many diffractive
measurements, in particular the VLBI meaurements of the structure function
exponent between 5/3 and 2. However, it gives less satisfactory agreement for
the refractive scintillation index than does the Kolmogorov turbulence
spectrum. The comparison suggests that the medium consists of a pervasive
background distribution of turbulence embedded with randomly placed discrete
plasma structures such as shocks or HII regions. This can be modeled by a
composite spectrum following the Kolmogorov form at high wavenumbers and
steepening at lower wavenumbers corresponding to the typical (inverse) size of
the discrete structures. Such a model can also explain the extreme scattering
events. However, lines of sight through the enhanced scattering prevalent at
low galactic latitudes are accurately described by the Kolmogorov spectrum in
an extended medium and do not appear to have a similar low-wavenumber
steepening.

have zero points and slopes which change most of the original synthetic colors
by less than 0.02 mag and 5%, respectively. The adopted Teff scale (Bell &
Gustafsson 1989) is confirmed by the extraordinary agreement between the
predicted and observed angular diameters of the field stars. We have also

coolest dwarfs (Teff < 5000 K), our calibrated, solar-metallicity model colors

epochs using a 30m EISCAT antenna at 933 MHz. These have been used to constrain

law is a satisfactory model for the electron density spectrum at scales between
20 megameters and 1 gigameter. We compare the observations with model
calculations from weak scintillation theory and the known transverse velocities
of the pulsar and the Earth. The simplest model is that the scattering is
uniformly distributed along the 310 pc line of sight (l=140 deg, b=32 deg) and
is stationary in the LSR. With the scattering measure as the only free
parameter, this model fits the data within the errors and a range of about
+/-10 km/s in velocity is also allowed.
  The integrated level of turbulence is low, being comparable to that found
toward PSR B0950+08, and suggests a region of low local turbulence over as much
as 90 deg. in longitude including the galactic anti-center. If, on the other
hand, the scattering occurs in a compact region, the observed time scales
require a specific velocity-distance relation. In particular, enhanced
scattering in a shell at the edge of the local bubble, proposed by Bhat et al.
(1998), near 72 pc toward the pulsar, must be moving at about ~ 17 km/s;
however, the low scattering measure argues against a shell of enhanced
scattering in this direction. The analysis also excludes scattering in the
termination shock of the solar wind or in a nebula associated with the pulsar.

the density profiles of their dark halos, or on cosmological parameters. This
has important implications for numerous claims made in the literature regarding
the halos of LSB galaxies, such as the self-similarity of their rotation
curves, and their inconsistency with certain cosmological models or with cold
dark matter altogether. Only in one case is the data of sufficient spatial
resolution to obtain reliable constraints on the slope of the central density
distribution of the dark matter halo. For this single case, we find a central
density cusp with a slope 0.55 < alpha < 1.26 at the 99.73 percent confidence

lens proper motion can be determined by simply measuring the turning time of
the color curve instead of fitting the overall color or light curves. We also
find that even for a very small fraction of blended light, the color changes
induced by the blending effect is equivalent to those caused by the
limb-darkening effect, causing serious distortion in the observed color curve.
Therefore, to obtain useful information about the lens and source star from the

eliminate or correct for the blending effect. We discuss about the methods for

in the early days of laser spectroscopy. Since its lower energy level is 4200 K
above the ground state, the laser emission must arise from the inner part of
IRC+10216's circumstellar envelope. To better characterize this environment, we
observed other, thermally emitting, vibrationally excited HCN lines and find
that they, like the laser line, arise in a region of temperature approximately
1000 K that is located within the dust formation radius; this conclusion is
supported by the linewidth of the laser. The (04(0)0), J=9-8 laser might be
chemically pumped and may be the only known laser (or maser) that is excited
both in the laboratory and in space by a similar mechanism.

was extremely inhomogeneous, suggesting that the high redshift intergalactic

should be found today in the central regions of rich galaxy clusters. In the
Milky Way's bulge and stellar halo little correlation is expected between age
and metallicity. Some of the lowest metallicity stars may be relatively young.
Many of the oldest stars may have high metallicity. Spheroid stars were formed
before and during halo assembly, the oldest now lying preferentially at small
radii, while low metallicity stars lie preferentially at large radii. The bulk
of the Milky Way's stellar spheroid came from a small number of progenitors. It

each point of a superposition of hundreds of `cold' streams. Such streams have
been detected in the Solar neighborhood.

  1 issue)",,"10.1086/308611",,"astro-ph",,"  The ASCA satellite has recently detected variable hard X-ray emission from
two Class I protostars in the rho Oph cloud, YLW15 (IRS43) and WL6, with a
characteristic time scale ~20h. In YLW15, the X-ray emission is in the form of
quasi-periodic energetic flares, which we explain in terms of strong magnetic
shearing and reconnection between the central star and the accretion disk. In
WL6, X-ray flaring is rotationally modulated, and appears to be more like the
solar-type magnetic activity ubiquitous on T Tauri stars. We find that YLW15 is
a fast rotator (near break-up), while WL6 rotates with a significantly longer
period. We derive a mass M_\star ~ 2 M_\odot and \simlt 0.4 M_\odot for the
central stars of YLW15 and WL6 respectively. On the long term, the interactions
between the star and the disk results in magnetic braking and angular momentum
loss of the star. On time scales t_{br} ~ a few 10^5 yrs, i.e., of the same
order as the estimated duration of the Class~I protostar stage. Close to the
birthline there must be a mass-rotation relation, t_{br} \simpropto M_\star,
such that stars with M_\star \simgt 1-2 M_\odot are fast rotators, while their
lower-mass counterparts have had the time to spin down. The rapid rotation and
strong star-disk magnetic interactions of YLW15 also naturally explain the
observation of X-ray ``superflares''. In the case of YLW15, and perhaps also of
other protostars, a hot coronal wind (T~10^6 K) may be responsible for the VLA
thermal radio emission. This paper thus proposes the first clues to the
rotation status and evolution of protostars.

erg s-1 0.1-2 keV) of the 'composite' class of galaxies. This enigmatic class
of objects presents narrow-emission line optical spectra classifying these
galaxies as star-forming on the basis of the diagnostic emission line ratios;
yet, the presence of weak Halpha broad wings also suggests the presence of a
weak or obscured AGN. The ASCA spectrum can be represented with a power-law
with a photon index of 1.76+-0.08. Strong variability is detected (by about a
factor of three) between the ROSAT and ASCA 1-2 keV flux. These characteristics
clearly suggest an AGN origin for the X-ray emission. However, the precise
nature of this AGN remains still uncertain. There is no evidence for a high
absorbing column density above the Galactic. Moreover, there is no strong
evidence for an Fe line at 6.4 keV, with the 90 per cent upper limit on the
equivalent width being 0.9 keV. Thus the X-ray spectrum is consistent with an
unobscured Seyfert-1 interpretation. This discrepancy with the optical
spectrum, may be explained by either a strong star-forming component or a
'dusty' ionised absorber. Finally, the possibility that IRAS00317-2142 may
harbour a heavily obscured AGN where the X-ray emission is mainly due to
scattered light, appears less plausible due to the high value of the fx/f[OIII]
ratio which is more indicative of unobscured Seyfert-1 type AGN.

is found that inter- and intra-subband interactions may drive the electron
system of the wire into a gapped state. If the nominal electron densities in
the two subbands are sufficiently close to each other, then the leading
instability is the inter-subband charge-density wave (CDW). For large density
imbalance, the interaction in the inter-subband Cooper channel may lead to a
superconducting instability. The total charge-density mode, responsible for the
conductance of an ideal wire, always remains gapless, which enforces the
two-terminal conductance to be at the universal value of 2e^2/h per occupied
subband. On the contrary, the tunneling density of states (DOS) in the bulk of
the wire acquires a hard gap, above which the DOS has a non-universal
singularity. This singularity is weaker than the square-root divergency
characteristic for non-interacting quasiparticles near a gap edge due to the
""dressing"" of massive modes by a gapless total charge density mode. The DOS for
tunneling into the end of a wire in a CDW-gapped state preserves the power-law
behavior due to the frustration the edge introduces into the CDW order. This
work is related to the vast literature on coupled 1D systems, and most of all,
on two-leg Hubbard ladders. Whenever possible, we give derivations of the
important results by other authors, adopted for the context of our study.

that price is the gradient of utility in equilibrium, but I show that price as

consequence is that, in a nonintegrable dynamical system, price cannot be
expressed as a function of demand or supply variables. Another consequence is
that utility maximization does not describe equiulibrium. I point out that the
maximization of Gibbs entropy would describe equilibrium, if equilibrium could
be achieved, but equilibrium does not describe real markets. To emphasize the

thermodynamic properties such as the specific-heat difference, the
thermodynamic critical field H_c(T), as well as the upper critical field

including anisotropy effects, yielding electron-phonon coupling anisotropy
parameters <a_k^2> ranging beween 0.02 and 0.03 for the whole series, and Fermi
velocity anisotropy parameters of <b_k^2> = 0.245-0.3. Excellent agreement
between theory and experiment was achieved for these parameters, the Sommerfeld
constant and model phonon spectra determined from specific heat measurements.
An analysis of the previously investigated boronitride La3Ni2B2N3 for

Coulomb friction. Depending on the coefficients of normal restitution
$\epsilon$ and Coulomb friction $\mu$, we find qualitatively different

1) and large $\mu$, friction does not change the cooling properties
qualitatively compared to a constant coefficient of tangential restitution. In
particular, the asymptotic state is characterized by a constant ratio of
rotational and translational energies, both decaying according to Haff's law.
However, for small $\epsilon$ and small $\mu$, the dissipation of rotational
energy is suppressed, so that the asymptotic state is characterized by constant
rotational energy while the translational energy continues to decay as
predicted by Haff's law. Introducing either surface roughness for grazing
collisions or cohesion forces for collisions with vanishing normal load, causes
the rotational energy to decay according to Haff's law again in the asymptotic
long-time limit with, however, an intermediate regime of approximately constant
rotational energy.

characterized by the high mobility of the atoms located on the cluster surface;
the second, homogeneous melting (at approx. 270 K), involves diffusive motion
