evolution of galactic discs. The models are ``calibrated'' on the Milky Way
disc and are successfully extended to other discs with the help of simple
``scaling'' relations, obtained in the framework of semi-analytic models of
galaxy formation. We find that our models exhibit oxygen abundance gradients
that increase in absolute value with decreasing disc luminosity (when expressed
in dex/kpc) and are independent of disc luminosity (when expressed in
dex/scalelength), both in agreement with observations. We notice an important
strong correlation between abundance gradient and disc scalelength. These
results support the idea of ``homologuous evolution'' of galactic discs.

pronounced time delay between variations seen in their optical continuum and in
their emission lines. In effect, the emission lines are light echoes of the
continuum. This light travel-time delay provides a characteristic radius of the
region producing the emission lines. The cross correlation function (CCF) is
the standard tool used to measure the time lag between the continuum and line
variations. For the few well-sampled AGN, the lag ranges from 1-100 days,
depending upon which line is used and the luminosity of the AGN. In the best
sampled AGN, NGC 5548, the H_beta lag shows year-to-year changes, ranging from
about 8.7 days to about 22.9 days over a span of 8 years. In this paper it is
demonstrated that, in the context of AGN variability studies, the lag estimate
using the CCF is biased too low and subject to a large variance. Thus the
year-to-year changes of the measured lag in NGC 5548 do not necessarily imply
changes in the AGN structure. The bias and large variance are consequences of
finite duration sampling and the dominance of long timescale trends in the
light curves, not due to noise or irregular sampling. Lag estimates can be
substantially improved by removing low frequency power from the light curves
prior to computing the CCF.

surveys in progress. The question of how the ""a priori"" selection of some
classes of objects ""biases"" the mapping of the underlying mass density field is
discussed in some detail. I then emphasise the advantages of using clusters of
galaxies selected in the X-ray band as tracers of large--scale structure,
summarising the most recent results of the REFLEX survey, which is under
completion. The strong potential of using X-ray clusters to study the evolution
of structure to large redshifts is underlined. I then summarise some of the
most recent statistical results on the clustering of galaxies and clusters,
using the two-point correlation function xi(s) and the power spectrum P(k). In
particular, I concentrate on the increased information available on the
detailed shape of these functions on large scales, lambda~100/h Mpc. I argue
that significant evidence is accumulating from different observations that P(k)
has a well-defined and possibly narrow peak around k~0.05 h/Mpc. I conclude
with a glimpse into the future of large-scale structure surveys at high
redshifts, describing the features of the VIRMOS deep survey, which will soon

Press-Schechter formalism to evaluate the number abundance of clusters of
galaxies, as well as to determine the density parameter of the universe from
the infalling flow. Therefore, the understanding of collapse dynamics play a
key role for extracting the cosmological information. Here, we consider the
modified version of the spherical infall model. We derive the mean field
equations from the Newtonian fluid equations, in which the influence of
cosmological background inhomogeneity is incorporated into the averaged
quantities as the {\it backreaction}. By calculating the averaged quantities
explicitly, we obtain the simple expressions and find that in case of the
scale-free power spectrum, the density fluctuations with the negative spectral
index make the infalling velocities slow. This suggests that we underestimate
the density parameter $\Omega$ when using the simple spherical infall model. In
cases with the index $n>0$, the effect of background inhomogeneity could be
negligible and the spherical infall model becomes the good approximation for
the infalling flows. We also present a realistic example with the cold dark
matter power spectrum. There, the anisotropic random velocity leads to slowing
down the mean infalling velocities.

separate observations spanning 5 days in April 1994 with the Advanced Satellite
for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA). An X-ray flare was found at the
beginning of the second observation with a maximum luminosity of 4.9E32 ergs/s,
which is five times larger than that of the quiescent phase (the first
observation). It then declined with an e-folding time of ~5.6E4 sec to the
pre-flare level in the third observation. The X-ray spectra are explained by
absorbed thin-thermal plasma models. The temperature in the quiescent phase of
about 2.7 keV is significantly higher than that of main-sequence OB stars and
similar to low mass young stellar objects (YSOs) and other Herbig Ae/Be stars
observed with ASCA. The temperature increased in the flare phase to about 6.7
keV at the flux maximum, then decreased to 3.2 keV in the decay phase.
  These facts strongly suggest that X-rays from Herbig Ae/Be stars, at least
for MWC297, are attributable to magnetic activity similar to low mass YSOs.
Since no theory predicts surface convection zone in massive stars like MWC297,
our results may require a mechanism other than the conventional stellar dynamo
theory. Possible magnetic activity could be either the stellar interior shear
or the inherited magnetic field from the parent molecular cloud.

power-law PDSs are displayed by the longest bursts (T_90 > 100 s) in which the
range of self-similar time scales covers more than 2 decades. Shorter bursts
have apparent PDS slopes more strongly affected by statistical fluctuations.
The underlying power law can then be reproduced with high accuracy by averaging
the PDSs for a large sample of bursts. This power-law has a slope alpha\approx
-5/3 and a sharp break at 1 Hz.
  The power-law PDS provides a new sensitive tool for studies of gamma-ray
bursts. In particular, we calculate the PDSs of bright bursts in separate
energy channels. The PDS flattens in the hard channel (h\nu > 300 keV) and
steepens in the soft channel (h\nu < 50 keV), while the PDS of bolometric light
curves approximately follows the -5/3 law.
  We then study dim bursts and compare them to the bright ones. We find a
strong correlation between the burst brightness and the PDS slope. This
correlation shows that the bursts are far from being standard candles and dim
bursts should be intrinsically weak. The time dilation of dim bursts is
probably related to physical processes occurring in the burst rather than to a
cosmological redshift.
  Finally, we test the internal shock model against the observed PDS. We
demonstrate how the model can reproduce the -5/3 power law.

a flux whose total through a closed hypersurface is equal to zero. For given

these results, we then construct a general expression for the parent Lagrangian
