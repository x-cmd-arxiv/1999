  Redshift","Submitted to ApJL. AASTex, 14 pages, 7 figures",,"10.1086/308670",,"astro-ph",,"  We have carried out model calculations of the photoionized intergalactic
medium (IGM) to determine the effects on the predicted ionic column densities
due to uncertainties in the published dielectronic recombination (DR) rate
coefficients. Based on our previous experimental work and a comparison of
published theoretical DR rates, we estimate there is in general a factor of 2
uncertainty in existing DR rates used for modeling the IGM. We demonstrate that
this uncertainty results in factors of ~1.9 uncertainty in the predicted N V
and Si IV column densities, ~1.6 for O VI, and ~1.7 for C IV. We show that
these systematic uncertainties translate into a systematic uncertainty of up to
a factor of ~3.1 in the Si/C abundance ratio inferred from observations. The
inferred IGM abundance ratio could thus be less than the solar Si/C ratio or
greater than 3 times the solar ratio. If the latter is true, then it suggests
the metagalactic radiation field is not due purely to active galactic nuclei,
but includes a significant stellar component. Lastly, column density ratios of
Si IV to C IV versus C II to C IV are often used to constrain the decrement in
the metagalactic radiation field at the He II absorption edge. We show that the
variation in the predicted Si IV to C IV ratio due to a factor of 2 uncertainty
in the DR rates is almost as large as that due to a factor of 10 change in the
decrement. Laboratory measurements of the relevant DR resonance strengths and
energies are the only unambiguous method to remove the effects of these atomic
physics uncertainties from models of the IGM.

a natural result of the approximately scale free formation process of the
massive halos they inhabit. Although the slope and scatter of the Tully-Fisher

observed zero-point of the relation is inconsistent with simulations of galaxy
formation in Cold Dark Matter universes, a difficulty that can be traced to the

temperature, the dust-to-gas mass ratio and the average grain size. In
addition, we use only distance independent diagrams. With our models, we show
the effect of contamination by atomic lines in the broad band IRAS fluxes

different dust-to-gas mass ratios exist, so that the dust content is a
primordial parameter for the interpretation of far infrared data of planetary
nebulae. In contrast with previous studies, we find no evidence for a decrease
in the dust-to-gas mass ratio as the planetary nebulae evolve. We also show
that the decrease in grain size advocated by Natta and Panagia (1981, ApJ

point-particles in a turbulent convective flow with given correlations to a
polymer or membrane. In analogy to the passive scalar problem we call this the
passive polymer or membrane problem. We shall focus on the expansion about the
marginal limit of velocity-velocity correlations which are uncorrelated in time
and grow with the distance x as |x|^epsilon, and epsilon small. This relation
gets modified for polymers and membranes (the marginal advecting flow has
correlations which are shorter ranged.) The construction is done in three
steps: First, we reconsider the treatment of the passive scalar problem using
the most convenient treatment via field theory and renormalization group. We
explicitly show why IR-divergences and thus the system-size appear in physical
observables. In a second step, we reformulate the problem in terms of a
Langevin equation. This is not only interesting in its own, but also gives an
efficient algorithm to determine S^{2n} numerically. In a third and final step,
we generalize the Langevin treatment of a particle to polymers and membranes,
or more generally to an elastic object of inner dimension D with 0 <= D <= 2.
These objects can intersect each other. We also analyze what happens when
self-intersections are no longer allowed.

of the field description for a superconductor in terms of a U(1) spontaneous

fluid and the force acting on vortices in the fluid, which is a generalization
of the well-known flat space-time Magnus force. To clarify the development we
include the explicit discussion of two particular cases, one of them of

low-energy fields in a foamlike spacetime, with involved topology at the Planck
scale but with a smooth metric structure at large length scales, as follows.
Quantum gravitational fluctuations may induce a minimum length thus introducing
an additional source of uncertainty in physics. The existence of this
resolution limit casts doubts on the metric structure of spacetime at the
Planck scale and opens a doorway to nontrivial topologies, which may dominate
Planck scale physics. This foamlike structure of spacetime may show up in
low-energy physics through loss of quantum coherence and mode-dependent energy
shifts, for instance, which might be observable. Spacetime foam introduces
nonlocal interactions that can be modeled by a quantum bath, and low-energy
fields evolve according to a master equation that displays such effects.
Similar laws are also obtained for quantum mechanical systems evolving
according to good real clocks, although the underlying Hamiltonian structure in
this case establishes serious differences among both scenarios. Contents.---

probability following a nontrivial and nonpoissonian distribution on an event
by event basis. DCCs might then be identified experimentally by inspecting
higher order factorial cumulants $\theta_m$ ($m\ge 3$) in the sampled

decays are studied within the framework of the effective Hamiltonian approach
in conjunction with generalized factorization for hadronic matrix elements. We
identify two principal sources responsible for the enhancement of A0/A_2: the
vertex-type as well as penguin-type corrections to the matrix elements of
four-quark operators, which render the physical amplitude renormalization-scale
and -scheme independent, and the nonfactorized effect due to soft-gluon
exchange, which is needed to suppress the $\Delta I=3/2$ $K\to\pi\pi$
amplitude. Contrary to the chiral approach which is limited to light meson
decays and fails to reproduce the A2 amplitude, the aforementioned approach for
dealing with scheme and scale issues is applicable to heavy meson decays. We
obtain A0/A2=13-15 if $m_s$(1 GeV) lies in the range (125-175)MeV. The bag
parameters $B_i$, which are often employed to parametrize the scale and scheme
dependence of hadronic matrix elements, are calculated in two different
renormalization scehemes. It is found that $B_8^{(2)}$ and $ B_6^{(0)}$, both
of order 1.5 at $\mu=1$ GeV, are nearly $\gamma_5$ scheme independent, whereas
$B^{(0)}_{3,5,7}$ as well as $B_7^{(2)}$ show a sizable scheme dependence.
Moreover, only $B_{1,3,4}^{(0)}$ exhibit a significant $m_s$ dependence, while
the other $B$-parameters are almost $m_s$ independent. For direct CP violation,
we obtain $\epsilon'/\epsilon=(0.7-1.1)\times 10^{-3}$ if $m_s(1 {\rm

with novel bounds when gravity dominates. In particular, it remains valid in

enables us to make a one-to-one correspondence beween the supergravity moduli

of the splitting of the D1/D5 system into subsystems and show that it agrees
with supergravity. We have shown that the fixed scalars of the D1/D5 system
couple only to (2,2) operators thus removing earlier discrepancies between
D-brane calculations and semiclassical calculations. The absorption
cross-section of the minimal scalars is determined from first principles upto a
propotionality constant. We show that the absorption cross-section of the
minimal scalars computed in supergravity and the SCFT is independent of the

on the zeros of Dirichlet L-functions mod q, that the set of positive real
numbers x for which these inequalities hold has positive (logarithmic) density
delta_{q;a_1,dots,a_r} > 0. They also discovered the surprising fact that a
certain distribution associated with these densities is not symmetric under
permutations of the residue classes a_j in general, even if the a_j are all
squares or all nonsquares mod q (a condition necessary to avoid obvious biases
of the type first observed by Chebyshev). This asymmetry suggests, contrary to
prior expectations, that the densities delta_{q;a_1,dots,a_r} themselves vary
under permutations of the a_j.
  In this paper, we derive (under the hypotheses used by Rubinstein and Sarnak)
a general formula for the densities delta_{q;a_1,dots,a_r}, and we use this
formula to calculate many of these densities when q <= 12 and r <= 4. For the
special moduli q = 8 and q = 12, and for {a_1,a_2,a_3} a permutation of the
nonsquares {3,5,7} mod 8 and {5,7,11} mod 12, respectively, we rigorously bound
the error in our calculations, thus verifying that these densities are indeed
asymmetric under permutation of the a_j. We also determine several situations
in which the densities delta_{q;a_1,dots,a_r} remain unchanged under certain
permutations of the a_j, and some situations in which they are provably
different.

analysis of these data with existing antiprotonic atom data allows, for the
first time, the imaginary parts of the S-wave scattering lengths for the two
nuclei to be extracted. The obtained values are: $Im a^{sc}_0 = [- 0.62 \pm

0.36\pm 0.03({stat})^{+0.19}_{-0.11}({sys})] fm$ for $\bar{p}^4$He. This
analysis indicates an unexpected behaviour of the imaginary part of the
$\bar{p}$-nucleus S-wave scattering length as a function of the atomic weight

dinuclear systems are compared with the corresponding quantities of strongly
deformed nuclei. As dinuclear system we denote two touching nuclei (clusters).
It is found that the hyperdeformed states of nuclei are close to those of
nearly symmetric dinuclear systems, whereas the superdeformed states are
considered as states of asymmetric dinuclear systems. The superdeformed and
hyperdeformed states constructed from two touching clusters have large octupole
deformations. The experimental measurement of octupole deformation of the
highly deformed nuclei can answer whether these nuclei have cluster
configurations as described by the dinuclear model.

theory methods. We dwell on the WKB approximation in the functional integral
which is analogous to the Wyld functional integral in turbulence. The main
contribution to statistics is due to a coupled field-force configuration. This
configuration is related to a kink between metastable exact pole solutions of
the Syvashinsky equation. These kinks are responsible for both the formation of
new cusps and the rapid power-law acceleration of the mean flame-front. The
problem of asymptotic stability of the solutions is discussed.

several input systems which have been subject to the same noise. The purity of
the outputs generally increases with the number of input systems, and decreases
with the number of required output systems. We construct the optimal quantum
operations for this task, and discuss their asymptotic behaviour as the number
of inputs goes to infinity. The rate at which output systems may be generated
depends crucially on the type of purity requirement. If one tests the purity of
the outputs systems one at a time, the rate is infinite: this fidelity may be
made to approach 1, while at the same time the number of outputs goes to
infinity arbitrarily fast. On the other hand, if one also requires the
correlations between outputs to decrease, the rate is zero: if fidelity with
the pure product state is to go to 1, the number of outputs per input goes to
zero. However, if only a fidelity close to 1 is required, the optimal purifier
achieves a positive rate, which we compute.

clarify the difference, we describe the quantum dynamics by deterministic rigid
trajectories, which are accompanied with the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of
quantum mechanics, instead of wave functions. A bundle of quantum trajectories
