YLW15. The flares occurred every ~20 hours and showed an exponential decay with
time constant 30-60 ks. The X-ray spectra are explained by a thin thermal
plasma emission. The plasma temperature shows a fast-rise and slow-decay for
each flare with kT_{peak}~4-6 keV. The emission measure of the plasma shows
this time profile only for the first flare, and remains almost constant during
the second and third flares at the level of the tail of the first flare. The
peak flare luminosities L_{X,peak} were ~5-20 * 10^{31} erg s^{-1}, which are
among the brightest X-ray luminosities observed to date for Class I protostars.
The total energy released in each flare was 3-6*10^{36} ergs. The first flare
is well reproduced by the quasi-static cooling model, which is based on solar
flares, and it suggests that the plasma cools mainly radiatively, confined by a
semi-circular magnetic loop of length ~14 Ro with diameter-to-length ratio
\~0.07. The two subsequent flares were consistent with the reheating of the
same magnetic structure as of the first flare. The large-scale magnetic
structure and the periodicity of the flares imply that the reheating events of
the same magnetic loop originate in an interaction between the star and the
disk due to the differential rotation.

calculated MARCS stellar atmosphere models and SSG synthetic spectra of these
cool stars, adjusting the band absorption oscillator strengths of the TiO bands
to better reproduce the observational data. The resulting synthetic spectra are
found to be in very good agreement with the K-band spectra of stars of the
appropriate spectral type taken from Kleinmann & Hall (1986) as well. Spectral
types estimated from the strengths of the TiO bands and the depth of the
bandhead of CO near 2.3 microns quantitatively confirm that the synthetic
spectra are good representations of those of field M giants. The broad-band
colors of the models match the field relations of K and early-M giants very
well; for late-M giants, differences between the field-star and synthetic
colors are probably caused by the omission of spectral lines of VO and water in
the spectrum synthesis calculations. Here, we present four grids of K-band

Saturn and about five Jupiter masses between Jupiter and Uranus. Unless all but
a Jupiter mass of the outer disk was removed, Jupiter would have migrated into

to remove the outer disk except for photo-evaporation which might work exterior
to Saturn. For extra-solar Jupiters at an AU or less from the central star,
photo-evaporation would not remove the outer disk. We propose a new mechanism,

show that magnetic fields can dissipate on a timescale of order

local-field (LF) and the quasi-particle (QP) corrections to the calculated
dielectric function obtained using the local density approximation (LDA). We
found that while the QP corrections tend to align the calculated structures in
the optical spectra with their experimental counterparts, the LF effects don't
change these peak positions but systematically reduce the intensities of the so
called $E_1$ and $E_2$ structures in all the optical spectra. The reduction of
the intensity of the $E_1$ peak worsen the agreement with experiment while that
of $E_2$ improves it. We then show that the local-field correction improves
considerably the calculated static dielectric constants of all studied
semiconductors.
  Because the static dielectric constant is a ground state property, the
remaining discrepancy with experiment should be attributed to the the LDA
itself. On the other hand, as expected, the calculation of the static
dielectric constant using the GW quasiparticle energies and including the LF
effects is underestimated for all the semiconductors. The excitonic effects
should then correct for this discrepancy with experiment.

quantitatively the approach of a Wigner distribution to a Gaussian form for

acceptance of constraint-based analyses of prosodic morphology phenomena such
as truncation, infixation, floating morphemes and reduplication. Of these,
reduplication is particularly challenging for state-of-the-art computational
morphology, since it involves copying of some part of a phonological string. In
this paper I argue for certain extensions to the one-level model of phonology
and morphology (Bird & Ellison 1994) to cover the computational aspects of
prosodic morphology using finite-state methods. In a nutshell, enriched lexical
representations provide additional automaton arcs to repeat or skip sounds and
also to allow insertion of additional material. A kind of resource
consciousness is introduced to control this additional freedom, distinguishing
between producer and consumer arcs. The non-finite-state copying aspect of
reduplication is mapped to automata intersection, itself a non-finite-state
operation. Bounded local optimization prunes certain automaton arcs that fail
to contribute to linguistic optimisation criteria. The paper then presents
implemented case studies of Ulwa construct state infixation, German
hypocoristic truncation and Tagalog over-applying reduplication that illustrate
the expressive power of this approach, before its merits and limitations are
discussed and possible extensions are sketched. I conclude that the one-level
approach to prosodic morphology presents an attractive way of extending
finite-state techniques to difficult phenomena that hitherto resisted elegant
computational analyses.

the multi-field curvature scaling solution is the global late-time attractor

multi-field models with exponential potentials are non-negligible in late-time
behaviour, contrary to what is commonly believed. The early-time and
intermediate behaviour of the models is also studied. In particular, n-scalar
field models are investigated and the structure of the saddle equilibrium
points corresponding to inflationary m-field scaling solutions and
non-inflationary m-field matter scaling solutions are also studied (where m<n),
leading to interesting transient dynamical behaviour with new physical

presence of the inhomogeneous term in the evolution equations for quark
distribution functions of the photon implies important difference in the way
factorization mechanism works in photon-hadron and photon-photon collisions as
compared to the hadronic ones. Moreover, a careful definitions of the very
concepts of the ``leading order'' and ``next-to-leading order'' QCD analysis of
F_2^{\gamma} are needed in order to separate genuine QCD effects from those of
pure QED origin. After presenting such definitions, I show that all existing
allegedly LO, as well as NLO analyses of F_2^{\gamma}(x,Q^2) are incomplete.
The source of this incompleteness of the conventional approach is traced back
to the lack of clear identification of QCD effects and to the misinterpretation
of the behaviour of q^{\gamma}(x,M) as a function of \alpha_s(M). Complete LO
and NLO QCD analyses of F_2^{\gamma}(x,Q^2) are shown to differ substantially

requires analyzing the cancellation of triangle gauge anomalies on the

that the semi-simple part of the orbifold gauge groups and certain U(1)
symmetries have to be free of quantum anomalies. In addition there can be
several anomalous U(1) symmetries on each orbifold plane whose anomalies are
cancelled by a non-trivial variation of the bulk vector fields. The mixed U(1)
non-abelian anomaly is universal and there is at most one U(1) symmetry with
such an anomaly on each plane. In an alternative approach, we also analyze the
coupling of five-dimensional gauged supergravity to orbifold gauge theories. We
find a somewhat generalized structure of anomaly cancellation in this case

cancellation from the perspective of four-dimensional N=1 effective actions

distribution is not time covariant. The procedure is generalized by using other
phase-space quasi-distributions, and sufficient conditions are provided for
time covariance that limit the possible phase-space quasi-distributions
essentially to the Wigner function, which, however, provides a non-positive TOA
quasi-distribution. These problems are remedied with a different quantization
procedure which, on the other hand, does not guarantee normalization. Finally
an Arthurs and Kelly measurement model for TOA and energy (valid also for
arbitrary conjugate variables when one of the variables is bounded from below)
is worked out. The marginal TOA distribution so obtained, a distorted version
of Kijowski's distribution, is time covariant, positive, and normalized.

But
suppose that at our disposal we have several copies of an unknown photon. Is it
possible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a
physical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial
polarization state is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same
initial state and the other in some standard polarization state. If this can be
done, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an
unknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning or exactly, by
probabilistic cloning. This might be useful in quantum computation, where one
could store some new information in an already computed state by deleting the
old information. Here we show that the linearity of quantum theory does not
allow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. Though in a
classical computer information can be deleted against a copy, the same task
cannot be accomplished with quantum information.
