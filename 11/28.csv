silicate emission at 10 microns, which is the only prominent feature in the

optically-thin surface layer of the circumstellar disks surrounding the central
young stars (i.e. a disk atmosphere). We report excellent agreement of our
observations with predictions based upon this simple model for most stars in
our sample, assuming that a mixture of amorphous silicates of radius ~< 1
microns is the dominant source of opacity. These observations support the
notion that extended disk atmospheres contribute substantially to the mid-IR

flavor-oscillation clock, which is immersed in a gravitational field, is
subject to a continuous quantum measurement. Afterwards, resorting to the weak
equivalence principle, we obtain the corresponding quantities in a freely
falling reference frame. Finally, comparing this last result with the
measurement outputs that would appear in a Minkowskian spacetime it will be
found that they do not coincide, in other words, we have a violation of
Einstein equivalence principle. This violation appears in two different forms,
namely: (i) the oscillation frequency in a freely falling reference frame does
not match with the case predicted by general relativity, a feature previously
obtained by Ahluwalia; (ii) the probability distribution of the measurement
outputs, obtained by an observer in a freely falling reference frame, does not
coincide with the results that would appear in the case of a Minkowskian
spacetime.
