  follows",,"10.1086/308649",,"astro-ph",,"  We have calculated nonthermal bremsstrahlung (NTB) models for the hard X-ray
(HXR) tails recently observed by BeppoSAX in clusters of galaxies. In these
models, the HXR emission is due to suprathermal electrons with energies of
about 10-200 keV. Under the assumption that the suprathermal electrons form
part of a continuous spectrum of electrons including highly relativistic
particles, we have calculated the inverse Compton (IC) extreme ultraviolet
(EUV), HXR, and radio synchrotron emission by the extensions of the same
populations. For accelerating electron models with power-law momentum spectra
(N[p] propto p^{- mu}) with mu <~ 2.7, which are those expected from strong
shock acceleration, the IC HXR emission exceeds that due to NTB. Thus, these
models are only of interest if the electron population is cut-off at some upper
energy <~1 GeV. Similarly, flat spectrum accelerating electron models produce
more radio synchrotron emission than is observed from clusters if the ICM
magnetic field is B >~ 1 muG. The cooling electron model produces vastly too
much EUV emission as compared to the observations of clusters. We have compared
these NTB models to the observed HXR tails in Coma and Abell 2199. The NTB
models require a nonthermal electron population which contains about 3% of the
number of electrons in the thermal ICM. If the suprathermal electron population
is cut-off at some energy above 100 keV, then the models can easily fit the
observed HXR fluxes and spectral indices in both clusters. For accelerating
electron models without a cutoff, the electron spectrum must be rather steep >~
2.9.

images of distant galaxies through weak gravitational lensing effects. This
provides an efficient probe of the cosmological parameters and of the density
field. In this article, we investigate the statistical properties of the
convergence due to weak gravitational lensing by non-linear structures (i.e. we
consider small angular windows $\theta \la 1'$). Previous studies have shown
how to relate the second and third order moments of the convergence to those of
the density contrast while models based on the Press-Schechter prescription
provide an estimate of the tail of $P(\kappa)$. Here we present a method to
obtain an estimate of the full p.d.f. of the convergence $P(\kappa)$. It is
based on a realistic description of the density field which applies to
overdense as well as underdense regions. We show that our predictions agree
very well with the results of N-body simulations for the convergence. This
could allow one to derive the cosmological parameters
$(\Omega_m,\Omega_{\Lambda})$ as well as the full p.d.f. $P(\delta_R)$ of the
density contrast itself in the non-linear regime from observations. Hence this
gives a very powerfull tool to constrain scenarios of structure formation.

have conspicuous amplitude variations. 14 photometric terms have been also
detected in the radial velocity curve or in the analysis of the line profile
variations. There are no spectroscopic terms without photometric counterparts,
and this means that there are no high--degree modes as observed in other delta
Scuti stars. The simultaneous fit of light and line profile variations has
allowed the estimation of the inclination of rotational axis (about 70 deg.)
and the l,m identification for many modes. In particular there is clear
evidence that the two shortest period modes are retrograde. Rather reliable
results were found for the dominant mode which has l=1, m=-1. The resulting
physical parameters of its pulsation are in good agreement with the prediction

photometry to select candidates, followed by multi-slit spectroscopy through
the same narrow-band filter to limit the bandpass and allow a dense packing of
slits. The second uses six parallel long slits to carry out a blind
spectroscopic search through the filter isolating the 9150 A window. The total
slit area covered ranges from 1 to 3.5 square arcmin per pointing, depending on
slit width, and we can obtain 3-sigma detections of emission lines of <2 x
10^-18 erg/cm^2/s in a 12000 s observation with 1.5 arcsec slits.
  Because, for faint objects in both programs, we are most sensitive to strong
lines with large equivalent widths, most of our detections will be restricted
to a few specific emission lines at certain discrete redshifts. One of the more
interesting possibilities is Ly-alpha at z~6.5. However, even with 12000 s
integrations on the Keck II telescope, our narrow-band imaging does not pick up
objects with emission-line fluxes less than 10^-17 erg/cm^2/s. With this limit,
at z~6.5, we would pick up only the most luminous of the z>5 objects discovered
so far. Our blind spectroscopic search potentially has a better chance of
discovering such objects, but we have not yet found any definite examples in
the limited area of the sky we have covered to date. We discuss the criteria

high-ionization dwarf galaxies at low redshift can be mistaken for Ly-alpha

of dense concentrations of neutral gas in halos with circular velocity v_c
roughly 140 km/s for Omega_m=1 and 90 km/s for Omega_m=0.4, at z=2; an
additional LCDM simulation resolves halos down to v_c approximately 50 km/s at
z=3. We find a clear relation between HI column density and projected distance
to the center of the nearest galaxy, with DLA absorption usually confined to
galactocentric radii less than 10-15 kpc and LL absorption arising out to
projected separations of 30 kpc or more. Detailed examination provides evidence
of non-equilibrium effects on absorption cross-section. If we consider only
absorption in the halos resolved by our standard simulations, then all five
models fall short of reproducing the observed abundance of DLA and LL systems
at these redshifts. If we extrapolate to lower halo masses, we find all four
models are consistent with the observed abundance of DLA systems if the the
extrapolated behavior extends to circular velocities roughly 50-80 km/s, and
they may produce too much absorption if the relation continues to 40 km/s. Our
results suggest that LL absorption is closely akin to DLA absorption, arising
in less massive halos or at larger galactocentric radii but not caused by
processes acting on a radically different mass scale.

associated with young supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent X-ray observations of
young remnants have revealed slowly rotating (P ~ 10-s) central pulsars with
pulsed emission above 2 keV, lacking in detectable radio emission. Some of
these objects apparently have enormous magnetic fields, evolving in a manner
distinct from the Crab pulsar. We argue that these X-ray pulsars can account
for a substantial fraction of the long sought after neutron stars in SNRs and
that Crab-like pulsars are perhaps the rarer, but more highly visible example
of these stellar embers. Magnetic field decay likely accounts for their high
X-ray luminosity, which cannot be explained as rotational energy loss, as for
the Crab-like pulsars. We suggest that the natal magnetic field strength of
these objects control their subsequent evolution. There are currently almost a
dozen slow X-ray pulsars associated with young SNRs. Remarkably, these objects,
taken together, represent at least half of the confirmed pulsars in supernova
remnants. This being the case, these pulsars must be the progenitors of a vast
population of previously unrecognized neutron stars.

1999. Special emphasis of our analysis was on the observations taken during the
initial rise of the flux and during the maximum of the outburst. The maximum of
the outburst was divided into three plateaus, with almost constant flux within
each plateau, and fast jumps between them. The spectral and timing parameters
are stable for each individual plateau, but distinctly different between the
plateaus. The variability detected on the first plateau is of special interest.
During these observations the source exhibits quasi-regular modulations with
period of ~10 - 20 s. Our analysis revealed significant differences in spectral
and temporal behavior of the source at high and low fluxes during this period
of time. The source behavior can be generally explained in the framework of the
two-phase model of the accretion flow, involving a hot inner comptonization
region and surrounding optically thick disk. The variability and spectral
evolution of the source were similar to what was observed earlier for other
X-ray Novae. We show that 4U 1630-47 has a variety of properties which are

of varying radial depth. The corresponding theoretical error calculation takes
into account all sources of statistical error on the measurement of the
moments, and is in good agreement with the dispersion over mock redshift
catalogues. The errors that we find on S_3 and S_4 are larger than those quoted
in previous studies, in spite of the fact that the surveys we consider cover
larger volumes. S_3 varies little with cell size, with values in the range
1.8-2.2 and errors ~20%, for cubical cells of side 3-20 h^{-1}Mpc. Direct
measurements of S_3 are possible out to ~35 h^{-1}Mpc, though with larger
errors. A significant determination of S_4 is only possible for one scale, l=6
h^{-1}Mpc, with S_4~5. We compare our results with theoretical predictions from
N-body simulations of cold dark matter universes. Qualitatively, the skewness
of the dark matter has the same form as that of the galaxies. However, the
amplitude of the galaxy S_3 is lower than that predicted for the dark matter.
Our measurements of S_3 are consistent with the predictions of a simple model
in which initially Gaussian fluctuations in the dark matter evolve
gravitationally, if a second order bias term is specified, in addition to the

confirmed cluster members with deep WFPC2 imaging. A surprisingly large number
of these cluster members are mergers: 13 out of 77 galaxies are classified as
merger remnants, or mergers in progress. Most of these are red, and massive.
Their restframe B luminosities are amongst the brightest in the cluster: we
find that 5 out of the brightest 16 are mergers. No such bright mergers were
found in a lower redshift cluster with similar wide field coverage. The mergers
in MS1054-03 are preferentially found in the outskirts of the cluster. The
distribution of pairs in the outskirts of the cluster shows an excess of
galaxies with separation < 10 h^-1 kpc, which is independent confirmation of
the enhanced interaction rate. The fraction of mergers (17 %) is comparable to
the fraction of ellipticals (22 %). Hence up to 50 % of low redshift
ellipticals may have formed through mergers since z=1. There is no evidence for
strong star formation in most of the mergers. The mean stellar ages of the
mergers may therefore be much older than the ``assembly age'', i.e., the age
since the time the system was put together. These new results are qualitatively
consistent with predictions from hierarchical galaxy formation, and are
inconsistent with an early collapse for all early type galaxies.

phenomenology has been advanced, in which energy dissipation is by means of
avalanches which do not have an intrinsic scale. This may in turn imply that
the system is in a self organised critical (SOC) state. Indicators of internal
processes are consistent with this, examples are the power law dependence of
the power spectrum of auroral indices, and in-situ magnetic field observations
in the earth's geotail.
  An apparent paradox is that, rather than power laws, substorm statistics
exhibit probability distributions with characteristic scales. Here we discuss a
simple sandpile model which yields for energy discharges due to internal
reorganization a probability distribution that is a power law, whereas
systemwide discharges (flow of ""sand"" out of the system) form a distinct group
whose probability distribution has a well defined mean.
  We analyse the model over a wide dynamic range whereupon two regimes having
different inverse power law statistics emerge, corresponding to
reconfigurations over two distinct scaling regions: short scale sizes sensitive
to the discrete nature of the sandpile model, and long scale sized up to the
system size which correspond to the continuous limit of the model. The latter
are anticipated to correspond to large scale systems such as the magnetosphere.
  Since the energy inflow may be highly variable, we examined the response of
the model under strong or variable loading and established that the power law
signature of the large scale internal events persists. The interval
distribution of these events is also discussed.

one to determine the low-mass stellar IMF at large look-back times and thus at
high redshift. We present the faint stellar luminosity function (based on
optical HST data) in an external galaxy, the Ursa Minor dwarf Spheroidal

metallicity, remarkably similar to that of a classical halo globular cluster

clusters, the internal velocity dispersion of the Ursa Minor dSph indicates the
presence of significant amounts of dark matter. We find that the main sequence

0.4 of a solar mass is indistinguishable from that of the halo globular
clusters M92 and M15. Thus the low mass stellar IMF for stars that formed at

Because of mathematical complexity, however, very few works have been reported
for substitutional alloys. In this work, coherency-induced ordering in
substitutional alloys is examined through a simple model based on a
two-dimensional square lattice. Within the assumption of nearest neighbor
interactions on a square lattice, both modified Bragg-Williams and Onsager
approaches show that coherency strain arising due to atomic mismatch can exert
profound effects on order-disorder transitions in substitutional alloys. If the
alloy system is elastically homogeneous and Vegard's law is obeyed, the
order-disorder transition is of a second-order kinetics. If the atomic
mismatches significantly deviate from Vegard's law, however, the transition may
become a first-order kinetics, as the configurational free energy surface is
composed of double wells. At the transition of a first-order kinetics, the
lattice parameter can either increase or decrease upon heating, i.e., the
lattice parameter of an ordered state can be less or greater than that of a
disordered state. The results of Onsager's approach are independently confirmed
with those of the Discrete Atom Method, a Monte Carlo technique predicated upon
the combination of statistical mechanics and linear elasticity.

  Temperature","39 pages of Revtex. 1 figure",,"10.1088/0953-4075/33/19/303",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  In this paper we develop a gapless theory of BEC which can be applied to both
trapped and homogeneous gases at zero and finite temperature. The many-body
Hamiltonian for the system is written in a form which is approximately
quadratic with higher order cubic and quartic terms. The quadratic part is
diagonalized exactly by transforming to a quasiparticle basis, while the
non-quadratic terms are dealt with using first and second order perturbation
theory. The conventional treatment of these terms, based on factorization
approximations, is shown to be inconsistent.
  Infra-red divergences can appear in individual terms of the perturbation
expansion, but we show analytically that the total contribution beyond
quadratic order is finite. The resulting excitation spectrum is gapless and the
energy shifts are small for a dilute gas away from the critical region,
justifying the use of perturbation theory. Ultra-violet divergences can appear
if a contact potential is used to describe particle interactions. We show that
the use of this potential as an approximation to the two-body T-matrix leads
naturally to a high-energy renormalization.
  The theory developed in this paper is therefore well-defined at both low and
high energy and provides a systematic description of Bose-Einstein condensation
in dilute gases. It can therefore be used to calculate the energies and decay
rates of the excitations of the system at temperatures approaching the phase
transition.

formal system were not defined in his time, but Descartes' method may be
understood as seeking certainty in essentially the same way.
  In this article, I explain formal systems as concrete artifacts, and
investigate the way in which they provide a high level of certainty---arguably
the highest level achievable by rational discourse. The rich understanding of
formal systems achieved by mathematical logic and computer science in this

scalar-tensor theories of gravitation as a theoretical basis of quintessence.
One of the advantages of appealing to these theories is that they allow us to
implement the scenario of a ``decaying cosmological constant,'' which offers a
reasonable understanding of why the observed upper bound of the cosmological
constant is smaller than the theoretically natural value by as much as 120
orders of magnitude. In this context, the scalar field can be a candidate of
quintessence in a broader sense. We find, however, a serious drawback in the
prototype Brans-Dicke model with $\Lambda$ added; a static universe in the
physical conformal frame which is chosen to have constant particle masses. We
propose a remedy by modifying the matter coupling of the scalar field taking
advantage of scale invariance and its breakdown through quantum anomaly. By
combining this with a conjecture on another cosmological constant problem
coming from the vacuum energy of matter fields, we expect a possible link
between quintessence and non-Newtonian gravity featuring violation of Weak
Equivalence Principle and intermediate force range, likely within the
experimental constraints. A new prediction is also offered on the
time-variability of the gravitational constant.

emits takes a long time to reach us traveling around the fold. Hence dark
matter is microphysically identical to ordinary matter; it can dissipate and
clump possibly forming dark replicas of ordinary stars which are good MACHO
candidates. Its dissipation may lead to far more frequent occurrence of
gravitational collapse and consequently to a significant enhancement in
gravitational wave signals detectable by LIGO and LISA. Sterile neutrinos find
a natural home on the other folds. Since the folded brane is not a BPS state,
it gives a new geometric means for supersymmetry breaking in our world. It may
also offer novel approach for the resolution of the cosmological horizon
problem, although it still requires additional dynamics to solve the flatness
problem. Although there are constraints from BBN, structure formation, the
enormity of galactic halos and the absence of stars and globular clusters with
a discernible dark matter component, we show that the model is consistent with
current observational limits. It presents us with a new dark matter particle

as epileptic seizures, lies on the characterisation of the dynamics of the
neural networks. The theory of non-linear dynamics provides signal analysis
techniques which may give new information on the behaviour of such networks.
Methods: We calculated correlation dimension maps for 19-channel EEG data from
3 patients with a total of 7 absence seizures. The signals were analysed
before, during and after the seizures. Phase randomised surrogate data was used
to test chaos. Results: In the seizures of two patients we could distinguish
two dynamical regions on the cerebral cortex, one that seemed to exhibit chaos
whereas the other seemed to exhibit noise. The pattern shown is essentially the
same for seizures triggered by hyperventilation, but differ for seizures
triggered by light flashes. The chaotic dynamics that one seems to observe is
determined by a small number of variables and has low complexity. On the other
hand, in the seizures of another patient no chaotic region was found. Before
and during the seizures no chaos was found either, in all cases. Conclusions:
The application of non-linear signal analysis revealed the existence of
differences in the spatial dynamics associated to absence seizures. This may
contribute to the understanding of those seizures and be of assistance in
clinical diagnosis.

a structural artifact, but of pure biological advantage. The possibility of the
existence of a phenomenon of a special mode of interaction, labeled as ""chiral
interaction"" (CI), for which structural chirality is a necessary condition, is
the main reason for such an advantage. In order to demonstrate such a
possibility, macroscopic chiral devices are introduced and presented as
analogies for such an interaction. For this purpose it is important to make a
clear distinction between geometric and physical chiralities, where the latter
are capable to perform chiral interactions with various media. Apart from
chirality, a few other structural elements are required. In particular, the
presence of an interface that separates between the chiral device and the
medium with which it is interacting. The physical chirality is build into this
very interface where chiral interaction is taking place. On a molecular level,
soluble proteins in particular, the active medium is the presence of random
ionic motion in the aqueous solvent. As a result of chiral interaction a
certain perturbation, or current, is generated and flowing along the coils of $
\alpha$-helix structure in one preferred direction out of two possible ones. A
model for such a chiral interaction is presented and a few significant
consequences are pointed out. In particular, it is important to emphasize the
time-irreversible feature of chiral interaction, which leads to its non-ergodic
nature that is to be considered a necessary condition for evolutionary
processes in biomolecules. There exists an experimental result by Careri et al.

through two uses of a noisy quantum channel, which is modeled by the action of
a completely positive trace-preserving (or stochastic) map. We provide strong
support for the conjecture that this minimal entropy is additive, namely that
the minimum entropy can be achieved when product states are transmitted.
Explicitly, we prove that for a tensor product of two unital stochastic maps on
qubit states, using an entanglement that involves only states which emerge with
minimal entropy cannot decrease the entropy below the minimum achievable using
product states. We give a separate argument, based on the geometry of the image
of the set of density matrices under stochastic maps, which suggests that the
minimal entropy conjecture holds for non-unital as well as for unital maps. We
also show that the maximal norm of the output states is multiplicative for most
product maps on $n$-qubit states, including all those for which at least one
map is unital.
  For the class of {\it unital} channels on ${\bf C}^2$, we show that
additivity of minimal entropy implies that the Holevo capacity of the channel
is {\it additive} over two inputs, achievable with orthogonal states, and equal
to the Shannon capacity. This implies that superadditivity of the capacity is
possible only for non-unital channels.

relative energy scales of these states. We point out that at zero magnetic
field it is difficult to have both a vanishing double occupation probability

quantum computer operations with small errors. We critically discuss the

method, the molecular orbital method, the Heisenberg model, and the Hubbard
