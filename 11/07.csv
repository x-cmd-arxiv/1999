thirds of the BL Lac images, host galaxies are detected, including nearly all
for z < 0.5 (58 of 63). The highest redshift host galaxy detected is in a BL
Lac object at z=0.664. In 58 of the 72 resolved host galaxies, a de Vaucouleurs
profile is significantly preferred, at >99% confidence, over a pure exponential
disk; the two fits are comparable in the remaining 14 cases. These results
limit the number of disk systems to at most 8% of BL Lacs (at 99% confidence),
and are consistent with all BL~Lac host galaxies being ellipticals. The
detected host galaxies are luminous ellipticals with a median absolute
K-corrected magnitude of M_R= -23.7 +- 0.6 mag, at least one magnitude brighter
than M* and comparable to brightest cluster galaxies. The galaxy morphologies
are generally smooth and undisturbed, with small or negligible ellipticities
(<0.2). There is no correlation between host galaxy and observed nuclear
magnitude or estimated jet power corrected for beaming. If black hole mass is
correlated linearly with bulge mass in general, this implies a large range in
Eddington ratio. Present data strongly support the unification picture with FR

in a uniform electric field. In the standard approach, the (analytically
continued) harmonic oscillator paradigm is important in describing particle
production. However, there is another gauge in which the particle production
process has striking similarities with the one used to describe Hawking
radiation in black holes. The gauge we use to describe the electric field in is
the lightcone gauge, so named because the mode functions for a scalar field are
found to be singular on the lightcone. We use these modes in evaluating the
effective Lagrangian using the proper time technique. The key feature of this
analysis is that these modes can be explicitly ""normalized"" by using the
criterion that they reduce to the usual flat space modes in the limit of the
electric field tending to zero. We find that the proper time kernel is not the
same as the analytically continued oscillator kernel though the effective
Lagrangian is the standard result as it should be. We also consider an example
of a confined electric field system using the lightcone gauge modes. Our
analysis indicates that the Bogolubov coefficients, in taking the limit to the
uniform electric field case, are multiplied by energy dependent boundary
factors that have not been taken into account before.
