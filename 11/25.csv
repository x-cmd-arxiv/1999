  Since the atmospheres of most types of HB stars do not reflect original

Phase-referenced mapping with respect to the geometric center of supernova
1993J enabled us to find, with a standard error of about 600 AU, a stationary
point in the source. We identify this point as the location of the core and the
putative black hole at the gravitational center of the galaxy. The upper bound
on the core's average velocity on the sky is <730 km/s. A short, one-sided jet
extends from the core. The orientation of the jet varies smoothly, with
timescales of about 1yr and an rms of 6degrees about the mean of 50degrees.
Occasionally the jet appears to bend to the east. The length of the jet is only
about 1 mas (3,600 AU), and varies with an rms of about 20%. The inferred
speeds are below 0.08c. The total flux density of the core-jet varies
erratically, changing on occasion by a factor of two over a few weeks, without
any significant changes in the source size and orientation. The inferred
velocity of the plasma flow is >0.25c. The results are consistent with a model
in which plasma condensations with short lifetimes are ejected relativistically
from the core on a timescale of less than a few weeks, and then travel along a
tube whose pattern and geometry are also variable but only on a timescale of
about one year. The central engine of M81 has qualitative similarities to those

Abell 85, and Abell 496 (real galaxies) and a sample of simulated elliptical
galaxies formed in a hierarchical merging scheme (virtual galaxies). We use the
Sersic law to describe their light profile. The specific entropy
(Boltzmann-Gibbs definition) is then calculated supposing that the galaxies
behave as spherical, isotropic, one-component systems. We find that, to a good
approximation (about 10%), both real and virtual galaxies have an almost unique
specific entropy. Within this approximation the galaxies are distributed in a
thin plane in the space defined by the three Sersic law parameters, which we
call the Entropic Plane. A further analysis shows that both real and virtual
galaxies are in fact located on a thin line, therefore indicating the existence
of another - and yet unknown - physical property, besides the uniqueness of the
specific entropy. A more careful examination of the virtual galaxies sample
indicates a very small increase of their specific entropy with merging
generation. In a hierarchical scenario, this implies a correlation between the
specific entropy and the total mass, which is indeed seen in our data. The
scatter and tilt of the Entropic Line, defined by Lima Neto et al. (1999a), are
reduced when this correlation is taken into account. Although one cannot
distinguish between various generations for real galaxies, the distribution of
their specific entropy is similar to that in the virtual sample, suggesting
that hierarchical merging processes could be an important mechanism in the
building of elliptical galaxies.

intracluster medium shows that scattering of the particles due to waves excited
by the instability is possible to reduce mean free paths of electron and ion
down to five to seven order of magnitude than the mean free paths due to
Coulomb collisions. This may provide a hint to explain why hot and cool gas can
co-exist in the intracluster medium in spite of the very short evaporation time
scale due to thermal conduction if the conductivity is the classical Spitzer
value. Our results suggest that the realization of the global thermal
equilibrium is postponed by the local instability which is induced for quicker

suggests that pressure forces have a significant retrograde impact upon the
precession rate (Lubow 1992). We find that the disc precession rates for three

predicted by the dynamical theory, and we attribute the difference to pressure
forces. By assuming that pressure forces of similar magnitude occur in all

distribution of GRBs should track the cosmic star formation rate of massive
stars accurately. A significant proportion of high-mass star formation activity
appears to occur in regions that are obscured from view in the optical waveband
by interstellar dust. The amount of dust-enshrouded star formation activity
taking place has been estimated by observing the thermal radiation from the
dust that has been heated by young stars in the far-infrared and submillimetre
wavebands. Here we discuss an alternative probe - the redshift distribution of
GRBs. GRBs are detectable at the highest redshifts, and because gamma rays are
not absorbed by dust, the redshift distribution of GRBs should therefore be
unaffected by dust extinction. At present the redshifts of GRBs can only be
determined from the associated optical transient emission; however, useful
information about the prevalence of dust-obscured star formation can also be
obtained from the ratio of GRBs with and without an associated optical
transient. Eight GRBs currently have spectroscopic redshifts. Once about a
hundred redshifts are known, the population of GRBs will provide an important

discs driving cold, adiabatic, non-relativistic jets. For the first time, both
the magnetic torque due to the jets and a turbulent ""viscous"" torque are taken
into account. This latter torque allows a dissipation of the accretion power as
radiation at the disc surfaces, while the former predominantly provides jets
with power.
  The parameter space of these structures has been explored. It is
characterized by four free parameters, namely the disc aspect ratio and three
MHD turbulence parameters, related to the anomalous magnetic diffusivities and
viscosity. It turns out that launching cold jets from thin, dissipative discs
implies anisotropic turbulent dissipation. Jets that asymptotically reach a
high Alfvenic Mach number are only produced by weakly dissipative discs.
  We obtained general analytical relations between disc and jet quantities that
must be fulfilled by any steady-state model of cold jets, launched from a large
radial extension of thin discs. We also show that such discs cannot have a
dominant viscous torque. This is because of the chosen geometry, imposing the
locus of the Alfven surface.

consistency of the physical assumptions on which these methods are based. We
applied both the BW and the revised CORS methods to the synthetic light, color

convective models at solar chemical composition. We found that these methods
systematically either underestimate or overestimate ""theoretical"" radii if
radius determinations are based on optical (BVR) bands or on (VJK) bands,
respectively. At the same time, current simulations suggest that CORS radii are
in very good agreement with ""theoretical"" radii if the surface brightness is

spatial infinity can be defined in a natural way via the Hamiltonian framework:
Each conserved quantity is associated with an asymptotic symmetry and the value
of the conserved quantity is defined to be the value of the Hamiltonian which
generates the canonical transformation on phase space corresponding to this
symmetry. However, such an approach cannot be employed to define `conserved
quantities' in a situation where symplectic current can be radiated away (such
as occurs at null infinity in general relativity) because there does not, in
general, exist a Hamiltonian which generates the given asymptotic symmetry.
(This fact is closely related to the fact that the desired `conserved
quantities' are not, in general, conserved!) In this paper we give a
prescription for defining `conserved quantities' by proposing a modification of
the equation that must be satisfied by a Hamiltonian. Our prescription is a
very general one, and is applicable to a very general class of asymptotic
conditions in arbitrary diffeomorphism covariant theories of gravity derivable
from a Lagrangian, although we have not investigated existence and uniqueness
issues in the most general contexts. In the case of general relativity with the
standard asymptotic conditions at null infinity, our prescription agrees with

wormhole. The ``primary effect'' says that the extra matter can afford to be a
part of source or whole source of the wormhole when the wormhole is being
formed. Thus the matter does not affect the stability of wormhole and the
wormhole is still safe. If the extra matter is extotic, it can be the whole
part of the source of the wormhole.
  The ``auxiliary effect'' is that the extra matter plays the role of the
additional matter to the stably-existed wormhole by the other exotic matter.
This additional matter will change the geometry of wormhole enough to prevent
from forming the wormhole by backreaction. In the minimally coupled massless
scalar field case, the self-consistent solution was found. The backreaction of
the scalar field can dominate the exotic matter part so that it will hinder the
formation of the wormhole.

For a first order phase transition, sufficient asymmetry is generated if
viscous effects slow down the heated plasma as it moves away from the black
hole. In our scenario there is no wash-out of the asymmetry after the phase
transition as the plasma rapidly cools to lower temperatures thereby shutting

that the only way to ""flatten"" negative curvature by means of a T-duality is by
introducing an appropriate, non-constant NS-NS B-field. In this paper, we are
investigating this further and ask, whether it is possible to T-dualize AdS_d
space to flat space with some suitably chosen B. To answer this question, we
derive a relationship between the original curvature tensor and the one of the
T-dualized metric involving the B-field. It turns out that there is one
particular component, which is independent of B. By inspection of this
component, we then show, that it is not possible to dualize AdS_d to flat space
irrespective of the choice of B. Finally, we examine the extension of AdS to an
AdS_5 x S^5 geometry and propose a chain of S- and T-dualities together with an
SL(2,Z) coordinate transformation, leading to a dual D9-brane geometry.

(super) symmetry breaking from N=(3, 0) to N=(0, 1) in gauged AdS4
supergravity. Via AdS/CFT correspondence, it is interpreted as renormalization
group flow of strongly coupled three-dimensional field theory with SU(3)*SU(2)
global symmetry. The flow interpolates between N=(0,1) fixed point in the UV to
N=(3,0)fixed point in the IR. Evidences for the interpretation are found both
from critical points of the supergravity scalar potential and from conformal
dimension of relevant chiral primary operators at each fixed point. We also
analyze cases with X7=SO(5)/SO(3)_{max}, V_{5,2}(R), M^{1,1,1}, Q^{1,1,1} and
find that there is no nontrivial renormalization group flows. We extend the
analysis to Englert type vacua of M-theory. By analyzing de Wit-Nicolai
potential, we find that deformation of S7 gives rise to renormalization group
flow from N=8, SO(8) invariant UV fixed point to N=1, G_2 invariant IR fixed
point. For AdS_7 supergravity relevant for near-horizon geometry of coincident

velocity of light in a vacuum in the laboratory frame for photons travelling
between (and perpendicular to) the Casimir plates in a vacuum. The Casimir
plates are two closely spaced, conductive plates, where an attractive force is
observed to exist between the plates called the 'Casimir Force'. We propose
that the velocity of light in a vacuum increases when propagating between two
transparent Casimir Plates. We call this effect the 'Light Velocity Casimir
Effect' or LVC effect. The LVC effect happens because the vacuum energy density
in between the plates is lower than that outside the Casimir plates. The
conductive plates disallow certain frequencies of electrically charged virtual
particles to exist inside the plates, thus lowering the inside vacuum particle
density, compared to the density outside the plates. The reduced (electrically
charged) virtual particle density results in fewer photon scattering events
inside the plates, which should increase the light velocity between the plates
in a vacuum relative to the normal vacuum light speed. A similar effect,
involving light velocity change, occurs when light travels through two
different real material densities; for example when light propagates from water
to air, a process known as optical refraction.

  and extended version, mainly, due to referee's comments. E-mail:
  llf@admin.nsu.ru",,,,"physics.atom-ph physics.optics quant-ph",,"  A method of sideband Raman cooling to the vibrational ground state of the
$m=0$ Zeeman sublevel in a far-detuned two-dimensional optical lattice is
proposed. In our scheme, the Raman coupling between vibrational manifolds of
the adjacent Zeeman sublevels is shifted to the red sideband due to the ac
Stark effect induced by a weak pump field. Thus, cooling and optical pumping to
$m=0$ is achieved by purely optical means with coplanar cw laser beams. The
optical lattice and cooling parameters are estimated in the framework of simple
theoretical models. An application of the transverse sideband cooling method to
frequency standards is discussed. Coherent population trapping for the sideband
Raman transitions between the degenerate vibrational levels is predicted.

a surrounding material medium was introduced by Louis de Broglie in a series of
short notes in 1923 and in a more complete form in his thesis defended in Paris
on the 25th November 1924. This result, recognised by the Nobel Prize in 1929,
gave rise to a major direction of ""new physics"" known today as ""quantum
mechanics"". However, although such notions as ""de Broglie wavelength"" and
""wave-particle duality"" form the basis of the standard quantum theory, it
actually only takes for granted (postulates) the formula for the particle
wavelength and totally ignores the underlying causal, realistic and physically
transparent picture of wave-particle dynamics outlined by Louis de Broglie in
his thesis and further considerably developed in his later works, in the form
of ""double solution"" and ""hidden thermodynamics"" theory. A price to pay for
such rough deviation from the original de Broglian realism and consistency
involves fundamental physics domination by purely abstract and mechanistically
simplified schemes of formal symbols and rules that have led to a deep
knowledge impasse justly described as ""the end of science"". However, a new,
independent approach of ""quantum field mechanics"" (quant-ph/9902015,
quant-ph/9902016, physics/0401164) created within the ""universal science of
complexity"" (physics/9806002) provides many-sided confirmation and natural
completion of de Broglie's ""nonlinear wave mechanics"", eliminating all its
""difficult points"" and reconstituting the causally complete, totally consistent
and intrinsically unified picture of the real, complex micro-world dynamics
directly extendible to all higher levels of unreduced world complexity.
