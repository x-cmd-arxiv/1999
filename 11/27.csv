present now the atlas of optical finding charts and the full description of the

are important for the object classification. New optical/infrared observations
of three of the four unidentified sources show that one source is an AGN and
two sources with an unusually large ratio of X-ray to optical flux have
counterparts in the K'-band suggesting that they are obscured AGNs.
Furthermore, we found evidence from radio emission that the remaining
unidentified source is a powerful radio galaxy (AGN). We thus obtain a 100%
completeness. During the course of our optical identification work, we obtained
optical spectr a of 83 field galaxies, of which 67 were narrow-emission line

Velocity Rotation Curves can be explained in terms of a negative Cosmological
Constant ($\Lambda$). It will be shown that the Cosmological Constant leads to
a velocity contribution proportional to the radii, at large radii, and
depending on the mass of the galaxy. This explanation contrasts with the usual
interpretation that this effect is due to Dark Matter halos. The velocity
rotation curve for the galaxy NGC 3198 will be analysed in detail, while
several other galaxies will be studied superficially. The Cosmological Constant
derived experimentally from the NGC 3198 data was found to be:$|\Lambda|_{Exp}=
5.0\times 10^{-56} cm^{-2}$. This compares favourably with the theoretical
value obtained from the Large Number Hypothesis of:
$|\Lambda|_{Theory}=2.1\times 10^{-56}cm^{-2}$. The Extended LNH is then used
to define other cosmological parameters: gravitational modification constant,
energy density, and the Cosmological Constant in terms of a fundamental length.
A speculative theory for the evolution of the Universe is outlined where it is
shown how the Universe can be defined, in any particular era, by two
parameters: the fundamental length and the energy density of the vacuum for
that epoch. The theory is applied to the time evolution of the universe where a
possible explanation for the $\rho_{Planck}/\rho_{\Lambda}^{QH} \approx
10^{120}$ problem is proposed. The nature of the ''vacuum'' is reviewed along
with a speculative approach for calculating the Cosmological Constant via
formal M-theory.The experimentally derived results presented in this paper
support a decelerating Universe, in contrast with recent indicationsfrom Type
Ia Supernovae experiments, for an accelerating Universe.

HCN (1-0) molecular line emission in NGC 3227 obtained with the IRAM Plateau de
Bure interferometer (PdBI). We achieved an unprecedented angular resolution in
the 12CO(2-1) line of about 0.6'' corresponding to only about 80pc at a
distance of 17.3Mpc. The mapped 12CO emission is concentrated in the inner 8''
and accounts for 20% of the total 30m CO line flux. The 12CO emission is
resolved into an asymmetric nuclear ring with a diameter of about 3''. The HCN
line emission is mostly unresolved at our resolution of ~2.4'' and contains all
of the single dish flux. We have decomposed the observed molecular gas motions
into a circular and non-circular component revealing that about 80% of the gas
in the circum-nuclear region exhibits pure circular rotation. We find evidence
for bar streaming onto the nuclear ring and a redshifted emission knot on the
ring perimeter.
  In the central arcsecond the gas shows apparent counter rotation. This
behavior can be best explained by a warping of the inner molecular gas disk
rather than gas motion in a nuclear bar potential. We detected molecular gas at
a distance from the nucleus of only ~13pc with a velocity of about 75 km/s with
respect to the systemic velocity and find that within the central arcsecond the
rotation curve is rising again. This is the first time that millimetric CO-line
emission has been detected interferometrically at such small distances to the
nucleus of a Seyfert galaxy. These measurements indicate a lower limit on the
enclosed mass of about 2x10^7 M_solar in the inner 15pc.

inner 5'' is resolved into a ring with two bright knots east and west of the
nuclear continuum emission. For the first time in NGC 1068, we can trace
molecular gas at ~0.18'' (13pc) from the nucleus. The high velocities in this
region imply an enclosed mass of ~10^8 M_solar. This value is consistent with a
black hole mass of 1.7x10^7 M_solar plus a contribution from a compact nuclear
stellar cluster. Perpendicular to the kinematic major axis optical images of
NGC1068 show a bright, stellar, oval structure of eccentricity 0.8 and a
deprojected length of 17kpc. Analysis of the rotation curve shows the CO spiral
arms are at the inner Lindblad resonance of this bar-like structure. Inside the
molecular spiral arms the CO kinematic axis changes direction probably in
response to the 2.5kpc (deprojected) long stellar bar seen in the near infrared
(NIR). The low velocity dispersion indicates the molecular gas is in a disk
with a thickness of 10pc in the nuclear region and 100pc in the spiral arms.
  We constructed kinematic models for the molecular gas using elliptical orbits
caused by a ~1'' nuclear bar and using tilted rings resulting in a warp. We
find that the gas motions are consistent with either the warp or the bar
models. However, because there is no evidence for a 1'' nuclear bar in NIR
images, we favor the warp model. A warped CO disk can also explain the
obscuration of the AGN, the extinction of light from the nuclear stellar
cluster, and the observed NIR and mid-IR polarization. The model predicts the
warped CO disk should become edge-on at a radius of 70pc, thereby creating a
cavity for the ionization cone.

$(\Delta < 0)$, the longitudinal correlators of spins at distance $n$ change
sign at a finite temperature $T_0(n,\Delta)$, in reasonable agreement with

explained as an effect of magnetic short-range order which decreases with

approximate the physical gauge degrees of freedom. Simple energetics imply
that, at lattice spacings of order the inverse QCD scale, the effective
light-front Hamiltonian can be expanded in gauge-invariant powers of M: a
colour-dielectric expansion. This leads to a self-consistent constituent
structure of boundstates. We fix the couplings of this expansion by optimising
Lorentz covariance of low-energy eigenfunctions. To lowest non-trivial order of
the expansion, we have found a one-parameter trajectory of couplings that
enhances Lorentz covariance. On this trajectory the masses of nearly-covariant
glueball states exhibit approximate scaling, having values consistent with
large-N extrapolations of continuum results from other methods. There is very
little variation with N in pure Yang-Mills theory: the lightest glueball mass
changes by only a few percent between SU(3) and SU(infinity). The corresponding

gap. However, the quantum cohomology relation
$\sigma^{N-1}={const.}\sigma^{k-1}$ suggests that in addition to the massive
vacua there exists a remaining massless sector in the theory if k>2. We assume
that this massless sector is described by a Landau-Ginzburg (LG) theory of

freely varying in two given submanifolds $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ of a
manifold $\mathcal M$ endowed with a distribution $\mathcal D\subset T\M$. We
give a different proof, that holds in a more general context, of a result by
Bismut (Large Deviations and the Malliavin Calculus, Birkhauser, 1984) stating
that the normal extremizers that are not abnormal are critical points of the
sub-Riemannian action functional. We use the Lagrangian multipliers method in a
Hilbert manifold setting, which leads to a characterization of the abnormal
extremizers (critical points of the endpoint map) as curves where the linear
constraint fails to be regular. Finally, we describe a modification of a result
by Liu and Sussmann that shows the global distance minimizing property of
sufficiently small portions of normal extremizers between a point and a
submanifold.

in terms of the structure of experience, the nature of knowlege and an ethical
aspect related to the identification of authority. Three of these ways of
experiencing the first year are considered to be unproductive in terms of
making sense of physics, while the other three support, to an increasing
degree, the formation of a well-grounded physics knowledge object. Implications
for practice are considered.

leading to cavitation for gas bubbles in liquids. When the mean pressure in the
liquid is reduced to a value below the vapor pressure, the Blake analysis
identifies a critical radius which separates quasistatically stable bubbles
from those which would cavitate. In this work, we analyze the cavitation
threshold for radially symmetric bubbles whose radii are slightly less than the
Blake critical radius, in the presence of time-periodic acoustic pressure
fields. A distinguished limit equation is derived that predicts the threshold
for cavitation for a wide range of liquid viscosities and forcing frequencies.
This equation also yields frequency-amplitude response curves. Moreover, for
fixed liquid viscosity, our study identifies the frequency that yields the
minimal forcing amplitude sufficient to initiate cavitation. Numerical
simulations of the full Rayleigh-Plesset equation confirm the accuracy of these
predictions. Finally, the implications of these findings for acoustic pressure
fields that consist of two frequencies will be discussed.

electromagnetic radiation. The sources, assumed to be monochromatic, are
constructed out of dipoles aligned along a line such that their orientation is
correlated with their position. In one representative example, the dipole
orientations are prescribed by a generalized form of the standard von Mises
distribution for angular variables such that the azimuthal angle of dipoles is
correlated with their position. In another example the tip of the dipole vector
traces a helix around the symmetry axis of the source, thereby modelling the
DNA molecule. We study the polarization properties of the radiation emitted
from such sources in the radiation zone. For certain ranges of the parameters
we find a rather striking angular dependence of polarization. This may find
useful applications in certain biological systems as well as in astrophysical
sources.
