model independent in an accelerating universe. The accelerating behaviour has
lasted at most 0.5 e-folds of expansion assuming a present day value of
$\Omega_Q=2/3$. The generic evolution differs from the exact solution by a
percentage given by $r=2\gm_Q$, with $\gm_Q=(\rho_Q+p_Q)/\rho_Q$. For a small
$\gm_Q$ the evolution remains a good approximation for a long period.
Nucleosynthesis bounds on $\Omega_Q$ suggest that the model independent
solution is valid for at least 12 e-folds of expansion which includes then the
scale of radiation and matter equality. We can, therefore, establish model
independent conditions on the cosmological parameters at some factor scale $a_i
\ll a_o$. Finally, we discuss the relevance of this result to the cosmological
coincidence problem.

and evolution of stars and galaxies. In this review we focus on the metal
deficient galaxies, in particular the most metal-poor ones, because they play a
crucial role in the cosmic scenery. We first set the stage by discussing the
difficult problem of defining a global metallicity and how this quantity can be
measured for a given galaxy. The mechanisms that control the metallicity in a
galaxy are reviewed in detail and involve many aspects of modern astrophysics:
galaxy formation and evolution, massive star formation, stellar winds, chemical
yields, outflows and inflows etc. Because metallicity roughly scales as the
galactic mass, it is among the dwarfs that the most metal-poor galaxies are
found. The core of our paper reviews the considerable progress made in our
understanding of the properties and the physical processes that are at work in
these objects. The question on how they are related and may evolve from one
class of objects to another is discussed. While discussing metal-poor galaxies
in general, we present a more detailed discussion of a few very metal-poor blue
compact dwarf galaxies like IZw18. Although most of what is known relates to
our local universe, we show that it pertains to our quest for primeval galaxies
and is connected to the question of the origin of structure in the universe. We
discuss what QSO absorption lines and known distant galaxies tell us already?
We illustrate the importance of star-forming metal-poor galaxies for the
determination of the primordial helium abundance, their use as distance
indicator and discuss the possibility to detect nearly metal-free galaxies at
high redshift from Ly$\alpha$ emission.

unexpected. The thermal emission from dust is shown in IRAS data and these

astrophysical interest, our new results qualitatively agree with those from the
simpler model: the stellar crust fractures under shear stress at the rotational
equator, matter moves to higher latitudes and the star's oblateness is reduced.
Magnetic stresses favor faults directed toward the magnetic poles. Thus our
previous conclusions concerning the star's spin response still hold; namely,
asymmetric redistribution of matter excites damped precession which could
ultimately lead to an increase in the spin-down torque. Starquakes associated
with glitches could explain the permanent {\em offsets} in period derivative
observed to follow glitches in at least three pulsars.

reaction to infinitesimal perturbations. We recall that one can easily change
the time dependence of observables by applying an infinitesimal force while
time-reparametrization invariant features remain unchanged under the same
perturbations. With the aim of better understanding these properties, we
consider the effect of several baths with different temperatures and
time-scales on the dynamics. This is done in two ways: numerically, by using a
especially developed Monte Carlo algorithm that mimics the coupling to multiple
baths; analytically, by computing the time-dependent probability density of
simple systems in contact with multiple baths. We finally argue that these
features are related to supersymmetry, the reparametrization invariance of the

simulations of the inspiral of binary black holes, if one uses lapse and shift
functions satisfying the ``minimal strain equations'' (MSE), then the

on the very slow inspiral timescale, and the computational demands would thus
be far smaller than for more conventional slicing choices. In this paper, we
derive simple, testable criteria for the MSE to be strongly elliptic, thereby
guaranteeing the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Dirichlet
boundary value problem. We show that these criteria are satisfied in a test-bed
metric for inspiraling binaries, and we argue that they should be satisfied
quite generally for inspiraling binaries. If the local existence and uniqueness
that we have proved holds globally, then, for appropriate boundary values, the
solution of the MSE exhibited by Brady et. al. (which tracks the inspiral and
keeps the metric evolving slowly) will be the unique solution and thus should
be reproduced by (sufficiently accurate and stable) numerical integrations.

construct a lattice version of noncommutative gauge theory. The model is a
discretization of the noncommutative gauge theories that arise from toroidal
compactification of Matrix theory and it includes a recent proposal for a
non-perturbative definition of noncommutative Yang-Mills theory in terms of
twisted reduced models. The model is interpreted as a manifestly star-gauge
invariant lattice formulation of noncommutative gauge theory, which reduces to
ordinary Wilson lattice gauge theory for particular choices of parameters. It
possesses a continuum limit which maintains both finite spacetime volume and
finite noncommutativity scale. We show how the matrix model may be used for
studying the properties of noncommutative gauge theory.

to the fact that F is a transversally projective foliation. A Bott connection

  In the second part special emphasis is put on pion production. Implications
of chiral perturbation theory are discussed. Results based on a specific
meson-exchange model for pion production in nucleon-nucleon collisions are
presented. The model is utilized to calculate several spin-dependent
observables of the reactions $pp \to pp\pi^0$ and $pp \to pn\pi^+$ such as
spin-correlation parameters. This allows us to study the role of the Delta
resonance at close to threshold energies.
  The talk closes with a brief discussion of the production of $\phi$ mesons as
an example for the production of heavier mesons. A strategy is outlined that
allows to extract information on the structure of the nucleon from the reaction
$NN \to NN \phi$.

explanation of the increasing grain temperature in the course of the

As in those papers, a distinction is made between the errors of retrodiction
and prediction. Retrodictive and predictive error relationships are derived.
The POVM describing the outcome of a maximally accurate measurement process is
investigated. It is shown that, if the measurement is retrodictively optimal,
then the distribution of measured values is given by the initial state SU(2)
Q-function. If the measurement is predictively optimal, then the distribution
of measured values is related to the final state SU(2) P-function. The general
form of the unitary evolution operator producing an optimal measurement is
characterised.
