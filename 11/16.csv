Irwin et al. 1989;
Corrigan et al. 1991; Ostensen et al. 1996) has been interpreted in two
different ways; as microlensing by stellar mass objects of a continuum source
having dimensions significantly smaller than the microlens Einstein radius (ER)
(eg. Wambsganss, Paczynski & Schneider 1990; Rauch & Blandford 1991), and as
microlensing by very low mass objects of a source as large as 5 ER (Refsdal &
Stabell 1993; Haugan 1996). In this paper we present evidence in favour of a
small source. Limits on the source size (in units of ER) are obtained from the
combination of limits on the number of microlens Einstein radii crossed by the
source during the monitoring period with two separate light-curve features.
Firstly, recently published monitoring data (Wozniak et al. 2000; OGLE web
page) show large variations (~0.8-1.5 magnitudes) between image brightnesses
over a period of 700 days or ~15% of the monitoring period. Secondly, the 1988
peak in the image A light-curve had a duration that is a small fraction (<0.02)
of the monitoring period. Such rapid microlensing rises and short microlensing
peaks only occur for small sources. We find that the observed large-rapid
variation limits the source size to be <0.2 ER (95% confidence). The width of
the light-curve peak provides a stronger constraint of <0.02 ER (99%
confidence). The Einstein radius (projected into the source plane) of the
average microlens mass (m) in Q2237+0305 is ER ~ 10^{17}\sqrt{m} cm. The
interpretation that stars are responsible for microlensing in Q2237+0305
therefore results in limits on the continuum source size that are consistent
with current accretion disc theory.

South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in the Great Attractor region
(318deg < l < 340deg, |b| <= 10deg, Woudt 1998). This region encompasses the
peak in the reconstructed mass density field, associated with the Great

the Supergalactic Plane with the Galactic Plane.
  We have obtained reliable redshifts for 309 galaxies in the Great Attractor

detector) at the 1.9-m telescope of the SAAO.

massive cluster of galaxies close to the plane of the Milky Way (l,b,v) =

Previous redshift surveys in the GA region have failed to gauge the
significance of the Norma cluster, primarily due to the diminishing effects of
the Galactic foreground extinction on the partially obscured galaxies. In the
absence of the obscuring effects of the Milky Way, the Norma cluster would have
appeared as prominent as the well-known Coma cluster, but nearer in
redshift-space. This cluster most likely marks the bottom of the potential well
of the Great Attractor (Woudt 1998).

observations reveal three peaks lying along a S-shaped gas and dust
distribution. In contrast, the model predicts a circumnuclear ring, not the
observed S-shaped distribution; moreover, the predicted surface density
contrast between the central gas accumulation and the bar dust lanes is an
order of magnitude larger than observed. The discrepancies are not due to
unexplored model parameter space or a nuclear bar but are probably due to the
vigorous (7 solar masses per year) star formation activity in the center.
  As is common in similar bars, the star formation rate in the bar between the
bar ends and the central region is low (~0.5 solar masses per yr), despite the
high gas column density in the bar dust lanes; this is generally attributed to
shear and shocks. We note a tendency for the HII regions to be associated with
the spurs feeding the main bar dust lanes, but these are located on the leading
side of the bar. We propose that stars form in the spurs, which provide a high
column density but low shear environment. HII regions can therefore be found
even on the leading side of the bar because the ionizing stars pass
ballistically through the dust lane

doubly-barred potentials and that they can support the bars in their motion. We
find orbits in which particles remain on loops: closed curves which return to
their original positions after two bars have come back to the same relative
orientation. Stars trapped around stable loops could form the building blocks
for a long-lived, doubly-barred galaxy. Using the loop representation, we can
find which orbits support the bars in their motion, and what are the

particular, it appears that a long-lived secondary bar may exist only when an
Inner Lindblad Resonance is present in the primary bar, and that it would not
extend beyond this resonance.

high-mass WIMPs are captured primarily from bound orbits. WIMP capture would be
eliminated for M_x>630 GeV and would be highly suppressed for M_x>~150 GeV.
Annihilation of captured WIMPs and anti-WIMPs is expected to give rise to

has been used to place limits on WIMP parameters. At present, one does not know

positive physical energy, which is contrary to the folklore belief that the

  (c) To linear order in the mode amplitude, r-modes are subject to the CFS

  (d) Radiation reaction decreases the angular velocity of the shell and causes
differential rotation (which is distinct from but similar in magnitude to the
differential drift reported by Rezzolla et al.) prior to saturation of the
r-mode growth. This is contrary to the phenomenological treatments to date,
which assume that the loss of stellar angular momentum is accounted for by the
r-mode growth. We demonstrate, for the first time, that r-mode radiation
reaction leads to differential rotation.
  (e) We show that for l=2 r-mode electromagnetic radiation reaction is
equivalent to gravitational radiation reaction in the lowest post-Newtonian

developed a combined code which uses pseudo-spectral methods, for the evolution
of the scalar field, and High Resolution Shock-Capturing schemes, for the
evolution of the hydrodynamical system. Although this code has been used to
integrate the field equations of that theory of gravity, in the spherically

this purpose we fitted the spectra of the whole remnant using a new version of
the spectral program SPEX, which takes into account the interdependence of
spectra of different regions as the result of the point spread function of the
instruments. This is in particular important for separating the synchrotron
emission, coming from the bright rims of the remnant, from the thermal emission
from the central regions.
  The thermal emission appears best fitted with a combination of two spectral
components with electron temperatures of about 0.7 keV and more than 3 keV. The
plasma in SN 1006 appears to be very far out of ionization equilibrium (nt = 2
10^15 m^-3 s), which means that the L-shell emission of magnesium, silicon and
sulphur contribute significantly to the flux below 0.5 keV. We also note the
presence of Fe K line emission at 6.3+/-0.2 keV, in agreement with an origin
from inner shell ionizations and excitations. We confirm that the abundances in
SN 1006 are clearly non-solar. In particular silicon is very abundant. We did
not find substantial variations in plasma properties over the face of the
remnant, although the hotter component seems more dominant in the Northern half

several glass-forming liquids. While support is given to the hypothesis
relating the Nagel scaling to multiple relaxation processes, it is also found
that the scaling function may also exhibit plateau regions and does not hold
for low temperatures.

is reviewed, the emphasis being placed on the pivotal ideas and methods
pertaining to perturbative and non-perturbative topics. Specific problems,
related to scale locality, infrared safety, gluonic radiative corrections
(Sudakov effects), and the role of hadronic size effects (intrinsic transverse
momentum), are studied. These issues are more precisely analyzed in terms of
the essential mechanisms of momentum transfer to a hadron while remaining
intact. Different factorization schemes are considered and the conceptual
lacunas are pointed out. The quite technical subject of renormalization-group
evolution is given a detailed account. By combining analytical and numerical
algorithms, the one-gluon exchange nucleon evolution equation is diagonalized
and next-to-leading eigenfunctions are calculated in terms of Appell
polynomials. The corresponding anomalous dimensions of trilinear quark
operators are found to form a degenerate system whose envelope shows
logarithmic large-order behavior. Selected applications of this framework are
presented, focusing on the helicity-conserving elastic form factors of the pion
and the nucleon. The theoretical constraints imposed by QCD sum rules on the
moments of nucleon distribution amplitudes are used to determine a whole
spectrum of optional solutions. They organize themselves along an ``orbit''
characterized by a striking scaling relation between the form-factor ratio
$R=|G_{\rm M}^{\rm n}|/G_{\rm M}^{\rm p}$ and the projection coefficient
$B_{4}$ on to the corresponding eigensolution. The main reasons for the failure
of the present theoretical predictions to match the experimental data are
discussed and workable explanations are sketched.

constant, quantum fluctuations of fermions induce an effective Lagrangian
density whose imaginary (absorptive) part is purely nonperturbative and known
to be responsible for the fermion-antifermion pair creation. On the other hand,
the induced real (dispersive) part has perturbative and nonperturbative
contributions. In the one-loop case, we argue how to separate the two
contributions from each other for any strength of the field. We show
numerically that the nonperturbative contributions are in general comparable
with or larger than the induced perturbative ones. We arrive at qualitatively
similar conclusions also for the induced energy density. Further, we
investigate numerically the quasianalytic continuation of the perturbative
results into the nonperturbative sector, by employing (modified) Borel-Pade. It
turns out that in the case at hand, we have to integrate over renormalon
singularities, but there is no renormalon ambiguity involved.

equivalence, a new description of space-time $\SL$ in terms of

proposed. By using infinitesimal neighborhoos ($\MON$) of real number r on

Therefore, every point on $(\SM)^N$ automatically has the internal
confined-subspace $\MON$. A field theory on $\SL$ is proposed. It is shown that
U(1) and SU(N) symmetries on the space $(\SM)^N$ are induced from the internal
substructure $(\MON)^N$. Quantized state describing configuration space is
constructed on $(\SM)^N$. We see that Lorentz and general relativistic

(M-cai) for a given operator subspace X of an operator space Y. M-cai's
generalize central approximate identities in ideals in $C^*$-algebras, for it
is proved that if X admits an M-cai in Y, then X is a complete M-ideal in Y. It
is proved, using ``special'' M-cai's, that if $\cal J$ is a nuclear ideal in a
$C^*$-algebra $\cal A$, then $\cal J$ is completely complemented in Y for any
(isomorphically) locally reflexive operator space Y with $\cal J \subset Y
\subset \cal A$ and $Y/\cal J$ separable. (This generalizes the previously
known special case where $Y=\cal A$, due to Effros-Haagerup.) In turn, this
yields a new proof of the Oikhberg-Rosenthal Theorem that $\cal K$ is
completely complemented in any separable locally reflexive operator superspace,
$\cal K$ the $C^*$-algebra of compact operators on $\ell^2$. M-cai's are also
used in obtaining some special affirmative answers to the open problem of
whether $\cal K$ is Banach-complemented in $\cal A$ for any separable
$C^*$-algebra $\cal A$ with $\cal K\subset\cal A\subset B(\ell^2)$. It is shown
that if conversely X is a complete M-ideal in Y, then X admits an M-cai in Y in
the following situations: (i) Y has the (Banach) bounded approximation
property; (ii) Y is 1-locally reflexive and X is $\lambda$-nuclear for some
$\lambda \ge1$; (iii) X is a closed 2-sided ideal in an operator algebra Y (via
the Effros-Ruan result that then X has a contractive algebraic approximate
identity). However it is shown that there exists a separable Banach space X
which is an M-ideal in $Y=X^{**}$, yet X admits no M-approximate identity in Y.

measured at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies in the range 0--100 keV and at 2 MeV
by the TUNL and Wisconsin groups, respectively; contributions to the
Gerasimov-Drell-Hearn (GDH) integral in 3He from the two- up to the three-body
breakup thresholds, compared to experimental determinations by the TUNL group
in this threshold region; longitudinal, transverse, and interference response
functions measured in inclusive polarized electron scattering off polarized 3He
at excitation energies below the threshold for breakup into ppn, compared to
unpolarized longitudinal and transverse data from the Saskatoon group. The
calculations are based on a realistic Hamiltonian with two- and three-nucleon
interactions and a realistic current operator, including one- and two-body
components. The theoretical predictions obtained by including only one-body
currents are in violent disagreement with data. These differences between
theory and experiment are, to a large extent, removed when two-body currents
are taken into account, although some rather large discrepancies remain in the
c.m. energy range 0--100 keV, particularly for the pd differential cross
section and tensor analyzing power at small angles, and contributions to the
GDH integral. A rather detailed analysis indicates that these discrepancies
have, in large part, a common origin, and can be traced back to an excess
strength obtained in the theoretical calculation of the E1 reduced matrix
element associated with the pd channel having L,S,J=1,1/2,3/2. It is suggested
that this lack of E1 strength observed experimentally might have implications
for the nuclear interaction at very low energies. Finally, the validity of the
long-wavelength approximation for electric dipole transitions is discussed.

^{102}Sn to ^{130}Sn, exhibit a near constancy of the 2^+_1-0^+_1 excitation
energy, a constancy which can be related to strong pairing correlations and the
near degeneracy in energy of the relevant single particle orbits. Large
shell-model calculations for these isotopes reveal that the major contribution
to pairing correlations in the tin isotopes stems from the ^1S_0 partial wave
in the nucleon-nucleon interaction. Omitting this partial wave and the ^3P_2
wave in the construction of an effective interaction, results in a spectrum
which has essentially no correspondence with experiment. These partial wave are
also of importance for infinite neutron matter and nuclear matter and give the
largest contribution to the pairing interaction and energy gap in neutron star
matter.

a framework that accounts not only for the dynamical coupling of virtual
photons to correlated nucleon pairs but also for meson-exchange and
$\Delta_{33}$-isobar currents. Tensor correlations are observed to produce
substantially larger amounts of semi-exclusive ^{16}O(e,e'p) strength than
central correlations do and are predominantly manifest in the proton-neutron
knockout channel. With the exception of the $x \approx 2$ case, in all
kinematical situations studied the meson-exchange and isobar currents are a
strong source of A(e,e'p) strength at deep missing energies. This feature gives
the A(e,e'p) strength at deep missing energies a pronounced transverse
character.

spectra and two-pion correlation functions is discussed in terms of an
analytically solvable model. The applicability of its basic factorization
assumption is clarified. An approximate scaling of the basic observables with
the phase space density is demonstrated in the low density (gas) limit. This
scaling and also its violation at high densities due to the condensate
formation is described by approximate analytical formulae which allow, in
principle, for the identification of the multiboson effects among others. For
moderate densities indicated by the experimental data, a fast saturation of
multiboson effects with the number of contributing cumulants is obtained,
allowing for the account of these effects in realistic transport code
simulations. At high densities, the spectra are mainly determined by the
universal condensate term and the initially narrow Poisson multiplicity
distribution approaches a wide Bose-Einstein one. As a result, the intercepts
of the inclusive and fixed-$n$ correlation functions (properly normalized to 1
at large relative momenta) approach 2 and 1, respectively and their widths
logarithmically increase with the increasing phase space density. It is shown
that the neglect of energy-momentum constraints in the model is justified
except near a multipion threshold, where these constraints practically exclude
the possibility of a very cold condensate production. It is argued that
spectacular multiboson effects are likely to be observed only in the rare
events containing sufficiently high density (speckle) fluctuations.

alumina/water slurry dries. Both isotropic and directional drying were studied.
The dynamics of the pattern formation process and the geometric properties of
the isotropic crack patterns are similar to what is expected from recent
models, assuming weak disorder. There is some evidence for a gradual increase
in disorder as the drying layer become thinner, but no sudden transition, in
contrast to what has been seen in previous experiments. The morphology of the
crack patterns is influenced by drying gradients and front propagation effects,
with sharp gradients having a strong orienting and ordering effect.

forces. We also have found oscillatory convection at onset in an acetonitrile
