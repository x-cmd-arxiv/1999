2 introduces the Fourier decomposition, a tool to describe quantitatively the
light curves of pulsating stars. Sect. 3 shows how an observational result was
progressively built on the basis of old and new data; the latter were collected
on selected targets just to clarify some controversial points. Since different
pulsation modes were suspected among Cepheids, an independent confirmation was
searched for. To do that we applied the least-squares technique to Double Mode
Cepheids. By obtaining a very satisfactory description of their pulsational
content (Sect.4), we could confirm that between Cepheids with P<8d they are
both fundamental and first overtone pulsators (Sect.5). The detection of small
amplitude cross-coupling terms and higher harmonics in the light curves of
Double Mode Cepheids allowed us to quantify the properties of the high-order
terms and hence to discover other peculiarities (Sect.6), very useful to
complete the scenario of the resonance effects and to test some theoretical
models (Sect.7). Therefore, we can study the Cepheids from the point of view of
asteroseismology since to find resonance effects is as to sound their
interiors.

through evolving superbubbles within a smoothly varying HI distribution, we
estimate the fraction of ionizing photons emitted by OB associations that
escapes the HI disk of our Galaxy into the halo and intergalactic medium (IGM).
We consider both coeval star-formation and a Gaussian star-formation history
with a time spread sigma_t = 2 Myr. We consider both a uniform H I distribution
and a two-phase (cloud/intercloud) model, with a negligible filling factor of
hot gas. We find that the shells of the expanding superbubbles quickly trap or
attenuate the ionizing flux, so that most of the escaping radiation escapes
shortly after the formation of the superbubble. For the coeval star-formation
history, the total fraction of Lyman Continuum photons that escape both sides
of the disk in the solar vicinity is f_esc approx 0.15 +/- 0.05. For the
Gaussian star formation history, f_esc approx 0.06 +/- 0.03, a value roughly a
factor of two lower than the results of Dove & Shull (1994), where superbubbles
were not considered. For a local production rate of ionizing photons Psi_LyC =

  The molecular mass for the association of clouds in NGC 5461 is approximately
3x10^7 Mo and is accompanied by 1-2 times as much atomic mass. The observed CO

(UVB) is produced by the small (T_vir < 10^4 K) halos that collapse before

stars or black holes inside small halos, by photo-dissociating their only
cooling agent, molecular H2. We self-consistently compute the buildup of the
early UVB in Press-Schechter models, coupled with H2 photo-dissociation both in
the intergalactic medium (IGM), and inside virialized halos. We find that the
intergalactic H2 has a negligible effect on the UVB, both because its initial
optical depth is small (tau<0.1), and because it is photo-dissociated at an
early stage. If the UV sources in the first collapsed halos are stars, then
their UV flux suppresses further star-formation inside small halos. This
results in a pause in the buildup of the UVB, and reionization is delayed until
larger halos (T_vir> 10^4 K) collapse. If the small halos host mini-quasars
with hard spectra extending to approximately 1 keV, then their X-rays balance
the effects of the UVB, the negative feedback does not occur, and reionization

been identified, in good agreement with 8.7 events expected from Monte Carlo
calculations for atmospheric neutrinos. The second analysis is tailored to
muons coming from close to the opposite zenith. It yields 4 events, compared to
3.5 from Monte Carlo expectations. From this we derive a 90 % upper flux limit
of 1.1 * 10^-13 cm^-2 sec^-1 for muons in excess of those expected from
atmospheric neutrinos with zenith angle > 150 degrees and energy > 10GeV.

and semi-analytic modelling of galaxy formation to investigate the processes
that determine the spatial distribution of galaxies in cold dark matter (CDM)
models. The galaxy distribution depends sensitively on the efficiency with
which galaxies form in halos of different mass. In small mass halos, galaxy
formation is inhibited by the reheating of cooled gas by feedback processes,
whereas in large mass halos, it is inhibited by the long cooling time of the
gas. As a result, the mass-to-light ratio of halos has a deep minimum at the
halo mass associated with L* galaxies. This leads to a scale dependent bias in
the distribution of galaxies relative to the distribution of mass. On large
scales, the bias in the galaxy distribution is related in a simple way to the
bias in the distribution of massive halos. On small scales, the correlation
function is determined by the interplay between various effects including the
spatial exclusion of dark matter halos, the distribution function of the number
of galaxies occupying a single dark matter halo and, to a lesser extent,
dynamical friction. Remarkably, these processes conspire to produce a
correlation function in a flat, Omega_0=0.3, CDM model that is close to a
power-law over nearly four orders of magnitude in amplitude. This model agrees
well with the correlation function of galaxies measured in the APM survey. On
small scales, the model galaxies are less strongly clustered than the dark
matter whereas on large scales, they trace the occupied halos. Our clustering
predictions are robust to changes in the parameters of the galaxy formation
model, provided only those models that match the bright end of the galaxy
luminosity function are considered. (abridged)

  Abstract was abridged",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In spite of their overall success, semi-analytic models of galaxy formation
and evolution predict slopes of luminosity functions which are steeper than the
observed ones. This discrepancy has generally been explained by subtle surface
brightness effects acting on the observational samples. In this paper, we
explicitly implement the computation of surface brightness in a simple
semi-analytic model (with standard CDM), and we estimate the effect of
observational surface brightness thresholds on the predicted luminosity
functions. The crucial free parameter in this computation is the efficiency
epsilon of supernova feedback which is responsible for the triggering of
galactic winds. With the classical formalism for this process, it is difficult
to reproduce simultaneously the Tully-Fisher relation and the flat slope of the
observational luminosity function with the same value of epsilon. This suggests
that the triggering of galactic winds is a complex phenomenon. [...] The
conclusion of this heuristic paper is that a more realistic description of SN
feedback is needed, and that surface brightness effects should not be neglected
in the modelling of galaxy formation.

Andreev level and the continuous energy spectrum boundary for the same

infinite chain of kinetical equations which describe probability distributions

that quantum amplitudes for gravity formulated as functional integrals should
include a sum over not only physically distinct geometries and topologies but
also inequivalent differentiable structures. But can the inclusion of exotic
manifolds in such sums make a significant contribution to these quantum
amplitudes? This paper will demonstrate that it will. Simply connected exotic
Einstein manifolds with positive curvature exist in seven dimensions. Their
metrics are found numerically; they are shown to have volumes of the same order
of magnitude. Their contribution to the semiclassical evaluation of the
partition function for Euclidean quantum gravity in seven dimensions is
evaluated and found to be nontrivial. Consequently, inequivalent differentiable

evades the supersymmetric flavor problem since soft masses, like the anomaly,

decoupling of heavy threshold effects and how these conditions are evaded. We
use these results to build a realistic class of models where the non-decoupling
effects of ultra-heavy vectorlike matter fields eliminate the tachyons. These
models have a flavor invariant superspectrum similar to that of gauge mediated
models. They, however, differ in several aspects: the gaugino masses are not
unified, the colored sparticles are not much heavier than the others, the
mu-problem is less severe and the gravitino mass is well above the weak scale,

Their theory depends, among other things, on a theorem characterizing forms in
S_k(Gamma_0(N)) whose Fourier coefficients satisfy a certain vanishing
condition. Our proof involves rephrasing this vanishing condition in terms of
representation theory; this, together with an elementary linear algebra
argument, allows us to rewrite the problem as a collection of local problems.
Furthermore, the classical phrasing of the theorem makes the resulting local
problems trivial; this is in contrast to the method of Casselman, whose local
problem relies upon knowledge of the structure of irreducible representations
of GL_2(Q_p). Our proof is therefore much more accessible to mathematicians who
aren't specialists in the representation theory of p-adic groups; the method is
also applicable to other Atkin-Lehner-style problems.

nonlinear current feedback-loop between the electrons and holes injected from
the outer layers. By considering the device to be composed of an active
subsystem with negative differential resistance and a passive resistive layer
with positive differential resistance an analytical approach is suggested to
understand and describe the corresponding physical mechanisms in a
self-consistent way. Analytical solutions of the derived model equations allow
a description of homogeneous stationary states and yield explicit expressions
of the current-density vs. voltage characteristics of the whole structure and
its subsystems. A stability analysis of the homogeneous states with respect to
two-dimensional transversal harmonic fluctuations is performed for the two
cases under study. The resulting dispersion relations allow two different types
of instability. While the first one is of Ridley's type which is characteristic
for any spatially extended electrical system with negative differential
resistance, the second type can be considered as a solid-state analogue of
Turing's instability known as a generic instability mechanism which may lead,
e. g., to the formation of periodic patterns.

the purpose of equivalently developing gravitation.
  The behavior of gravitation is well known, as described by Newton's Law of
Gravitation. But just what gravitational mass is, how gravitational behavior
comes about, what in material reality produces the effects of gravitational
mass, has been little understood. The only extant hypotheses involve the
unsuccessful efforts to develop ""quantum gravitation"" and to tie it into the
rest of quantum mechanics, and the equally failed attempts to detect
""gravitons"" and ""gravitational waves"" in spite of very substantial efforts.
  From a starting point of only the limitation on the speed of light, the
necessity of conservation, and the impossibility of an infinity in material
reality, the present paper presents a new and comprehensive analysis of the
phenomenon gravitational mass:
  - how it appears in particles,
  - how the Newtonian gravitational behavior arises from that, and
  - how the values of inertial mass and gravitational mass are identical, or,
in other words, the mechanics of gravitational mass and gravitation.

derivative and with bounded support arise in a natural way in various
situations in physics, in particular in measurement theory. The propagation of
such initial wave functions is not well described by the Schr\""odinger current
which vanishes on the boundary of the support of the wave function. This
propagation gives rise to a uni-directional current at the boundary of the
support. We use path integrals to define current and uni-directional current
and give a direct derivation of the expression for current from the path
integral formulation for both diffusion and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we
give an explicit asymptotic expression for the short time propagation of
initial wave function with compact support for both the cases of discontinuous
derivative and discontinuous wave function. We show that in the former case the
probability propagated across the boundary of the support in time $\Delta t$ is
$O(\Delta t^{3/2})$ and the initial uni-directional current is $O(\Delta
t^{1/2})$. This recovers the Zeno effect for continuous detection of a particle
in a given domain. For the latter case the probability propagated across the
boundary of the support in time $\Delta t$ is $O(\Delta t^{1/2})$ and the
initial uni-directional current is $O(\Delta t^{-1/2})$. This is an anti-Zeno
effect. However, the probability propagated across a point located at a finite
distance from the boundary of the support is $O(\Delta t)$. This gives a decay
law.
