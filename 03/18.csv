within the tidal tail: it appears to be composed of two parallel filaments

discovery. The situation improved dramatically in 1997, when the rapid
availability of precise coordinates for the bursts allowed the detection of
faint optical and radio afterglows - optical spectra thus obtained have
demonstrated conclusively that the bursts occur at cosmological distances. But,
despite efforts by several groups, optical detection has not hitherto been
achieved during the brief duration of a burst. Here we report the detection of
bright optical emission from GRB990123 while the burst was still in progress.
Our observations begin 22 seconds after the onset of the burst and show an
increase in brightness by a factor of 14 during the first 25 seconds; the
brightness then declines by a factor of 100, at which point (700 seconds after
the burst onset) it falls below our detection threshold. The redshift of this
burst, approximately 1.6, implies a peak optical luminosity of 5 times 10^{49}
erg per second. Optical emission from gamma-ray bursts has been generally
thought to take place at the shock fronts generated by interaction of the
primary energy source with the surrounding medium, where the gamma-rays might
also be produced. The lack of a significant change in the gamma-ray light curve
when the optical emission develops suggests that the gamma-rays are not
produced at the shock front, but closer to the site of the original explosion.

the full range of astrophysically plausible mass distributions, using as
constraints the numerous multiply-imaged sources which have been detected. We
obtain the first adequate fit to all the observations, but only if we include
effects from the galaxy cluster beyond a constant local magnification and
shear. Both the lens galaxy and the surrounding cluster must depart from
circular symmetry as well.
  Lens models which are consistent with observations to 95% CL indicate
H0=104^{+31}_{-23}(1-\kthirty) km/s/Mpc. Previous weak lensing measurements
constrain the mean mass density within 30"" of G1 to be kthirty=0.26+/-0.16 (95%

the range 65--80 km/s/Mpc. Further observations will shrink the confidence
interval for both the mass model and \kthirty.
  The range of H0 allowed by the full gamut of our lens models is substantially
larger than that implied by limiting consideration to simple power law density
profiles. We therefore caution against use of simple isothermal or power-law

also means that the luminosity of GMCs in ULIRGs must be very high, as they

  The variation of the N/O ratio as a function of metallicity in SBNGs follows
a primary + secondary relation, but the increase of nitrogen does not appear as
a continuous process. In SBNGs, nitrogen is probably produced by different
populations of intermediate-mass stars, which were formed during past sequences
of bursts of star formation. This assumption pushes the origin of the main
bursts 2-3 Gyrs back in the past. On a cosmological scale, this time interval
corresponds to redshifts z = 0.2-0.3, where a significant increase of star
formation activity occurred. The origin of the SBNG phenomenon would thus have
cosmological implications, it would be related to a more active phase of star
formation in the Universe sometime in its recent past.

ionizing flux from this cluster by about an order of magnitude with respect to
earlier estimates, to 10^{50.9} photons/s, or roughly what is required to
ionize the nearby ``Sickle'' HII region (G0.18 - 0.04). The total luminosity
from the massive cluster stars is $\approx 10^{7.5}$ \Lsun, enough to account
for the heating of the nearby molecular cloud, M0.20 - 0.033. We propose a
picture which integrates most of the major features in this part of the sky,
excepting the non-thermal filaments. We compare the cluster to other young
massive clusters and globular clusters, finding that it is unique in stellar
content and age, except, perhaps, for the young cluster in the central parsec
of the Galaxy. In addition, we find that the cluster is comparable to small
``super star clusters.''

accretion phase (`Class 0' objects), and has made it possible to probe, for the
first time, the inner density structure of pre-collapse cores. Class 0 objects
are characterized by strong, centrally-condensed dust continuum emission at
submillimeter wavelengths, very little emission shortward of 10 microns, and
powerful jet-like outflows. Direct evidence for gravitational infall has been
observed toward several of them. They are interpreted as accreting protostars
which have not yet accumulated the majority of their final stellar mass. In
contrast to protostars, pre-stellar cores have flat inner density profiles,
suggesting the initial conditions for fast protostellar collapse depart
sometimes significantly from a singular isothermal sphere. In the case of
non-singular initial conditions, the beginning of protostellar evolution is
expected to feature a brief phase of vigorous accretion/ejection which may
coincide with Class 0 objects. In addition, submillimeter continuum imaging
surveys of regions of multiple star formation such as Ophiuchus and Serpens
suggest a picture according to which each star in an embedded cluster is built
from a finite reservoir of mass and the associated IMF is primarily determined
at the pre-stellar stage of evolution.

microlensing experiments towards M31 can only observe the high-magnification

microlensing signals by planets is in distortions near the peak of
high-magnification events as discussed by Griest and Safizadeh. We calculate
the probability to detect planetary anomalies for microlensing experiments

the free end of an isolated broken plane wave (wave tip) can either rotate
(steadily or unsteadily) around a large excitable core, thereby producing a
spiral pattern, or retract causing the wave to vanish at boundaries. An
asymptotic analysis of spiral motion and retraction is carried out in this
weakly excitable large core regime starting from the free-boundary limit of the
reaction-diffusion models, valid when the excited region is delimited by a thin
interface. The wave description is shown to naturally split between the tip
region and a far region that are smoothly matched on an intermediate scale.
This separation allows us to rigorously derive an equation of motion for the
wave tip, with the large scale motion of the spiral wavefront slaved to the
tip. This kinematic description provides both a physical picture and exact
predictions for a wide range of wave behavior, including: (i) steady rotation
(frequency and core radius), (ii) exact treatment of the meandering instability
in the free-boundary limit with the prediction that the frequency of unstable
motion is half the primary steady frequency (iii) drift under external actions
(external field with application to axisymmetric scroll ring motion in
three-dimensions, and spatial or/and time-dependent variation of excitability),
and (iv) the dynamics of multi-armed spiral waves with the new prediction that
steadily rotating waves with two or more arms are linearly unstable. Numerical
simulations of FitzHug-Nagumo kinetics are used to test several aspects of our
results. In addition, we discuss the semi-quantitative extension of this theory
to finite cores and pinpoint mathematical subtleties related to the thin
interface limit of singly diffusive reaction-diffusion models.

junctions. The relative particle flux into different possible directions
exiting from a single pore, for two and three dimensional model porous media is
found to approximately equal the corresponding fractional channel width or
area. Next we consider the waiting time distribution for particles which are
delayed in a junction, due to a stagnation point caused by a flow bifurcation.
The waiting times are found to be controlled by two-particle interactions, and
the distributions take the same form in model porous media as in two-particle
systems. A simple theoretical estimate of the waiting time is consistent with
the simulations. We also find that perturbing such a slow-moving particle by
another nearby one leads to rather complicated behavior. We study the stability
of geometrically trapped particles. For simple model traps, we find that
particles passing nearby can ``relaunch'' the trapped particle through its
hydrodynamic interaction, although the conditions for relaunching depend

is discussed. The hydrodynamic mode structure for the dynamics of the system is
compared with that of bulk systems. We show that to describe the dynamic
correlation functions for the system, in general, it is necessary to consider
the smectic layer displacement $u$ and the velocity normal to the layers,
$v_z$, together. Finally, our analysis also provides a basis for the
theoretical study of the off-equilibrium dynamics of freely-standing smectic-A
films.

resonance has to be nearly critically damped as a result of the anomalous

modeled as a perfect fluid, possesses a bound on its mass m by its radial size
R given by 2m/R \le 8/9 and that this bound continues to hold when the energy
density decreases monotonically. The existence of such a bound is intriguing
because it occurs well before the appearance of an apparent horizon at m = R/2.
However, the assumptions made are extremely restrictive. They do not hold in a
humble soap bubble and they certainly do not approximate any known
topologically stable field configuration. We show that the 8/9 bound is robust
by relaxing these assumptions. If the density is monotonically decreasing and
the tangential stress is less than or equal to the radial stress we show that
the 8/9 bound continues to hold through the entire bulk if m is replaced by the
quasi-local mass. If the tangential stress exceeds the radial stress and/or the
density is not monotonic we cannot recover the 8/9 bound. However, we can show
that 2m/R remains strictly bounded away from unity by constructing an explicit
upper bound which depends only on the ratio of the stresses and the variation
of the density.

fifth degree polynomial. At the method's core is a rational mapping of the
Riemann sphere with the icosahedral symmetry of a general quintic. Moreover,
this map posseses ""reliable"" dynamics: for almost any initial point, the its
trajectory converges to one of the periodic cycles that comprise an icosahedral
orbit. This symmetry-breaking provides for a reliable or ""generally-convergent""
quintic-solving algorithm: with almost any fifth-degree equation, associate a
rational mapping that has reliable dynamics and whose attractor consists of
points from which one computes a root.
  An algorithm that solves the sixth-degree equation requires a dynamical
system with the symmetry of the alternating group on six things. This group
does not act on the Riemmann sphere, but does act on the complex projective
plane--this is the Valentiner group. The present work exploits the resulting
2-dimensional geometry in finding a Valentiner-symmetric rational mapping whose
elegant dynamics experimentally appear to be reliable in the above
sense---transferred to the 2-dimensional setting. This map provides the central
feature of a conjecturally-reliable sextic-solving algorithm analogous to that

interpret the capacity of noisy quantum channels. The two-Pauli channel is used
to illustrate the idea. The fidelity of the channel is also considered. Noise
enhancement is found for the fidelity but not for the capacity.

and pressure between an unusual pair of parallel plates at finite temperature,
namely: a perfectly conducting plate and an infinitely permeable one. The high
and low temperature limits of these quantities are discussed; relationships
between high and low temperature limits are estabkished by means of a modified
version of the temperature inversion symmetry.

lowest electronic states of doped quantum dots (QDs). Many QDs are located in a
microcavity. A pair of gates controls the energy levels in each QD. A
Controlled Not (CNOT) operation involving any pair of QDs can be effected by a
sequence of gate-voltage pulses which tune the QD energy levels into resonance
with frequencies of the cavity or a laser. The duration of a CNOT operation is
estimated to be much shorter than the time for an electron to decohere by
emitting an acoustic phonon.
