September 1998 of the stars within the position error circle of the recently
discovered 12min pulsating X-ray source 1WGA J1958.2+3232. Based on photometry
and slitless spectroscopy, we selected a likely optical counterpart, which was
subsequently determined to be a m_V=15.7 B0Ve star, the spectral properties of
which are in good agreement with the X-ray results. The proposed optical
counterpart shows several H, He and Fe emission-lines, while the interstellar
absorption spectral features place the star at a distance of about 800 pc.The
inferred X-ray luminosity for this distance is about 10^33 erg s^-1 in the
2--10 keV band. We conclude that 1WGA J1958.2+3232 is a likely new long-period
low-luminosity accreting neutron star in a Be-star/X-ray binary system.

density gradient (of 3%, 20% or 100% over one accretion radius) perpendicular
to the relative motion. Similarly to the 3D models published previously, both
with velocity gradients and without, the models with a density gradient
presented here exhibit non-stationary flow patterns, although the Mach cone
remains fairly stable. The accretion rates of mass, linear and angular momenta
do not fluctuate as strongly as published previously for 2D models. No obvious
trend of the dependency of mass accretion rate fluctuations on the density
gradient can be discerned. The average specific angular momentum accreted is
roughly between zero and 70% of the total angular momentum available in the
accretion cylinder in the cases where the average is prograde. Due to the large
fluctuations during accretion, the average angular momentum of some models is
retrograde by up to 25%. Small gradients hardly influence the average accretion
rates as compared to accretion from a homogeneous medium, while very large ones
succeed to dominate and form an accretion flow in which the sense of rotation
is not inverted.

evolution of the source during the outburst can be considered a sequence of
qualitatively distinct states. During the first observations, corresponding to
the maximum of X-ray flux, the spectrum of the source consisted of a dominating
hard power law component and a soft thermal component, which can be described
by the model of multicolor disk emission. The hard component contributed >80%
to the X-ray luminosity in the 3-25 keV energy band. Overall two-component
spectral shape is an attribute of Very High state (VHS) observed previously in
BHC, but the domination of hard component is unusual. Later on, as the X-ray
source faded, its energy spectrum qualitatively changed, showing High (HS) and
then Low (LS) states, both typical for black hole binaries. As the energy
spectrum changed, the fast variability also evolved dramatically. Initially the
power density spectrum was formed by a dominating band-limited noise component,
QPO features at 20-30 Hz and at ~0.5 Hz, and a very low frequency noise
component. After a significant decrease of the contribution of the hard
spectral component the amplitude of the fractional variability decreased by an
order of magnitude and the PDS spectrum adopted a power-law shape with a broad
QPO peak around 0.03 Hz. When the system switched to the LS, the PDS shape
changed again and the QPOs have not been detected since. When the source was
observed in VHS, a clear correlation between QPO parameters and X-ray flux was
seen.

from the mean intracluster gas fraction of X-ray clusters may be biased by a
single-phase assumption for the thermodynamic structure of the intracluster

a spherically symmetric ICM contains isobaric density perturbations with
radially dependent variance \sigma^2(r)=\sigma_c^2 (1+r^2/r_c^2)^{-\eps}. The
model extends the work of Gunn & Thomas (1996) which assumed radially
independent density fluctuations thoughout the ICM. Fixing the X-ray emission
profile and emission weighted temperature, we explore two independently
observable signatures of the model in the {\sigma_c,\eps} space. For
bremsstrahlung dominated emission, the central Sunyaev--Zeldovich (SZ)
decrement in the multiphase case is increased over the single-phase case and
multiphase X-ray spectra in the range 0.1-20 keV are flatter in the continuum
and exhibit stronger low energy emission lines than their single-phase
counterpart. We quantify these effects for a fiducial 10^8 K cluster and
demonstrate how the combination of SZ and X-ray spectroscopy can be used to
identify a preferred location in the {\sigma_c,\eps} plane. From these
parameters, the correct value of mean ICM gas fraction in the multiphase model
results, allowing an unbiased estimate of \Omega_m to be recovered. The
consistency of recent determinations of the Hubble constant from SZ and X-ray
observations with values determined by other methods suggests that biases in
ICM gas fractions are small, \ltsim 20%.

critical value, M_{crit}, above which rapid gas accretion begins. We model the
structure of the protoplanetary nebula as an accretion disk with constant
\alpha. We present analytic fits for the steady state relation between disk
surface density and mass accretion rate as a function of radius r. We calculate
M_{crit} as a function of r, gas accretion rate through the disk, and
planetesimal accretion rate onto the core \dot{M}. For a fixed \dot{M},
M_{crit} increases inwards, and it decreases with \dot{M}. We find that \dot{M}
onto cores migrating inwards in a time 10^3-10^5 yr at 1 AU is sufficient to
prevent the attainment of M_{crit} during the migration process. Only at small
radii where planetesimals no longer exist can M_{crit} be attained. At small
radii, the runaway gas accretion phase may become longer than the disk lifetime
if the core mass is too small. However, massive cores can be built-up through
the merger of additional incoming cores on a timescale shorter than for in situ
formation. Therefore, feeding zone depletion in the neighborhood of a fixed
orbit may be avoided. Accordingly, we suggest that giant planets may begin to
form early in the life of the protostellar disk at small radii, on a timescale
that may be significantly shorter than for in situ formation. (abridged)

pulses of particles one can increase the growth rate and assist layer-by-layer

be used to control size and shape of the three-dimensional structures. By
controlled reduction of the flux with time we achieve a fast coarsening

$I_{pr}<I_c$ ($I_c$ is the critical current of the JJ) and frequency $f_{pr}$,

""pump signal"". Varying the frequency ratio $f_{pm}/f_{pr}$ from 0.5 to 100, and
the current amplitude of the probe signal from 0.01 to 0.9 of $I_c$, we found
that the dependence of the junction impedance at the frequency $f_{pr}$,
$Z_s^{f_{pr}}$, versus $I_{pm}$ preserves its general features, independent of
$f_{pm}/f_{pr}$ and $I_{pr}/I_c$ values. At the same time, some particular

one and the same signal plays the roles of the pump and the probe signals

wall. Couplings between them are then suppressed due to the exponentially small
overlaps of their wave functions. This provides a framework for understanding
both the fermion mass hierarchy and proton stability without imposing
symmetries, but rather in terms of higher dimensional geography. A model
independent prediction of this scenario is non-universal couplings of the
Standard Model fermions to the ``Kaluza-Klein'' excitations of the gauge
fields. This allows a measurement of the fermion locations in the extra
dimensions at the LHC or NLC if the wall thickness is close to the TeV scale.

the zero curvature representation for two-dimensional integrable models to

The method has been used to study several theories of physical interest, like
self-dual Yang-Mills theories, Bogomolny equations, non-linear sigma models and
Skyrme-type models. The local version of the generalized zero curvature
involves a Lie algebra and a representation of it, leading to a number of
conservation laws equal to the dimension of that representation. We discuss the
conditions a given theory has to satisfy in order for its associated zero
curvature to admit an infinite dimensional (reducible) representation. We also
present the theory in the more abstract setting of the space of loops, which
gives a deeper understanding and a more simple formulation of integrability in

relevant once we allow for a more general class of target metrics, as well as

known how to phrase the first four problems as the estimation of eigenvalues of
certain unitary operators. Here we show how the solution to the more general
Abelian `hidden subgroup problem' can also be described and analysed as such.
We then point out how certain instances of these problems can be solved with
only one control qubit, or `flying qubits', instead of entire registers of
control qubits.
