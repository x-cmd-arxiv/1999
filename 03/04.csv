  The Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/307675",,"astro-ph",,"  We develop diagnostics to detect the presence and orientation of a bar in an
edge-on disk, using its kinematical signature in the position-velocity diagram
(PVD) of a spiral galaxy observed edge-on. Using a well-studied barred spiral
galaxy mass model, we briefly review the orbital properties of two-dimensional
non-axisymmetric disks and identify the main families of periodic orbits. We
use those families as building blocks to model real galaxies and calculate the
PVDs obtained for various realistic combinations of periodic orbit families and
for a number of viewing angles with respect to the bar. We show that the global
structure of the PVD is a reliable bar diagnostic in edge-on disks.
Specifically, the presence of a gap between the signatures of the families of
periodic orbits in the PVD follows directly from the non-homogeneous
distribution of the orbits in a barred galaxy. Similarly, material in the two
so-called forbidden quadrants of the PVD results from the elongated shape of
the orbits. We show how the shape of the signatures of the dominant x1 and x2
families of periodic orbits in the PVD can be used efficiently to determine the
viewing angle with respect to the bar and, to a lesser extent, to constrain the
mass distribution of an observed galaxy. We also address the limitations of the
models when interpreting observational data.

constructing pixel-by-pixel optical depth distributions, a technique recently
developed by Cowie & Songaila (1998). By simulating stacks of synthetic

hampered by random redshift offsets between CIV lines and their corresponding

other turbulent inputs. The structures which form reproduce well observed
velocity-size scaling properties, while predicting the non-existence of a
general density-size scaling law. Criteria for the formation of
gravitationally-bound structures by turbulent compression are summarized. For
flows with equations of state $P\propto \rho^\gamma$, the statistics of the
density field depend on the exponent $\gamma$. Numerical simulations of both
forced and decaying MHD compressible turbulence have shown that the decay rate
is comparable to the non-magnetic case. For virialized clouds, the turbulent
decay time is shorter than the gravitational free-fall time, so wholesale cloud
collapse is only prevented by ongoing turbulent inputs and/or a strong mean
magnetic field. Finally, perspectives for future work in this field are briefly
discussed.

order 2.5e+05 particles of mass $m_p \simeq 10^{10} \Msun$, have triaxial mass
distributions, and significant substructure exists within their virial radii.
Not surprisingly, the level of agreement between the mass profiles obtained
from the various estimators and the actual mass profiles is found to be
scale-dependent.
  The virial estimator yields a good measurement of the total cluster mass,
though it is systematically underestimated by of order 10%. This result
suggests that, at least in the limit of ideal data, the virial estimator is
quite robust to deviations from pure spherical symmetry and the presence of
substructure. The dynamical mass estimate based upon a measurement of the
cluster velocity dispersion and an assumption of an isothermal potential yields
a poor measurement of the total mass. The weak lensing estimate yields a very
good measurement of the total mass, provided the mean shear used to determine
the equivalent cluster velocity dispersion is computed from an average of the
lensing signal over the entire cluster (i.e. the mean shear is computed
interior to the virial radius). [abridged]

evolution and structure of a massive accretion disk may be influenced by the
deposition of mass and angular momentum by an infalling Bondi-Hoyle wind. Such
a mass influx impacts the long-term behavior of the disk by providing
additional sources of viscosity and heating. Here, we make improvements over
this earlier work by incorporating the results of 3D hydrodynamical simulations
of the large scale accretion from an ambient medium into the disk evolution
equations developed previously. We discuss two models, one with the axis of the
disk parallel to, and the second with the axis oriented perpendicular to the
large scale Bondi-Hoyle flow. We find that the mass inflow rate onto the disk
within logarithmic annuli is roughly constant with radius and that the
impacting wind carries much less specific angular momentum than Keplerian. We
also find, in general, that the infrared spectrum of a wind-fed disk system is
steeper than that of a Shakura-Sunyaev configuration, due mainly to the
dissipation of the wind's kinetic energy at the disk's surface. In applying our
results to the Galactic Center black hole candidate, Sgr A*, we demonstrate
that a high wind inflow rate of order 10^-4 solar masses per year cannot be
incorporated into a fossil disk without a significant dissipation of kinetic
energy at all radii. Such a high dissipation would violate current infrared and
near-infrared limits on the observed spectrum of Sgr A*.

supernovae can make the cold interstellar clouds evaporate. We find that the
maximum size of evaporating cloud is 10 pc. Thus, clouds larger than 10 pc can
survive during the initial star formation. These surviving clouds can
contribute to the second star formation to produce ``intermediate-age ($\sim$
3--10 Gyr ago) stellar populations.'' Assuming that collisions between clouds
induce star formation and that the timescale of the second star formation is a
few Gyr, we estimate the total mass of the clouds. The total mass is about
$10^{4}M_\odot$, which is 1--3 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical
stellar mass of a present dSph. This implies that the initial star formation is
dominant over the second star formation, which is broadly consistent with the
observed star formation histories. However, the variety of the dSphs in their

electromagnetic self-energy of the charge distribution, (ii) the net
electromagnetic energy radiated to infinity (and/or into a black hole/white

proven for linearized gravitational fields off of a stationary, asymptotically
flat background, with the second order Einstein tensor playing the role of an
effective stress-energy tensor of the linearized field. In this paper, we prove
the above theorems for smooth sources and then investigate the extent to which
they continue to hold for point particle sources. The ``self-energy'' of point
particles is ill defined, but in the electromagnetic case, we can consider
situations where, initially and finally, the point charges are stationary and
in the same spatial position, so that the self-energy terms should cancel.
Under certain assumptions concerning the decay behavior of source-free
solutions to Maxwell's equations, we prove the vanishing of the sum of the net
energy radiated to infinity and the net work done on the particle by the
DeWitt-Brehme radiation reaction force. We also obtain a similar conservation
theorem for angular momentum in an axisymmetric spacetime. In the gravitational
case, we argue that similar conservation results should hold for freely falling
point masses whose orbits begin and end at infinity.

undergone a revolution. Deficits of the atmospheric muon neutrino flux and the
solar electron neutrino flux compared to their predicted values can be
understood in terms of neutrino oscillations and we can therefore infer that
neutrinos have non-degenerate masses. Additional but somewhat less secure
evidence for \bar\nu_\mu \to \bar\nu_e and \nu_\mu\to\nu_e oscillations has
been found in the LSND accelerator experiment. Because these experiments have
widely different L/E_\nu ranges (\approx 10 to 10^4 km/GeV for atmospheric,
\approx 10^{11} for solar, and \approx 1 for LSND), the mass-squared
differences required to explain the phenomena must be distinct. Given the
observations, an important next step is to deduce the pattern of neutrino
masses and mixings. Such studies depend on the number of neutrinos. The
invisible width of the Z-boson measured in LEP experiments gives N_\nu =
2.993\pm 0.011, consistent with the usual \nu_e, \nu_\mu and \nu_\tau ""active""
neutrinos. But there may also be right-handed ""sterile"" neutrinos with no weak
interactions. Only the observation of oscillations of the active neutrinos to
sterile neutrinos can test for their existence. In the following, we first
discuss the atmospheric and solar neutrino data in a 3-neutrino framework and
then later generalize our considerations to include the LSND data with
oscillations of four neutrinos.

($\sigma_{\mu\nu}$). An helicity projection method is used to evaluate exactly
the tree-level amplitudes of the contributing parton subprocesses ($2\to 4$),

interferences. Numerical estimates of the corresponding signal cross-section
that implement kinematical cuts needed to suppress the Standard Model

non-observation of the LSD signal it is found that LHC would exclude a

grid on the one hand, and perfect matchings (also known as dimer coverings) of
the square grid on the other, is extended to the setting of general planar
directed (and undirected) graphs, where edges carry nonnegative weights that
induce a weighting on the set of spanning trees. We show that the weighted,
directed spanning trees (often called arborescences) of any planar graph G can
be put into a one-to-one weight-preserving correspondence with the perfect
matchings of a related planar graph H.
  One special case of this result is a bijection between perfect matchings of
the hexagonal honeycomb lattice and directed spanning trees of a triangular
lattice. Another special case gives a correspondence between perfect matchings
of the ``square-octagon'' lattice and directed weighted spanning trees on a
directed weighted version of the cartesian lattice.
  In conjunction with results of Kenyon, our main theorem allows us to compute
the measures of all cylinder events for random spanning trees on any (directed,
weighted) planar graph. Conversely, in cases where the perfect matching model
arises from a tree model, Wilson's algorithm allows us to quickly generate
random samples of perfect matchings.

accept non-regular languages with bounded error in polynomial time. If we
restrict the head of the automaton to moving classically and to moving only in

reduced to a proper subset of the regular languages.
  In this paper we study two different models of 1-way quantum finite automata.
The first model, termed measure-once quantum finite automata, was introduced by
Moore and Crutchfield, and the second model, termed measure-many quantum finite
automata, was introduced by Kondacs and Watrous.
  We characterize the measure-once model when it is restricted to accepting
with bounded error and show that, without that restriction, it can solve the
word problem over the free group. We also show that it can be simulated by a
probabilistic finite automaton and describe an algorithm that determines if two
measure-once automata are equivalent.
  We prove several closure properties of the classes of languages accepted by
measure-many automata, including inverse homomorphisms, and provide a new
necessary condition for a language to be accepted by the measure-many model
with bounded error. Finally, we show that piecewise testable languages can be
accepted with bounded error by a measure-many quantum finite automaton, in the
process introducing new construction techniques for quantum automata.
