large fraction of the hard X-ray emission of M82 (depending on the flux state)

involved in the formation of bulges. Here we present a simple empirical model
in which bulge material is assembled via gravitational accretion of the visible
companion galaxies. Assuming that merging leads to a starburst, we show that
the resulting winds can be strong enough that they self-regulate the accretion.
A quasi-equilibrium accretion process naturally leads to the Kormendy relation
between bulge density and size. Whether or not the winds are sufficiently
strong and long lived to create the quasi-equilibrium must be tested with
observations. To illustrate the model we use it to predict representative
parameter dependent star formation histories. We find that bulge building
activity peaks around redshift two, with tails to both higher and lower

astrophysical objects, but its modelization is still far from satisfactory. We
discuss here what can be learned from laboratory experiments. We analyze the
results obtained by Wendt (1933) and Taylor (1936) on the classical
Couette-Taylor flow, in the case where angular momentum increases with distance
from the rotation axis, which is the most interesting for astrophysical
applications. We show that when the gap between the coaxial cylinders is wide
enough, the criterion for the onset of the finite amplitude instability can be
expressed in terms of a gradient Reynolds number. Based on Wendt's results, we
argue that turbulence may be sustained by differential rotation when the
angular velocity decreases outward, as in keplerian flows. From the rotation
profiles and the torque measurements we deduce a prescription for the turbulent
viscosity which is independent of gap width; with some caution it may be
applied to stellar interiors and to accretion disks.

column of gas. The X-ray flux changes by a factor of 2 from period to period,

times larger than the other elements in a unit of the solar ratio. The

beamed Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) sources. Prompt x-rays are inevitable due to the
less highly blueshifted photons emitted at angles greater than 1/gamma relative
to the beam symmetry axis, where gamma is the expansion Lorentz factor. The
observed flux depends on the combinations (gamma Delta theta) and (gamma
theta_v), where (Delta theta) is the beaming angle and theta_v is the viewing

the minimum detection rate of prompt x-ray bursts as a function of limiting
sensitivity. We compare our predictions with the results from the Ariel V

great enough to place significant constraints on gamma and (Delta theta). We
estimate that a detector with fluence limit ~10^{-7} erg/cm^2 in the 2-10 keV

properties of the dark matter halos appearing in cosmic density fields once
they underwent a strongly nonlinear evolution induced by gravitational
dynamics. Assuming that the high-order correlation functions of the matter

correlation properties of the halos, that are assumed to represent the
correlation properties of galaxies or clusters.
  The hierarchical pattern originally induced by gravity is shown to be
conserved for the halos. The strength of their correlations at any order
varies, however, but is found to depend only on their internal properties,
namely on the parameter x=m/r^(3-gamma) where m is the mass of the halo, r its
size and gammma is the power law index of the two-body correlation function. We
were able to derive the explicit form of the generating function of the moments
of the halo count probability distribution function. In particular we show
explicitely that, generically, S_p(x) -> p^(p-2) in the rare halo limit.
  Various illustrations of our general results are presented. As a function of
the properties of the underlying matter field, we construct the count
probabilities for halos and in particular discuss the halo void probability. We
also evaluate the dependence of the halo mass function on the environment. We
found that within clusters, hierarchical clustering implies the higher masses
are favored. We stress that this bias is naturally induced by gravity.

different peculiar velocity models. Therefore, the derivation of the luminosity
function is carried out using the locations of field and grouped galaxies in
real distance space.
  The local field galaxy luminosity function in the B system is well described
by a Schechter function. The exact values of the Schechter parameters slightly
depend on the adopted peculiar velocity field models.
  The shape of the luminosity function of spiral galaxies does not differ
significantly from that of E-S0 galaxies. On the other hand, the late-type
spirals and irregulars have a very steeply rising luminosity function towards
the faint end, whereas the ellipticals appreciably decrease in number towards
low luminosities.
  The presence of galaxy systems in the NOG sample does not affect
significantly the field galaxy luminosity function, since environmental effects
on the total luminosity function appear to be marginal.

mixture of lipid molecules is investigated. In the proposed model, the
inclusion-induced deformation of the film, and the resulting energy cost are
strongly dependent upon the spontaneous curvature of the mixed film. The
spontaneous curvature is in turn strongly influenced by the composition of
film. This coupling between the film composition and the energy per inclusion
leads to a lateral modulation of the composition, which follows the local
curvature of the membrane. In particular, it is shown that the inclusion may
induce a global phase separation in a film which would otherwise be
homogeneously mixed. The mixed film is then composed of patches of different
average composition, separated by the inclusions. This process may be of
relevance to explain some aspects of lipid-protein association in biological

log-normal form in the center. However, the asymptotic behavior is better
described by a power-law distribution characterized by an exponent 1 + \mu
\approx 4. For individual companies, we find a power law asymptotic behavior of
the probability distribution of volatility with exponent 1 + \mu \approx 4,
similar to the S&P 500 index. In addition, we find that the volatility
distribution scales for a range of time intervals. Further, we study the
correlation function of the volatility and find power law decay with long
persistence for the S&P 500 index and the individual companies with a crossover
at approximately 1.5 days. To quantify the power-law correlations, we apply
power spectrum analysis and a recently-developed modified root-mean-square
analysis, termed detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). For the S&P 500 index,
DFA estimates for the exponents characterizing the power law correlations are
\alpha_1=0.66 for short time scales (within \approx 1.5 days) and \alpha_2=0.93
for longer time scales (up to a year). For individual companies, we find
\alpha_1=0.60 and \alpha_2=0.74, respectively. The power spectrum gives

the limit value of the free energy at long times is equal to the equilibrium

principle measurable in an aging experiment. For a class of systems possessing
stochastic stability, we show that this new order parameter function is
intimately related to the static order parameter function, describing the
distribution of overlaps between clustering states. The same method is applied
to investigate the geometrical organization of pure states. We show that the
ultrametric organization in the dynamics implies static ultrametricity, and we
relate these properties to static separability, i.e., the property that the
measure of the overlap between pure states is essentially unique. Our results,
especially relevant for spin glasses, pave the way to an experimental

examine how the production of pairs of scalars at $e^+e^-$, $\gamma \gamma$ and
hadron colliders can be used to further probe the effects of graviton tower
exchange. In particular we examine the tree-level production of pairs of
identical Higgs fields which occurs only at the loop level in both the Standard

sections for such processes are found to be potentially large at the LHC and
the next generation of linear colliders. For the $\gamma\gamma$ case the role
of polarization in improving sensitivity to graviton exchange is emphasized.

this state is not likely to be accessible to any systematic approximation. We
note that the racetrack scheme, often cited as a counterexample, suffers from
similar difficulties. We stress that the weakness of the gauge couplings, the

extract some information in a systematic approximation. We review the ideas of
Kahler stabilization, an attempt to reconcile these facts. We consider whether
the system is likely to sit at extremes of the moduli space, as in recent

The exponent eta describes the low frequency behaviour of the Fourier transform
of the critical two-point connectivity function, while delta describes the
behaviour of the magnetization at the critical point. Our main result is an
asymptotic relation showing that, in a joint sense, eta = 0 and delta = 2. The
proof uses a major extension of our earlier expansion method for percolation.
This result provides evidence that the scaling limit of the incipient infinite

super-Brownian excursion (ISE), in dimensions above 6. In the sequel to this
paper, we extend our methods to prove that the scaling limits of the incipient

is finite dimensional, it's dimension grows with $n$. So we can ask how to
obtain a way to describe particular metrics of $Met(E_{n})$ using $Met(W_{n})$.
First, we link these two spaces by two morphisms $L_{n}$ and $I_{n}$. Donaldson
gave a criterion for detecting Einstein Hermitian metrics on $Met(E_{n})$,
using a functional $\mathcal M$. We construct another functional on

$\mathcal M-\mathcal KN\circ L_{n}$ becomes small when $n$ grows.
