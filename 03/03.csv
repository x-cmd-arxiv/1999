spectrograph on the UK Schmidt Telescope.
  The galaxies we measured were uniformly distributed over the survey area in
contrast to previous samples which were concentrated in several rich Abell
clusters. Most of the galaxies (230) were members of the Shapley supercluster:
they trace out two previously unknown sheets of galaxies linking the Abell
clusters of the supercluster. In a 44 square deg area of the supercluster
excluding the Abell clusters, these sheets alone represent an overdensity of a
factor of 2.0+/-0.2 compared to a uniform galaxy distribution.
  The supercluster is not flattened in the Declination direction as was
suggested in previous papers. Within our survey area the new galaxies
contribute an additional 50% to the known contents of the Shapley supercluster
with a corresponding increase in its contribution to the motion of the local

exhibit severe changes that are inconsistent with the moding phenomenon as
known from slowly rotating pulsars. We study these profile instabilities in
particular for PSR J1022+1001 and show that they occur smoothly, exhibiting
longer time constants than those associated with moding. In addition, the
profile changes of this pulsar seem to be associated with a relatively
narrow-band variation of the pulse shape. Only parts of the integrated profile
participate in this process which suggests that the origin of this phenomenon
is intrinsic to the pulsar magnetosphere and unrelated to the interstellar
medium. A polarization study rules out profile changes due to geometrical
effects produced by any sort of precession. However, changes are observed in
the circularly polarized radiation component. In total we identify four
recycled pulsars which also exhibit instabilities in the total power or
polarization profiles due to an unknown phenomenon (PSRs J1022+1001,
J1730-2304, B1821-24, J2145-0750).
  The consequences for high precision pulsar timing are discussed in view of
the standard assumption that the integrated profiles of millisecond pulsars are
stable. As a result we present a new method to determine pulse times-of-arrival

profile. Applying this method to PSR J1022+1001, we obtain an improved timing
solution with a proper motion measurement of -17 \pm 2 mas/yr in ecliptic
longitude. Assuming a distance to the pulsar as inferred from the dispersion

apply it to U-dropouts at z ~ 3 found in the Hubble Deep Field. The method is
based on an observed correlation between the ratio of far infrared (FIR) to UV
fluxes with spectral slope \beta (a UV color). A simple fit to this relation
allows the UV flux absorbed by dust to be calculated, and hence the dust-free
UV luminosity to be determined. IUE spectra and IRAS fluxes of local starbursts
are used to calibrate the ratio in terms of 1600 Angstrom absorption A_{1600},
and the transformation from broad band color to \beta. We show that the recent
marginal and non-detections of HDF U-dropouts in the radio and sub-mm are
consistent with our calculated A_{1600}. This is also true of observations of
the ratio of optical emission line flux to UV flux density in the brightest
U-dropouts. This latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dust
extinction. In U-dropouts, absolute magnitude correlates with \beta: brighter
galaxies are redder, as is observed in local starburst galaxies. This suggests
that a mass-metallicity relationship is in place by z ~ 3. The UV luminosity
function of U-dropouts extends up to M_{1600,0} ~ -24 ABmag corresponding to a

invert the projection integral. From the surface (i.e. projected) brightness
profile one then formally recovers the original spatial distribution as a
function of the toroidal radius. 2) By applying the above-described inversion
formula, I show that if the projected profile is described by a truncated
off-center gaussian, the functional form of the related spatial emissivity is
very simple and - most important - nowhere negative for any value of the
gaussian parameters, a property which is not guaranteed - in general - by Abel
inversion. 3) Finally, I show how a generic multimodal centrally symmetric

for an increase in the frequency of line emission with X-ray luminosity. Purely
X-ray selected clusters at low redshift have a higher probability of containing
line emission. The more H-alpha luminous galaxies have larger emission-line
regions and show a higher ratio of Balmer to forbidden line emission, although
there is a continuous trend of ionization behaviour across four decades in
H-alpha luminosity. Galaxies with the more luminous line emission show a
significantly bluer continuum, whereas lower-luminosity and [NII]-only line
emitters have continua that differ little from those of non-line emitting
dominant galaxies. Values of the Balmer decrement in the more luminous systems
commonly imply intrinsic reddening of E(B-V)~0.3, and when this is corrected
for, the excess blue light can be characterized by a population of massive
young stars, which can also provide sufficient photoionization to produce the
observed H-alpha luminosity. The lower H-alpha luminosity systems show a higher
ionization state and few massive stars, requiring instead the introduction of a

to enable a precise measurement of the dispersion in the lithium abundance of
the Spite Li plateau. We concentrated on stars having a narrow range of
effective temperature and very low metallicities ([Fe/H] < -2.5) to reduce the
effects of systematic errors, and have made particular efforts to minimize
random errors in equivalent width and effective temperature. A typical formal
error for our abundances is 0.033 dex (1-sigma), which represents a factor of
two improvement on most previous studies. Our observed spread about the Li
Spite plateau is a mere 0.031 dex (1-sigma), hence we conclude the intrinsic
spread is effectively zero at the very metal-poor halo turnoff. We recover a
robust dependence of lithium abundance with metallicity, dA(Li)/d[Fe/H] = 0.118
+/- 0.023 dex per dex. Previous claims for a lack of dependence of A(Li) on
[Fe/H] are shown to have arisen from the use of noisier estimates of effective
temperatures and metallicities. Although we cannot rule out a uniform depletion
mechanism, the lack of spread in the A(Li) abundances limits permissible
depletion by current rotationally- induced mixing models to < 0.1 dex.
Correcting for the GCE contribution to both 6Li and 7Li, we infer a primordial
lithium abundance of A(Li) = 2.0 dex. We predict that observations of lithium
in extremely low-metallicity stars, having [Fe/H] < -3.0, will yield smaller
A(Li) values than the bulk of the stars in this sample, consistent with a low
primordial abundance.

to the TeV scale with the observed weakness of gravity at long distances being
due the existence of new sub-millimeter spatial dimensions. In this picture the
standard model fields are localized to a $(3+1)$-dimensional wall or
``3-brane''. We show that in such theories there exist attractive models of
inflation that occur while the size of the new dimensions are still small. We
show that it is easy to produce the required number of efoldings, and further
that the density perturbations $\delta\rho/\rho$ as measured by COBE can be
easily reproduced, both in overall magnitude and in their approximately
scale-invariant spectrum. In the minimal approach, the inflaton field is just
the moduli describing the size of the internal dimensions, the role of the
inflationary potential being played by the stabilizing potential of the
internal space. We show that under quite general conditions, the inflationary
era is followed by an epoch of contraction of our world on the brane, while the
internal dimensions slowly expand to their stabilization radius. We find a set
of exact solutions which describe this behavior, generalizing the well-known
Kasner solutions. During this phase, the production of bulk gravitons remains
suppressed. The period of contraction is terminated by the blue-shifting of
Hawking radiation left on our wall at the end of the inflationary de Sitter
phase. The temperature to which this is reheated is consistent with the
normalcy bounds. We give a precise definition of the radion moduli problem.

the Glauber approximation, to a simple formula for the density of hadrons

estimate of this density for RHIC and LHC is presented and compared with
results of Monte-Carlo calculations. It is shown that the Glauber approximation
substantially overestimate particle densities compared to the results of the

to large mass diffraction which leads to a strong decrease of particle
densities at mid rapidities. Our method of calculation of these effects has

good agreement with experimental data has been obtained.

anomaly matching on the lower-dimensional intersection of two orbifold planes
may require twisted matter on those planes which do not conventionally support
an anomaly (such as odd-dimensional planes). In this way, gravitational
anomalies can, in principle, tell us about (twisted) gauge groups on subspaces
which are not necessarily ten-, six- or two-dimensional. An example is worked
out for the case of an $S^1/{\bf Z}_2\times T^4/{\bf Z}_2$ orbifold and

only Einstein term and cosmological constant but also curvature squared terms.
The explicit expression for two-dimensional and four-dimensional anomalies is
found, it contains higher derivative corrections. In particular, it is shown
that not only Einstein gravity but also theory with the Lagrangian
$L=aR^2+bR_{\mu\nu}R^{\mu\nu} + \Lambda$ (even when a=0 or b=0) is

Bethe-Salpeter equation beyond the instantaneous approximation and Salpeter's
equation. The more usual method consists in performing an expansion around an
instantaneous approximation of the product of the free propagators
(propagator-approximated reduction). The second method starts with an
instantaneous approximation of the Bethe-Salpeter kernel (kernel-approximated
reduction). In both reductions the final 3D potential can be obtained by
following simple modified Feynman rules. The kernel-approximated reduction,
however, does not give the correct scattering amplitudes, and must thus be
limited to the computation of bound states. Our 3D reduction of the
three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation is inspired by these results. We expand
this equation around positive-energy instantaneous approximations of the three
two-body kernels, but these starting approximations are given by
propagator-approximated reductions at the two-body level. The three-fermion
Bethe-Salpeter equation is first transformed into a set of three coupled
equations for three wave functions depending each on one two-fermion total
energy, then into a set of three 3D equations and finally into a single 3D
equation. This last equation is rather complicated, as it combines three series
expansions, but we use it to write a manageable expression of the first-order
corrections to the energy spectrum.
