cloud groups separated by radial velocities which at some points approach 400

[SII]6716+6731/H-alpha, and [NII]6583/H-alpha in these clouds show no evidence
for the type of HII region emission associated with starburst activity in
either velocity system. The measured emission line ratios are similar to those
found in the nuclei of narrow-line radio galaxies, but the extended
ionization/excitation cannot be produced by continuum emission from the active
nucleus alone. We present arguments which suggest that the velocity
disturbances seen in the EELG are most likely the result of a galaxy-galaxy
collision or merger but cannot completely rule out the possibility that the gas
has been disrupted by the passage of a radio jet.

yield line ratios for the ionized gas which have anomalously low [NII] (6564),
suggesting either a complex, clumpy structure in the gas with a higher
cloud-covering factor at larger radii and with denser clouds than is found in
the nuclear regions of most NLRG and Seyfert 2 galaxies, or some other,
unmodeled, mechanism for the emergent spectrum from this region. The H-alpha
emission-line filaments to the N appear to be associated with a 3 cm radio
continuum knot which lies in a gap in the filaments ~ 4"" from the nucleus.

separated from the host we have been able to confirm spectroscopically that
they are indeed at the same redshift as the radio galaxy. However, a
quantitative analysis of the alignment in this sample and in a corresponding 3C

  If the stellar activity is somehow related to the formation of shells, as
predicted by several dynamical models of galaxy interaction, shells have to be
considered long lasting structures.
  Since pair members show evidence of very recent star formation, we suggest
that either large reservoirs of gas have to be present to maintain active star
formation, if these galaxies are on periodic orbits, or most of the pair
members in the present sample are experiencing unbound encounters.

temperature of the gas is much reduced and the cooling time was reduced by a
factor of 2. At lower temperatures, we are especially interested in the
production of molecular Hydrogen and so we follow the ionization level and H_2
abundance across the shock. This regime is particularly relevent to simulations
of primordial galaxy formation for halos in which the virial temperature of the
galaxy is sufficiently high to partially re-ionize the gas. The effect of
in-shock cooling is substantial: the maximum temperature the gas reaches
compared to the theoretical temperature was found to vary between 0.15 and 0.81
for the simulations performed. The downstream ionization level is reduced from
the theoretical level by a factor of between 2.4 and 12.5, and the resulting
H_2 abundance was found to be reduced to a fraction of 0.45 to 0.74 of its
theoretical value. At temperatures above 10^5K, radiative shocks are unstable

analysis of the data reveals a tendency of the amplitude of variations to
increase with energy, and the presence of a soft lag with a timescale of the
order 10^3 s. A curved continuum spectrum, with no evidence of spectral
features, extends up to ~50 keV, while there is indication of a flatter
component emerging at higher energies, consistent with the interpretation of
the broad band spectral energy distribution (SED) as due to synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) emission from a single region. Notably, the fitting of the
SED with such a model is consistent with an interpretation of the detected soft
lag as due to radiative cooling, supporting the idea that radiation losses play
an important role in variability. The observed shifts of the SED peaks between
the lowest and highest flux levels can be accounted for by an increase of the
break energy in the relativistic particle spectrum. The model predicts emission
at TeV energies in good agreement with the recently reported detection.

of same length. In the Kondo regime the current scales as $L^{-1/2}$, unlike
the $L^{-1}$ scaling of a perfect ring. We discuss the possibility of detection
of the Kondo effect by means of a persistent current measurement.

lattice spin models is presented. It is shown that it can give a number of
methods, including the DMRG method, that can be used to find generally
inhomogeneous solutions of 2D classical lattice problems. A method, closely
related the DMRG method but without necessity to perform any renormalization,
is derived, yielding results practically not different from the DMRG ones. The
matrix-product wave function of Rommer and \""Ostlund can be constructed from
the output of the method. The computational costs of all the derived methods
are smaller than those of the DMRG. Most of the results are applicable to the
1D quantum systems, as well.

Ginzburg-Landau expansions beyond 4th order. The tetracritical point in the B-T

particular choice of radial ``wavefunction'' - the hydrogenic solutions - and
we find good stability for both fitted masses and amplitudes of the radially

demonstrated to be well understood, while near optimal smearing radii may be
found with extremely low statistics using a property of the smeared-local

achieves a good signal to noise ratio, and can be altered to use wavefunctions
from, say, potential models or the Bethe-Salpether equations in future

strong U(1) coupling. We argue that current experiments limit this coupling to
be relatively large. The model is dynamically broken to the Standard $SU(2)_L
\otimes U(1)$ model at the scale of a few TeV with all the extra gauge bosons
and the exotic quarks acquiring masses much larger than the scale of
electroweak symmetry breaking. Furthermore we find that the model leads to
large dynamical mass of the top quark and hence also breaks the electroweak
gauge symmetry. It therefore leads to large dynamical effects within the
Standard model and can partially replace the Higgs interactions.

to that of the Jaynes-Cummings model. The strong spin-orbit coupling of the
Dirac oscillator produces the entanglement of the spin with the orbital motion
similar to what is observed in the model of quantum optics. The collapses and
revivals of the spin which result extend to a relativistic theory our previous
findings on nonrelativistic oscillator where they were known under the name of
`spin-orbit pendulum'. There are important relativistic effects (lack of
periodicity, zitterbewegung, negative energy states). Many of them disappear
after a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.

by Bouwmeester {\em et al}. [Nature {\bf 390}, 575 (1997)] and the adjustments
to it suggested by Braunstein and Kimble [Nature {\bf 394}, 841 (1998)]. These
suggestions include the employment of a detector cascade and a relative
slow-down of one of the two down-converters. We show that coincidences between
photon-pairs from parametric down-conversion automatically probe the
non-Poissonian structure of these sources. Furthermore, we find that detector
cascading is of limited use, and that modifying the relative strengths of the
down-conversion efficiencies will increase the time of the experiment to the
order of weeks. Our analysis therefore points to the benefits of single-photon
detectors in non-post-selected type experiments, a technology currently
requiring roughly $6^{\circ}$K operating conditions.
