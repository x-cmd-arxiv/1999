We find no evidence of a periodic signal that could corroborate the existence

companion mass ranging from 1.1 to 22 M_{Jup} at orbital periods of 0.75 to
3000 d, i.e. separations 0.008-2 AU from Prox Cen. Our mass limits concur with
limits found by precise astrometry (Benedict et al. 1998a and priv. comm.)
which strongly constrain the period range 50-600 d to 1.1-0.22 M_{Jup}.
Combining both results we exclude a brown dwarf or supermassive planet at
separations 0.008-0.69 AU from Prox Cen. We also find that, at the level of our
precision, the RV data are not affected by stellar activity.

small (planetary) mass ratios q is studied. It is shown how the limit of a
(pure shear) Chang-Refsdal lens is approached, under what conditions the
Chang-Refsdal approximation is valid, and how the 3 different topologies of the
critical curves and caustics for a binary lens are mapped onto the 2 different
topologies for a Chang-Refsdal lens with pure shear. It is shown that for wide
binaries, the lensing in the vicinity of both lens objects can be described by
a Taylor-expansion of the deflection term due to the other object, where the
Chang-Refsdal approximation corresponds to a truncation of this series. For
close binaries, only the vicinity of the secondary, less massive, object can be
described in this way. However, for image distances much larger than the
separation of the lens objects, any binary lens can be approximated by means of
multipole expansion, where the first non-trivial term is the quadrupole term.
It is shown that an ambiguity exists between wide and close binary lenses,
where the shear at one of the objects due to the other object for the wide
binary is equal to the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the quadrupole
moment for the close binary. This analysis provides the basis for a
classification of binary lens microlensing events, especially of planetary
events, and an understanding of present ambiguities.

selected sample of the radio sources, while spectroscopic observations have

imply that most of the emission line sources are star-forming galaxies, with a
small contribution (\approx 10%) from Sy1/Sy2 type objects. We also find a
significant number of absorption line systems, likely to be ellipticals. These
dominate at high flux densities (> 1 mJy) but are also found at sub-mJy levels.
Using the Balmer decrement we find a visual extinction A_{V}=1.0 for the
star-forming faint radio sources. This moderate reddening is consistent with
the V-R and R-K colours of the optically identified sources. For emission line
galaxies, there is a correlation between the radio power and the H\alpha

that the radio emission of starburst radio galaxies is a good indicator of

(E(B-V)=0.55mag from nebular and stellar techniques). This implies that the
planetary nebula of M4-18 has a dynamical age of 3100 years, in contrast to

ratio. Rotation is low in all three galaxies, and NGC 6173 and NGC 6086 show
possible kinematically decoupled cores. All three galaxies have Mg2 gradients
similar to those found in normal bright ellipticals, which are not steep enough
to support simple dissipative collapse models, but these could be accompanied
by dissipationless mergers which would tend to dilute the abundance gradients.
The [Mg/Fe] ratios in NGC 6166 and NGC 6086 are higher than that in NGC 6173,
and if NGC 6173 is typical of normal bright ellipticals, this suggests that cDs
cannot form from late mergers of normal galaxies.

interesting fact that free charge carriers, generated e.g. by nitrogen doping,
are a very common characteristics of many SiC particle samples. These free
charge carriers produce very strong plasmon absorption in the near and middle
infrared, which may also heavily influence the 10-13 micron feature profile via
plasmon-phonon coupling.

itself to the $\alpha$ formalsim, but transport by self-gravity does not.
Nonlocal transport is an intrinsic property of turbulent self-gravitating
disks, which in general cannot be captured by an $\alpha$ model. Local energy
dissipation and $\alpha$-like behavior can be re-established if the pattern
speeds associated with the amplitudes of an azimuthal Fourier decomposition of
the turbulence are everywhere close to the local rotation frequency. In this
situation, global wave transport must be absent. Shearing box simulations,
which employ boundary conditions forcing local behavior, are probably not an
adequate tool for modeling the behavior of self-gravitating disks. As a matter
of principle, it is possible that disks which hover near the edge of

a binary system formed by a neutron star and an O/B/WR companion in which the
energy of the GRB is due to the accretion-induced collapse of the neutron star
to a black hole. The high speed in the energy flow in AGN-jets is generally
believed to be initiated by strong magnetic field coupling to the accretion
disk of the black hole. We use the same mechanism here. We assume that in this
transition a large amount of energy is anisotropically released as Poynting
flux along the polar axis. One may think of this process as a violent and rapid
twist. This energy release naturally initiates an ultrarelativistic shock wave
in the pre-existing jet. The emission microphysics are as in fireball models.
Our model has only two parameters overall, the energy in the shock along the
jet, and the fraction of this energy in energetic electrons and positrons. The
system SS433 appears to have the properties required for a GRB precursor in our

the HII galaxy-APM galaxy angular cross-correlation function, but the amplitude

between the excited atoms as described by the Uehling-Uhlenbeck ($C_{22}$)

can be used to derive hydrodynamic equations for the non-condensate. These

a new relaxational mode associated with the exchange of atoms between the two

time of the equilibration process. This process provides an additional source
of damping of the collective modes (first and second sound in the case of a

found experimentally to differ qualitatively from simple-model behavior. In the
absence of ab initio theory, the surprises embodied in the experimental data
were imputed to effects of dynamical correlations. We summarize results of ab
initio investigations of linear response, performed within time-dependent
density-functional theory (TDDFT), in which the unexpected features of the
observed spectra are shown to be due to band-structure effects. Contrary to
conventional wisdom, the response cannot be understood ""universally,"" in terms
of a simple scaling with the density, on going from metal to metal (e.g.,
through the alkali series) --even the shape of the dispersion curve for the
plasmon energy is system-specific. The second part of this article starts out
with the observation that a similar ab initio study of systems with more
complex electronic structures would require the availability of a realistic
approximation for the dynamical many-body kernel entering the density-response
function in TDDFT. Thus, we outline a diagrammatic alternative, framed within
the conserving-approximation method of Baym and Kadanoff. Using as a benchmark
the band gap of Si obtained in the GW approximation, together with a
diagrammatic (and conserving) solution of the ensuing Bethe-Salpeter equation,
we discuss issues involving conservation laws, self-consistency, and sum rules.
These conceptual issues are particularly important for the development of ab
initio methods for the study of dynamical response and quasiparticle band
structure of strongly-correlated materials. We argue that inclusion of
short-range correlations absent in the GW approximation is a must, even in Si.

metastabilities are investigated numerically for several representative values
of the upstream boundary flux $f_{up}$ and for the whole range of the on-ramp

localized cluster state) is found and related to a recently measured traffic
state. Due to the density gradient near the on-ramp, a novel traffic jam can
occur even when the downstream density is below the critical density of the
usual traffic jam formation in homogeneous highways, and its structure varies
qualitatively with $f_{rmp}$. The free flow, the recurring hump (RH) state, and
the traffic jam can all coexist in a certain metastable region where the free
flow can undergo phase transitions either to the RH state or to the traffic jam
state. We also find two nontrivial analytic solutions. These solutions
correspond to the standing localized cluster state and the homogeneous
congested traffic state (one form of the novel traffic jam),which are observed
in numerical simulations.

quasi-two-dimensional magnetic materials are reviewed. These materials can be
modelled by the classical two-dimensional anisotropic Heisenberg model with XY
(easy-plane) symmetry. There are two types of vortices, characterized by their
polarization (a second topological charge in addition to the vorticity): Planar
vortices have Newtonian dynamics (even-order equations of motion) and exhibit
strong discreteness effects, while non-planar vortices have non-Newtonian
dynamics (odd-order equations of motion) and smooth trajectories. The influence
of thermal fluctuations on single vortices is investigated. Different types of
noise and damping are discussed and implemented into the microscopic equations
which yields stochastic equations of motion for the vortices. The solutions of
the these equations are compared with Langevin dynamics simulations. Moreover,
noise-induced transitions between opposite polarizations of a vortex are
investigated. For temperatures above the Kosterlitz-Thouless vortex-antivortex
unbinding transition, a phenomenological theory, namely the vortex gas
approach, yields central peaks in the dynamic form factors for the spin
correlations. Such peaks are observed both in combined Monte Carlo- and Spin
Dynamics-Simulations and in inelastic neutron scattering experiments. However,
the assumption of ballistic vortex motion appears questionable.

serves to provide us with its potential resolution. We present an alternate
cosmology, one based on conformal gravity, and show that once given only that
the sign of the vacuum energy density $\Lambda$ is explicitly the negative one
associated with spontaneous breakdown of the scale invariance of the conformal
theory (this actually being the choice of sign for $\Lambda$ which precisely
leads to cosmic acceleration in conformal gravity), then that alone, no matter
how big $\Lambda$ might actually be in magnitude, is sufficient to not only
make its measurable contribution to current era cosmology naturally be of order
one today, but to even do so in a way which is completely compatible with the
recent high $z$ supernovae cosmology data. Cosmology can thus live with either
a fundamental $G$ or with the large (and even potentially negative) $\Lambda$
associated with elementary particle physics phase transitions but not with
both. Also, we distinguish between the free energy and the internal energy,
with it being the former which determines cosmological phase transitions and
the latter which is the source of the gravitational field. Then we show that,
even if we make the standard ad hoc assumption that $\Lambda$ actually is
quenched in standard gravity, vacuum energy is nonetheless still found to
dominate standard cosmology at the time of the phase transition which produced
it. However, within conformal gravity no such difficulty is encountered.

from various experiments, in order to obtain a phenomenological understanding
of neutrino mass textures. We then investigate how the required patterns of
neutrino masses and mixings are related to the flavour structure of the
underlying theory. In supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model,
renormalisation group effects can have important implications: for small tanb,
bottom-tau unification indicates the presence of significant muon-tau flavour
mixing. The evolution of the neutrino mixing may be described by simple
semi-analytic expressions, which confirm that, for large tanb, very small
mixing at the GUT scale may be amplified to maximal mixing at low energies, and
vice versa. Passing to specific models, we first discuss the predictions for
neutrino masses in different GUT models (including superstring-embedded
solutions). Imposing the requirement for successful leptogenesis may give
additional constraints on the generic structure of the neutrino mass textures.
Finally, we discuss direct ways to look for lepton-number violation in
ultra-high energy neutrino interactions.

fields. It is shown that the ghost fields are indispensable in deriving
well-defined antiderivatives and in regularizing the most singular component of
gauge field propagator. To this end it is sufficient to confine ourselves to
noninteracting abelian fields. Furthermore to circumvent dealing with
constrained systems, we construct the temporal gauge canonical formulation of
the free electromagnetic field in auxiliary coordinates
$x^{\mu}=(x^-,x^+,x^1,x^2)$ where $x^-=x^0 cos{\theta}-x^3 sin{\theta}, x^+=x^0
sin{\theta}+x^3 cos{\theta}$ and $x^-$ plays the role of time. In so doing we
can quantize the fields canonically without any constraints, unambiguously
introduce ""static ghost fields"" as residual gauge degrees of freedom and
construct the light-cone gauge solution in the light-cone representation by
simply taking the light-cone limit (${\theta}\to \pi/4$). As a by product we
find that, with a suitable choice of vacuum the Mandelstam-Leibbrandt form of
the propagator can be derived in the ${\theta}=0$ case (the temporal gauge

the $\rho$-meson in nuclear matter. In a calculation of the in-medium
spectralfunction of the $\rho$ we find that it is strongly modified by baryonic
resonances, especially the $D_{13}(1520)$, through its coupling to
resonance-hole states. In order to test the predictions of a model for the
in-medium properties of the $\rho$-meson so far mostly heavy-ion collision have
been used. We argue that the coherent photoproduction of $\rho$-mesons yields
additional information about the nature of the medium modification. It can be
shown that the production amplitude is sensitive on the momentum dependence of
the $\rho$-selfenergy. This can be used to distinguish experimentally between
various models for the $\rho$ in matter.
