the Advanced Satellite for Astrophysics and Cosmology ASCA and the ROSAT
Position Sensitive Proportional Counter (PSPC). By correcting for the
energy-dependent point-spread function of the ASCA instruments, we have
examined the temperature structure of the cluster. The cluster's core within 3'
is found to have a temperature of 6.46+-0.87 keV, significantly higher than
3.10+-1.19 keV in the surrounding region of r = 3 - 6'. This radially
decreasing temperature structure can be parameterized by a polytropic index of
$\gamma$ $\simeq$ 1.45. The X-ray morphology of the cluster appears elongated
and clumpy on scales $\le$1'. These results, together with earlier {\it ROSAT}
and optical studies which revealed that the X-ray centroid and ellipticity of
A2111 shift with spatial scale, are consistent with the hypothesis that the
cluster is a dynamically young system. Most likely, the cluster has recently
undergone a merger, which may also be responsible for the high fraction of blue
galaxies observed in the cluster. Alternatively, the temperature structure may
also be due to the gravitational potential of the cluster. We have further
measured the emission weighted abundance of the X-ray-emitting intracluster
medium as 0.25$\pm$0.14 solar. This value is similar to those of nearby
clusters which do not show a large blue galaxy fraction, indicating that star
formation in disk galaxies and subsequent loss to the medium do not drastically
alter the average abundance of a cluster. This is consistent with recent
results which indicate that cluster abundances have remained constant since at
least z ~ 0.3.

characteristics of both, a Wolf-Rayet and an O-type star, implying that these
two type of stars may be present in the system. The lack of coherent modulation
(pulsations) and the relatively soft and low luminosity X-ray emission seems to
exclude the presence of a neutron star as the body generating the X-ray
emission. We present the first X-ray energy spectrum of this source at energies
above 3 keV and discuss the implications of the spectral parameters obtained
from the model fitting. We comment on the fact that the iron lines in CWB are
centred at higher energies, ~ 6.6 keV, than those detected in supergiant HMXB,

  (Armenia) ""Activity in galaxies and related phenomena""",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Giant radio galaxies are thought to be massive ellipticals powered by
accretion of interstellar matter onto a supermassive black hole. Interactions
with gas rich galaxies may provide the interstellar matter to feed the active
galactic nucleus (AGN). To power radio lobes that extend up to distances of
hundreds of kiloparsecs, gas has to be funneled from kiloparsec size scales
down to the AGN at rates of ~1 Mo yr^-1 during >10^8 years. Therefore, large
and massive quasi-stable structures of gas and dust should exist in the deep
interior of the giant elliptical hosts of double lobe radio galaxies. Recent
mid-infrared observations with ISO revealed for the first time a bisymmetric
spiral structure with the dimensions of a small galaxy at the centre of
Centaurus A (Mirabel et al. 1999, A&A 341, 667). The spiral was formed out of
the tidal debris of accreted gas-rich object(s) and has a dust morphology that
is remarkably similar to that found in barred spiral galaxies. The observations
of the closest AGN to Earth suggest that the dusty hosts of giant radio
galaxies like CenA, are ""symbiotic"" galaxies composed of a barred spiral inside
an elliptical, where the bar serves to funnel gas toward the AGN.

XVIII and Fe XIX Dn=0 DR DR rate coefficients. Significant discrepancies exist
between our inferred rates and those of published calculations. These
calculations overestimate the DR rates by factors of ~2 or underestimate it by
factors of ~2 to orders of magnitude, but none are in good agreement with our
results. Almost all published DR rates for modeling cosmic plasmas are computed
using the same theoretical techniques as the above-mentioned calculations.
Hence, our measurements call into question all theoretical Dn=0 DR rates used
for ionization balance calculations of cosmic plasmas. At temperatures where
the Fe XVIII and Fe XIX fractional abundances are predicted to peak in
photoionized gases of cosmic abundances, the theoretical rates underestimate
the Fe XVIII DR rate by a factor of ~2 and overestimate the Fe XIX DR rate by a
factor of ~1.6. We have carried out new multiconfiguration Dirac-Fock and
multiconfiguration Breit-Pauli calculations which agree with our measured
resonance strengths and rate coefficients to within typically better than
<~30%. We provide a fit to our inferred rate coefficients for use in plasma
modeling. Using our DR measurements, we infer a factor of ~2 error in the Fe XX
through Fe XXIV Dn=0 DR rates. We investigate the effects of this estimated
error for the well-known thermal instability of photoionized gas. We find that
errors in these rates cannot remove the instability, but they do dramatically
affect the range in parameter space over which it forms.

itinerant magnetism (and is sensitive to choice of exchange-correlation

that is induced in the Cu-O layers, the system seems capable of supporting
singlet superconductivity an FFLO-type order parameter and possibly a pi-phase
alternation between layers. If instead the pairing is triplet in the RuO2

of superconductivity seems to imply a spontaneous vortex phase if the

Interaction with the substrate or with other tubes does not alter the
scanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM) patterns observed for isolated tubes.
STM-topographic images of topological defects (pentagon/heptagon pair) and
tube-caps have also been studied. In both cases the obtained image depends on
the sign of the applied voltage and it can be described in terms of the
previous catalog of STM-images (interference between electronic waves scattered
by the defect). We also have computed the electronic density of states for
isolated tubes with different chiralities and radii confirming a correlation
between the peak-structure in the DOS and the nanotube diameter, however the
metallic plateau in the DOS also depends on the nanotube chirality.
Furthermore, the conduction and valence band structures are not fully
symmetrical to one another. In contrast to STM images, the interaction with the
substrate does modify the energy levels of the nanotube. We observe opening of
small pseudogaps around the Fermi level and broadening of the sharp van Hove
singularities of the isolated single-walled-nanotubes that can be used to
extract useful information about the tube structure and bonding. The
combination of STM and spectroscopic studies opens a new technique to address

the vortices (called P-vortices) form connected two dimensional surfaces on the

tension. All of the huge vortices detected in several thousand field
configurations turn out to be unorientable. We determine the Euler

After removal of unimportant short range fluctuations they consist only of

apply this analysis to convergent sequences of Kleinian groups, in order to
understand when the visual core of the algebraic limit manifold embeds in the

discontinuity of the algebraic limit of such a sequence is non-empty. We
further show, with the same assumptions, that the limit sets of the groups in
the sequence converge to the limit set of the algebraic limit. As a corollary,
we verify the conjecture for finitely generated Kleinian groups which are not
(non-trivial) free products of surface groups and infinite cyclic groups.

  author. Completely rewritten from version 1, with many new results added",,,,"math.QA",,"  In the 1980's, Belavin and Drinfeld classified solutions r of the classical
Yang-Baxter equation (CYBE) for simple Lie algebras \mathfrak g satisfying 0
\neq r + r_{21} \in (S^2 \mathfrak{g})^{\mathfrak{g}}. They proved that all
such solutions fall into finitely many continuous families and introduced
combinatorial objects to label these families, Belavin-Drinfeld triples. In
1993, Gerstenhaber, Giaquinto, and Schack attempted to quantize such solutions
for Lie algebras \mathfrak{sl}(n). As a result, they formulated a conjecture
stating that certain explicitly given elements R \in Mat_n(\mathbb C) \otimes
Mat_n(\mathbb C) satisfy the quantum Yang-Baxter equation (QYBE) and the Hecke
relation. Specifically, the conjecture assigns a family of such elements R to
any Belavin-Drinfeld triple of type A_{n-1}. Following a suggestion from
Gerstenhaber and Giaquinto, we propose an alternate form for R, given by R_J =
q^{r^0} J^{-1} R_s J_{21} q^{r^0}, for a suitable twist J and a diagonal matrix
r^0, where R_s is the standard Drinfeld-Jimbo solution of the QYBE. We
formulate the ``twist conjecture'', which states that R_J = R_{\text{GGS}} and
that R_J satisfies the QYBE. Since R_J by construction satisfies the Hecke
relation, this conjecture implies the GGS conjecture. We check the twist
conjecture by computer for n \leq 12 and show that it is true modulo \hbar^3.
We provide combinatorial formulas for coefficients in the matrices R_J,
R_{\text{GGS}} and prove both conjectures in the disjoint case---when \Gamma_1
\cap \Gamma_2 = \emptyset---and in the orthogonal generalized disjoint case,
which is a generalization of \Gamma_1 \perp \Gamma_2. Finally, we prove the
twist conjecture for the Cremmer-Gervais triple and discuss cases in which it
is known that R_J = R_{\text{GGS}}.

  new papers \cite{Tur99Equi} and \cite{Zakh99Kro}, expanded bibliography on
  ``classical'' bi-Hamiltonian systems, and minor stylistic corrections. The

  change. To be published in Selecta Math",,,,"math.DG math-ph math.MP",,"  We introduce a criterion that a given bihamiltonian structure allows a local
coordinate system where both brackets have constant coefficients. This
criterion is applied to the bihamiltonian open Toda lattice in a generic point,
which is shown to be locally isomorphic to a Kronecker odd-dimensional pair of
brackets with constant coefficients. This shows that the open Toda lattice
cannot be locally represented as a product of two bihamiltonian structures.
  In a generic point the bihamiltonian periodic Toda lattice is shown to be
isomorphic to a product of two open Toda lattices (one of which is a (trivial)
structure of dimension 1).
  While the above results might be obtained by more traditional methods, we use
an approach based on general results on geometry of webs. This demonstrates a
possibility to apply a geometric language to problems on bihamiltonian
integrable systems, such a possibility may be no less important than the
particular results proven in this paper.
  Based on these geometric approaches, we conjecture that decompositions
similar to the decomposition of the periodic Toda lattice exist in local
geometry of the Volterra system, the complete Toda lattice, the
multidimensional Euler top, and a regular bihamiltonian Lie coalgebra. We also
state general conjectures about geometry of more general ``homogeneous''
finite-dimensional bihamiltonian structures.
  The class of homogeneous structures is shown to coincide with the class of
system integrable by Lenard scheme. The bihamiltonian structures which allow a
non-degenerate Lax structure are shown to be locally isomorphic to the open
Toda lattice.
