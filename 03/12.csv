only weakly constrained by one-dimensional data. Barred galaxies are
intrinsically more complicated, but provide much tighter constraints on the
disk masses and support the idea that most of the mass in the inner parts of
bright galaxies is in their stars. There appears to be no systematic difference
in dark matter content between barred and unbarred galaxies, consistent with
the theoretical result that the global stability of galaxies with dense centers
does not depend on their halo fraction. The rotation curve shapes of lower
luminosity and low-surface-brightness galaxies, on the other hand, indicate
significant mass in the DM halo even near their centers. We find that most DM
halos appear to have large cores, inconsistent with the predictions from
cosmological simulations. We also show that such large-core halos can result
from compression by disk infall of physically reasonable initial halos. Maximum
disks, while apparently required by the data, do seem to present some puzzles;
most notably they re-open the old disk-halo ``conspiracy'' issue and
incorrectly predict that surface brightness should be a second parameter in the

dark matter makes an insignificant contribution to the inner part of the
rotation curve. (2) I then briefly discuss interactions between disturbances in
the discs of galaxies and the spherical components, which generally exert a
damping effect through dynamical friction. The fact that bars in real galaxies
appear to rotate quite rapidly, seems to require dark matter halos to have
large, low-density cores. (3) In the remainder of the article, I consider the
theory of spiral structure. The new development here is that the distribution
function for stars in the Solar neighbourhood, as measured by HIPPARCOS, is far
less smooth than most theoretical work had previously supposed. The strong
variations in the values of the \DF over small ranges in angular momentum have
the appearance of having been caused by scattering at Lindblad resonances with
spiral patterns. This result, if confirmed when the radial velocity data become
available, supports the picture of spiral patterns as dynamical instabilities
driven by substructure in the \DF. The details of how decaying patterns might
seed conditions for a new instability remain unclear, and deserve fresh

right-moving electrons with spin has an SO(4) symmetry, and can be written as
four interacting Majorana fermions, each with the same velocity. We have found
a method for solving some cases when the velocities of these Majorana fermions

corrections to the non skeleton self-energy identically vanish for these

model can be solved by bosonization, our method can be explicitly checked.
However, we are also able to solve some new cases where the excitation spectrum
differs qualitatively from a Luttinger liquid.
  Of particular interest, is the so-called SO(3) model, where a triplet of
Majorana fermions moving at one velocity, interact with a single Majorana
fermion moving at another velocity. We show using our method, that a sharp

covariance matrix. This nonlinear covariance matrix is chiseled to the specific
fat tail structure of the underlying marginal distributions, thus ensuring
stability and good-conditionning. The portfolio distribution is obtained as the
solution of a mapping to a so-called phi-q field theory in particle physics, of
which we offer an extensive treatment using Feynman diagrammatic techniques and
large deviation theory, that we illustrate in details for multivariate Weibull
distributions. The main result of our theory is that minimizing the portfolio
variance (i.e. the relatively ``small'' risks) may often increase the large
risks, as measured by higher normalized cumulants. Extensive empirical tests
are presented on the foreign exchange market that validate satisfactorily the
theory. For ``fat tail'' distributions, we show that an adequete prediction of

approaches that can be applied to systems large enough to act as realistic
models of solids. In attempts to use fixed-node DMC for excited-state
calculations, it has often been assumed that the DMC energy must be greater

symmetry as the trial function. We show that this assumption is not justified
unless the trial function transforms according to a one-dimensional irreducible
representation of the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian. If the trial function
transforms according to a multi-dimensional irreducible representation,
corresponding to a degenerate energy level, the DMC energy may lie below the
energy of the lowest eigenstate of that symmetry. Weaker variational bounds may
then be obtained by choosing trial functions transforming according to
one-dimensional irreducible representations of subgroups of the full symmetry

G_NS compared to the normal state conductance G_N for ideal interfaces may be
suppressed for interfaces with a quantum point contact with only a few
propagating modes. The suppression is found to depend strongly on the position
of the Fermi level. We also study the suppression due to a barrier at the
interface and find an anomalous behavior caused by quasiparticle interference.
Finally, we consider the limit of sequential tunneling and find a suppression
of the factor-of-two enhancement which may explain the absence of conductance
enhancement in experiments on metal-superconductor structures.

dynamics is governed by a generic DBI action including a WZ term, which couples
to the SUGRA background of the other brane. The analysis naturally reveals two
types of configurations: the ``marginal'' and the ``non-marginal'' ones. We
specify possible configurations for a pair of similar or non-similar branes in
either of these two categories. In particular, for two similar branes at
angles, this analysis reveals that all the marginal configurations are
specified by SU(2) angles while the non-marginal configurations are specified
by $Sp(2)$ angles. On the other hand, we find that no other configuration of
two intersecting branes at non-trivial angles can be constructed out of flat
p-branes. So in particular, two non-similar branes can only be found in an
orthogonal configuration. In this case the intersection rules for either of the

subgroup $K$ acting on the right and under the discrete U-duality subgroup
$E_{10}(Z)$ on the left. The manifold $E_{10}(Z)\backslash E_{10}(R) /K$

U(n), N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory on $T^4$, with generic SO(6) R-symmetry

setting other variables to the R-symmetry twists and the radii of $T^4$. In

of the first, that is there are much more Haken manifolds than expected by
Thurston. In fact Freedman showed very recently that big ramified coverings are
Haken. A version of his proof with various improvements was obtained by
Cooper-Long and Cooper-Long-Reid.
  The two main contributions of the present paper are the following. I give an
analytic proof of Freedman's result and the improved version of

Freedman's and is 10 times shorter, but uses the full forse of the
hyperbolization theorem.

Morover any knot becomes tight after a big surgery. So any ramified covering of
a big surgery is Haken.

measure the local positivity of ample line bundles. Recent interest in Seshadri
constants stems on the one hand from the fact that bounds on Seshadri constants
yield, via vanishing theorems, bounds on the number of points and jets that
adjoint linear series separate. On the other hand it has become increasingly
clear by now that Seshadri constants are highly interesting invariants quite in
their own right. Except in the simplest cases, however, they are already in the
case of surfaces very hard to control or to compute explicitly---hardly any
explicit values of Seshadri constants are known so far. The purpose of the
present paper is to study these invariants on algebraic surfaces. On the one
hand, we prove a number of explicit bounds for Seshadri constants and Seshadri
submaximal curves, and on the other hand, we give complete results for abelian
surfaces of Picard number one. A nice feature of this result is that it allows
to explicitly compute the Seshadri constants---as well as the unique
irreducible curve that accounts for it---for a whole class of surfaces. It also
shows that Seshadri constants have an intriguing number-theoretic flavor in
this case.

density yielded a new, non-local Quantum Electrodynamics. In this letter we
show that as a consequence of this new QED, a blackbody radiation viewed
through gaseous matter appears to show a slight deviation from the Planck
formula, and propose an experimental test to check this effect. We also show
that a non-uniformity in this gaseous matter distribution leads to an
(apparent) spatial anisotropy in the blackbody radiation.

we may produce interactions similar to the ones describing ferro-magnetism in
condensed matter physics. We also show that particularly simple choices of the
interaction lead to spin-squeezing, which may be used to improve the
sensitivity of atomic clocks. Spin-squeezing is generated even with partially,
and randomly, filled lattices, and our proposal may be implemented with current
technology.
