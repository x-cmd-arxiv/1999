at several hundred KeV are produced on very compact scales, where photon
production is limited by blackbody effects and/or the requirement of energetic
quanta ($E>2m_e c^2$) for efficient further production. The fast variation of
order milliseconds in the time profile is then a natural expectation, given the
other observed GRB parameters. Analytic calculations are presented to show that
the escape of non-thermal, energetic gamma rays can emerge within a second of
the thermal photons from a gammasphere of below $10^{12}$ cm. The minimum
asymptotic bulk Lorentz factor in this model is found to be of order several
hundred if the photosphere is of order $3 \times 10^{11}$ cm and greater for
larger or smaller photospheric radii. It is suggested that prompt UHE gamma
rays might provide a new constraint on the asymptotic Lorentz factor of the
outflow.

such a simple system shows a rich variety of behavior, including high-period
oscillations and chaos. Border-collision bifurcations and multifractal
fragmentation of the phase space is also observed for a range of parameter

certain restrictive assumptions, which makes the resultant network dynamics
effectively one-dimensional. Possible applications of the network for
information processing are outlined. These include using the network for
auto-association, pattern classification, nonlinear function approximation and
periodic sequence generation.

near an impenetrable boundary, representing the flask containing the reactants.
Two types of dynamics are considered for the reactants: diffusive and ballistic
propagation. It is shown that the effect of the boundary is quite different in
both cases: diffusion-reaction leads to a density excess, whereas ballistic
annihilation exhibits a density deficit, and in both cases the effect is not
localized at the boundary but penetrates into the system. The field-theoretic
renormalization group is used to obtain the universal properties of the density
excess in two dimensions and below for the reaction-diffusion system. In one
dimension the excess decays with the same exponent as the bulk and is found by
an exact solution. In two dimensions the excess is marginally less relevant
than the bulk decay and the density profile is again found exactly for late
times from the RG-improved field theory. The results obtained for the diffusive
case are relevant for Mg$^{2+}$ or Cd$^{2+}$ doping in the TMMC crystal's
exciton coalescence process and also imply a surprising result for the dynamic
magnetization in the critical one-dimensional Ising model with a fixed spin.
For the case of ballistic reactants, a model is introduced and solved exactly
in one dimension. The density-deficit profile is obtained, as is the density of
left and right moving reactants near the impenetrable boundary.
