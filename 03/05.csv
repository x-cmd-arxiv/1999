  LaTeX). To appear in J Phys Chem",,,,"adap-org nlin.AO q-bio.MN q-bio.PE",,"  The aims of this paper are to propose, construct and analyse microscopic
kinetic models for the emergence of long chains of RNA from monomeric
beta-D-ribonucleotide precursors in prebiotic circumstances. Our theory starts
out from similar but more general chemical assumptions to those of Eigen,
namely that catalytic replication can lead to a large population of long
chains. In particular, our models incorporate the possibility of (i) direct
chain growth, (ii) template-assisted synthesis and (iii) catalysis by RNA
replicase ribozymes, all with varying degrees of efficiency. However, in our
models the reaction mechanisms are kept `open'; we do not assume the existence
of closed hypercycles which sustain a population of long chains. Rather it is
the feasibility of the initial emergence of a self-sustaining set of RNA chains
from monomeric nucleotides which is our prime concern. We confront directly the
central nonlinear features of the problem, which have often been overlooked in
previous studies. Our detailed microscopic kinetic models lead to kinetic
equations which are generalisations of the Becker-Doring system (BD) for the
step-wise growth of clusters or polymer chains; they lie within a general
theoretical framework which has recently been successfully applied to a wide
range of complex chemical problems. In fact, the most accurate model we
consider has BD aggregation terms, together with a general Smoluchowski
fragmentation term to model the competing hydrolysis of RNA polymer chains. We
conclude that, starting from reasonable initial conditions of monomeric
nucleotide concentrations within a prebiotic soup and in an acceptable
timescale, it is possible for a self-replicating subset of polyribonucleotide
chains to be selected, while less efficient replicators become extinct.

(including those with a formally negative flux) our definition is well behaved,
tending to a definite value with finite errors as the flux goes to zero.
  This new definition is especially useful when considering the colors of faint
objects, as the difference of two `asinh' magnitudes measures the usual flux
ratio for bright objects, while avoiding the problems caused by dividing two
very uncertain values for faint objects.

agreement with earlier Ginga results, the average spectrum can be represented
in terms of a simple spectral model consisting of a very hard power-law
continuum ($\Gamma \approx 1.1$) modified below $\sim 6$ keV by a high
absorbing column ($N_H\sim 6\times 10^{23}$ \cunits) together with a high
equivalent width Fe-K emission feature at 6.4 keV. The abnormally flat spectral
index is probably the signature of a strong reflection component and we
consider two models incorporating such emission. In the first the reflected
signal suffers the same absorption as the intrinsic continuum, whereas in the
second the reflection is treated as an unabsorbed spectral component. In the
former case, we require a very strong reflection signal ($R ~< 3$) in order to
match the data; in addition variability of both the intrinsic power-law and the
reflection component is required. The unabsorbed reflection model requires a
somewhat higher line-of-sight column density to the nuclear source ($\sim
10^{24}$ \cunits), but in this case the reflected signal remains constant
whilst the level of the intrinsic continuum varies. The latter description is
consistent with the reflection originating from the illuminated far inner wall
of a molecular torus, the nearside of which screens our direct view of the
central continuum source.

Observatory 10 m atmospheric Cherenkov imaging telescope. In 1995, with the
exception of a single night, the flux from Markarian 501 was constant on daily
and monthly time-scales and had an average flux of only 10% that of the Crab
Nebula, making it the weakest VHE source detected to date. In 1996, the average
flux was approximately twice the 1995 flux and showed significant
month-to-month variability. No significant day-scale variations were detected.
The average gamma-ray flux above ~350 GeV in the 1997 observing season rose to
1.4 times that of the Crab Nebula -- 14 times the 1995 discovery level --
allowing a search for variability on time-scales shorter than one day.
Significant hour-scale variability was present in the 1997 data, with the
shortest, observed on MJD 50607, having a doubling time of ~2 hours. In 1998
the average emission level decreased considerably from that of 1997 (to ~20% of
the Crab Nebula flux) but two significant flaring events were observed. Thus,
the emission from Markarian 501 shows large amplitude and rapid flux
variability at very high energies as does Markarian 421. It also shows large
mean flux level variations on year-to-year time-scales, behaviour which has not
been seen from Markarian 421 so far.

only a local null infinity. There is a non-vanishing news function due to the
existence of the string even though there is no radiation.
  We prove that if null infinity has a smooth compact cross section and the
spacetime is not flat in a neighbourhood of null infinity, then the
translational Killing vector must be timelike and the spacetime is stationary.
The other case in which an additional symmetry of axisymmetric spacetimes
admits compact cross sections of null infinity is the boost symmetry, which
leads to radiative spacetimes representing ``uniformly accelerated objects''.
These cases were analyzed in detail in our previous works. If the translational
Killing vector is spacelike or null, corresponding to cylindrical or plane
waves, some complete generators of null infinity are ``singular'' but null
infinity itself can be smooth apart from these generators.
  As two explicit examples of local null infinity, Schwarzschild spacetime with
a string and a class of cylindrical waves with a string are discussed in detail
in the Appendix.

MeV into accessible Standard Model states. This narrow width means that the
usual branching fractions for such a light Higgs boson are highly susceptible
to any new particles to which it has unsuppressed couplings. In particular,
there are many reasonable and interesting theoretical ideas that naturally
imply an invisibly-decaying Higgs boson. The motivations include models with
light supersymmetric neutralinos, spontaneously broken lepton number,
radiatively generated neutrino masses, additional singlet scalar(s), or
right-handed neutrinos in the extra dimensions of TeV gravity. We discuss these
approaches to model building and their implications for Higgs boson
phenomenology in future Tevatron runs. We find, for example, that the Tevatron
with 30 fb^{-1} integrated luminosity can make a 3\sigma observation in the l+
l- plus missing transverse energy channel for a 125 GeV Higgs boson that is
produced with the same strength as the Standard Model Higgs boson but always
decays invisibly. We also analyze the b anti-b plus missing transverse energy
final state signal and conclude that it is not as sensitive, but it may assist
in excluding the possibility of an invisibly-decaying Higgs boson or enable
confirmation of an observed signal in the dilepton channel. We argue that a
comprehensive Higgs search at the Tevatron should include the possibility that
the Higgs boson decays invisibly.

in the LLA. We calculate the DGLAP-type evolution kernels in the LLA and solve
the skewed GLAP evolution equations with a modified version of the
CTEQ-package. In the third chapter, we discuss the algorithms used in the LO
evolution program for skewed parton distributions in the DGLAP region, discuss
the stability of the code and reproduce the LO diagonal evolution within less
than 0.5% of the original CTEQ-code. In chapter 4, we show that factorization
holds for the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude in QCD, up to power
suppressed terms, to all orders in perturbation theory. In chapter 5, we
demonstrate that perturbative QCD allows one to calculate the absolute cross
section of diffractive, exclusive production of photons (DVCS) at large $Q^2$
at HERA, while the aligned jet model allows one to estimate the cross section
for intermediate $Q^2 \sim 2 GeV^2$. We find a significant DVCS counting rate
for the current generation of experiments at HERA and a large azimuthal angle
asymmetry for HERA kinematics. In the last chapter, we propose a new
methodology of gaining shape fits to skewed parton distributions and, for the
first time, to determine the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the DIS
amplitude. We do this by using several recent fits to $F_2(x,Q^2)$ to compute
the asymmetry $A$ for the combined DVCS and Bethe-Heitler cross section. In the
appendix, we give an application of distributional methods as discussed
abstractly in chapter 4.

(target-space) two-dimensional string cosmology. A numerical analysis indicates
that the identification of time with the Liouville mode results in an expanding
universe with matter which exhibits an inflationary phase, and `graceful exit'
from it, tending asymptotically to a flat-metric fixed point.This fixed point
is characterized by a dilaton configuration which, depending on the initial
conditions, either decreases linearly with the cosmic time, or is a finite
constant. This implies that, in contrast to the critical string case, the
string coupling remains bounded during the exit from the inflationary phase,
and, thus, the pertinent dynamics can be reliably described in terms of a
tree-level string effective action. The r\^ole of matter in inducing such
phenomena is emphasized. It is also interesting to note that the asymptotic
value of the vacuum energy, which in the $\sigma$-model framework is identified
with the `running' central charge deficit, depends crucially on the set of
initial conditions. Thus, although preliminary, this toy model seems to share
all the features expected to characterize a phenomenologically acceptable
cosmological string model.

orthogonal, and the evolution does not correspond to a semigroup (experiments
on the decay of the neutral $K$-meson system strongly support the semigroup
evolution postulated by Lee, Oehme and Yang, and Yang and Wu). The scattering
theory of Lax and Phillips, originally developed for classical wave equations,
has been recently extended to the description of the evolution of resonant

unstable system is that of a semigroup, and the resonant state is a
well-defined function in the Lax-Phillips Hilbert space. In this paper we apply
this theory to a relativistically covariant quantum field theoretical form of
the (soluble) Lee model. We construct the translation representations with the
help of the wave operators, and show that the resulting Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix
is an inner function (the Lax-Phillips theory is essentially a theory of
translation invariant subspaces). In the special case that the $S$-matrix is a
rational inner function, we obtain the resonant state explicitly and analyze

general case differs only by a so-called trivial inner factor, which does not

Hamiltonian dynamical systems. In this paper we study excitation thresholds for
(nonlinearly dynamically stable) ground state breather or standing wave
solutions for networks of coupled nonlinear oscillators and wave equations of
nonlinear Schr\""odinger (NLS) type. Excitation thresholds are rigorously
characterized by variational methods. The excitation threshold is related to
the optimal (best) constant in a class of discr ete interpolation inequalities
related to the Hamiltonian energy. We establish a precise connection among $d$,
the dimensionality of the lattice, $2\sigma+1$, the degree of the nonlinearity
and the existence of an excitation threshold for discrete nonlinear
Schr\""odinger systems (DNLS).
  We prove that if $\sigma\ge 2/d$, then ground state standing waves exist if
and only if the total power is larger than some strictly positive threshold,
$\nu_{thresh}(\sigma, d)$. This proves a conjecture of Flach, Kaldko& MacKay in
the context of DNLS. We also discuss upper and lower bounds for excitation
thresholds for ground states of coupled systems of NLS equations, which arise
in the modeling of pulse propagation in coupled arrays of optical fibers.

system of identical bosons and fermions is a fermion if it contains an odd
number of fermions and is a boson otherwise. Here we generalize this result to
composite systems of identical quons. We find
$q_{composite}=q_{constituent}^{n^2}$ for a system of $n$ identical quons. This
result reduces to the earlier result for bosons and fermions. Using this

equilibrium state rho which is almost completely mixed. One interpretation of
this state is that it represents an ensemble average, and that an individual
atom is at any time in one of the eigenstates of $\rho$. The theory of Teich
and Mahler [Phys. Rev. A 45, 3300 (1992)] makes this interpretation concrete,
with an individual atom jumping stochastically between the two eigenstates when
a photon is emitted. The dressed atom theory is also supposed to describe the
quantum jumps of an individual atom due to photo-emissions. But the two
pictures are contradictory because the dressed states of the atom are almost
orthogonal to the eigenstates of $\rho$. In this paper we investigate three
ways of measuring the field radiated by the atom, which attempt to reproduce
the simple quantum jump dynamics of the dressed state or Teich and Mahler
models. These are: spectral detection (using optical filters), two-state jumps
(using adaptive homodyne detection) and orthogonal jumps (another adaptive
homodyne scheme). We find that the three schemes closely mimic the jumps of the
dressed state model, with errors of order $(3/4) (\gamma/\Omega)^{2/3}$, $(1/4)
(\gamma/\Omega)^{2}$, and $(3/4) (\gamma/\Omega)^{2}$ respectively. The
significance of this result to the program of environmentally-induced
superselection is discussed.

solve the particle dynamics of the two-pulson interaction analytically as a
canonical Hamiltonian system for geodesic motion with two degrees of freedom
