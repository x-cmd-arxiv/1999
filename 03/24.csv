inconsistent with spherical (isotropic) blast-wave models. In particular, GRB
980519 had the most rapidly fading of the well-documented GRB afterglows, with
t^{-2.05\pm 0.04} in optical as well as in X-rays. We show that such temporal
decay is more consistent with the evolution of a jet after it slows down and
spreads laterally, for which t^{-p} decay is expected (where p is the index of
the electron energy distribution). Such a beaming model would relax the energy
requirements on some of the more extreme GRBs by a factor of several hundreds.
It is likely that a large fraction of the weak (or no) afterglow observations
are also due to the common occurrence of beaming in GRBs, and that their jets
have already transitioned to the spreading phase before the first afterglow
observations were made. With this interpretation, a universal value of p~2.5 is
consistent with all data.

interstellar medium sometimes produces multiple imaging of pulsars which can
lead to periodic oscillations of intensity in pulsar dynamic spectra records.
Such events can be used as tools to resolve the emission regions in pulsar
magnetospheres. Here we describe results from the recent observation of a
double imaging event for PSR B1133+16, which place fairly tight constraints on
the location of the emission regions. Our analysis constrains the location of
the scattering object to the shell of the Local Bubble. The phase of the
oscillations shows significant variations across the pulse. The minimum value
for the transverse separation of the emitting regions at the two edges of the
pulse is inferred to be 3 x 10^5 m. This translates to a minimum emission
altitude of 2.6 x 10^6 m. The non-monotonic variations of the fringe phase with
pulse longitude are interpreted as variations of the altitude of the emission
regions for the orthogonal polarization modes of this pulsar. This is in
agreement with theories where propagation effects, such as refraction, are
responsible for the orthogonal modes.

It is shown that spectrum area corresponding to these data is sensitive enough
to such MDM model parameters as neutrino mass $m_{\nu}$, number species of
massive neutrino $N_{\nu}$, baryon content $\Omega_b$ and Hubble constant
$h\equiv H_0/100km/s/Mpc$. The $\chi^2$ minimization method was used for their
determination. If all these parameters are under searching then observable data
on the Abell-ACO power spectrum and mass function prefer models which have
parameters in the range $\Omega_{\nu}$ ($\sim 0.4-0.5$), low $\Omega_b$ ($\le
0.01$) and $h$ ($\sim 0.4-0.6$). The best-fit parameters are as follows:
$N_{\nu}=3$, $m_{\nu}=4.4eV$, $h=0.56$, $\Omega_b\le 0.01$. The

spectrum, mass loss due to stellar evolution, and the tidal field of the parent

the results of N-body calculations and isotropic FP calculations. The main
reason for the discrepancy is an oversimplified treatment of the tidal field
employed in the isotropic FP models. In this paper we perform a series of
calculations with anisotropic FP models with a better treatment of the tidal
boundary and compare these with N-body calculations. The new tidal boundary
condition in our FP model includes one free parameter. We find that a single
value of this parameter gives satisfactory agreement between the N-body and FP
models over a wide range of initial conditions.
  Using the improved FP model, we carry out an extensive survey of the
evolution of globular clusters over a wide range of initial conditions varying
the slope of the mass function, the central concentration, and the relaxation
time. The evolution of clusters is followed up to the moment of core collapse
or the disruption of the clusters in the tidal field of the parent galaxy. In
general, our model clusters, calculated with the anisotropic FP model with the
improved treatment for the tidal boundary, live longer than isotropic models.
The difference in the lifetime between the isotropic and anisotropic models is
particularly large when the effect of mass loss via stellar evolution is rather
significant. On the other hand the difference is small for relaxation-
dominated clusters which initially have steep mass functions and high central
concentrations.

combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility,
allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show
how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This
allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better
understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno
and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on
several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial
intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal
change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including
revision and update.

of gauge in generally covariant models has a twofold pupose: not only to render
the dynamics unique, but also to define the spacetime points. A geometric way
of choosing gauge that is not based on coordinate conditions---the so-called
covariant gauge fixing---is described. After a covariant gauge fixing, the
dynamics is unique and the background manifold points are well-defined, but the
description remains invariant with respect to all diffeomorphisms of the
background manifold. Transformations between different covariant gauge fixings
form the well-known Bergmann-Komar group. Each covariant gauge fixing
determines a so-called Kucha\v{r} decomposition. The construction of the
quantum theory is based on the Kucha\v{r} form of the action and the Dirac
method of operator constraints. It is demonstrated that the Bergmann-Komar
group is too large to be implementable by unitary maps in the quantum domain.

within the framework of generalized factorization in which the effective Wilson
coefficients $c^{eff}_i$ are renormalization-scale and -scheme independent
while factorization is applied to the tree-level hadronic matrix elements.
Contrary to previous studies, our $c_i^{eff}$ do not suffer from gauge and
infrared problems. Nonfactorizable effects are parametrized in terms of N_c(LL)
and N_c(LR), the effective numbers of colors arising from (V-A)(V-A) and
(V-A)(V+A) four-quark operators, respectively. Tree and penguin transitions are
classified into six different classes. The data of $B^-\to\rho^0\pi^-$ and
$B^-\to\phi K^-$ clearly indicate that $N_c(LR)\neq N_c(LL)$: The first
measurement of the b -> u mode $B^-\to\rho^0\pi^-$ and the experimental
information on the tree-dominated mode $B^-\to\omega\pi^-$ all imply that
Nc(LL) is less than 3, whereas the CLEO measurement of $B^-\to\phi K^-$ shows
Nc(LR)>3. For given input parameters, the prediction of ${\cal B}(B\to\eta' K)$
is largely improved by setting Nc(LL)~2 and Nc(LR)>Nc(LL); in particular, the
charm content of the eta' contributes in the right direction. The decay rate of
$B\to\phi K^*$ is very sensitive to the form-factor ratio A_2/A_1; the absence
of $B\to\phi K$ events does not necessarily invalidate the factorization
approach. If the branching ratio of $B^-\to\omega K^-$ is experimentally found
to be significantly larger than that of $B^-\to\rho^0 K^-$, we argue that
inelastic final-state rescattering may account for the disparity between
$\omega K^-$ and $\rho^0 K^-$.

time-reversal non-invariance in the neutral kaon system, we make a comparative
discussion of the CPLEAR and KTeV measurements. The most suitable way to
consistently incorporate the mixing, the time evolution and the decays of
kaons, is to describe the neutral kaon system as a system with a non-Hermitean
Hamiltonian. In this framework, the physical (decaying) incoming and outgoing
states are distinct and belong to dual spaces. Moreover, since they are
eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian, they never oscillate. This is directly
manifest in the orthogonality conditions of the physical states, which entirely
determine the evolution of the kaon system. Along these lines we conclude:
CPLEAR studies K0-bar{K0} oscillations, a process where initial and final
states can be reversed, the CPLEAR asymmetry being an effect directly related
to the definition of time-reversal. Conclusively, CPLEAR provides a direct
measurement of T-violation without any assumption either on unitarity or on
CPT-invariance. The KTeV experiment studies in particular the process KL -> pi+
pi- e+ e- where they measure a T-odd effect. However, using unitarity together
with estimates of the final state interactions, it should be possible to
determine whether this effect can be identified with a genuine T-reversal
violation.

\Delta m^2 in the MSW range does lead to suppression of the electron neutrinos
reaching the earth from the sun by P_S=1/2, the situation is different for
neutrinos that have passed through the earth. We make the pedagogical point
that, just as with smaller mixing angles, the earth regenerates the |\nu_1>
state from the predominantly |\nu_2 > state reaching the earth, leading to
coherent interference effects. This regeneration can lead to a day-night effect
and an energy dependence of the suppression of solar electron neutrinos, even
for the case of maximal mixing. For large mixing angles, the energy dependence
of the day-night asymmetry depends heavily on Delta m^2. With a sufficiently
sensitive measurement of the day-night effect, this energy dependence could be
used to distinguish among the large mixing angle solutions of the solar
neutrino problem.

C.D.Aliprantis and O.Burkinshaw, Multiplication and compact-friendly operators,
Positivity 1 (1997), 171--180], we prove that a positive multiplication

if and only if the multiplier is constant on a set of positive measure (resp.
on a non-empty open set).
  In the process of establishing this result, we also prove that any
multiplication operator has a family of hyperinvariant bands -- a fact that
does not seem to have appeared in the literature before. This provides useful
information about the commutant of a multiplication operator.

concept of combinatorial torsion which we called absolute torsion. Compared
with the classical Reidemeister torsion it has the advantage of having a
well-defined sign. Also, the absolute torsion is defined for arbitrary
orientable flat vector bundles, and not only for unimodular ones, as is
classical Reidemeister torsion.
  In this paper I show that the sign behavior of the absolute torsion, under a
continuous deformation of the flat bundle, is determined by the eta-invariant
and the Pontrjagin classes.

Let $X/K$ be a proper smooth curve and let $A/K$ denote its jacobian. Let $P$
and $Q$ belong to $X(K)$. The divisor $P - Q$ defines a $K$-rational point of
$A/K$. In this article, we study the reduction of $P - Q$ in the N\'eron model
${\cal A}_K/{\cal O}_K$ of $A/K$ in terms of the reductions of the points $P$
and $Q$ in a regular model $\cx/\co_K$ of $X/K$.
  The author introduced earlier two functorial filtrations of the prime-to-$p$
part of the group of component $\Phi_K$ of ${\cal A}_K/{\cal O}_K$. Filtrations
for the full group $\Phi_K$ were later introduced by Bosch and Xarles. Given
two points $P$ and $Q$ in $X(K)$, it is natural to wonder whether it is
possible to predict when the reduction of $P-Q$ in $\Phi_K$ belongs to one of
these functorial subgroups. We give in this paper a sufficient condition on the
special fiber of a model $\cx$ for the image of $P-Q$ in $\Phi_K$ to belong to
the subgroup $\Psi_{K,L}$. When this condition is satisfied, we are able to
provide a formula for the order of this image. We conjecture that the
sufficient condition alluded to above is also necessary and we provide evidence
in support of this conjecture. We also discuss cases where the image of $P-Q$
belongs to a functorial subgroup of $\Psi_{K,L}$, using a pairing associated to
$\Phi_K$.

excellent description for all essential partial waves has been found in the
energy range 0 -- 350 MeV. The one-channel version of the model includes the
orthogonality condition to most symmetric six-quark states in all lowest
partial waves and thus, from this point of view, the model generalizes the well
known Saito's orthogonality condition model (OCM) for the baryon-baryon
interaction case. The specific features of the presented model which
distinguish it from many conventional force models are discussed in details.
One of them is a specific tensor mixing between nodal and nodeless
wavefunctions which results in very reasonable values of the OPE cut-off
parameter \Lambda =0.78 GeV and the \pi NN-coupling constant value f^2=0.075 in
nice agreement with modern trends. The model, in case of its confirmation in
precise few-nucleon calculations, can lead to noticeable revisions for many
nuclear properties given by conventional force models.
