technique is not limited to detection of so called ``pixel lensing'' events,
but can also be used to improve photometry for classical microlensing events by
removing the effects of blending. We will present a method whereby DIA can be
used to reveal the true unblended colours, positions and light curves of
microlensing events. We discuss the need for a technique to obtain the accurate
microlensing time scales from blended sources, and present a possible solution
to this problem using the existing HST colour magnitude diagrams of the
galactic bulge and LMC. The use of such a solution with both classical and
pixel microlensing searches is discussed. We show that one of the major causes
of systematic noise in DIA is differential refraction. A technique for removing
this systematic by effectively registering images to a common airmass is
presented. Improvements to commonly used image differencing techniques are
discussed.

near the centre of the S0 galaxy NGC4036. Dynamical models based on the Jeans
Equation have been constructed from the stellar data to determine the
gravitational potential in which the ionized gas is expected to orbit. Inside
10'', the observed gas rotation curve falls well short of the predicted
circular velocity. Over a comparable radial region the observed gas velocity
dispersion is far higher than the one expected from thermal motions or small
scale turbulence, corroborating that the gas cannot be following the
streamlines of nearly closed orbits. We explore several avenues to understand
the dynamical state of the gas: (1) We treat the gas as a collisionless
ensemble of cloudlets and apply the Jeans Equation to it; this modeling shows
that inside 4'' the gas velocity dispersion is just high enough to explain
quantitatively the absence of rotation. (2) Alternatively, we explore whether
the gas may arise from the `just shed' mass-loss envelopes of the bulge stars,
in which case their kinematics should simply mimic that of the stars. he latter
approach matches the data better than (1), but still fails to explain the low
velocity dispersion and slow rotation velocity of the gas for 5''<r<10''. (3)
Finally, we explore, whether drag forces on the ionized gas may aid in
explaining its peculiar kinematics. While all these approaches provide a much
better description of the data than cold gas on closed orbits, we do not yet
have a definitive model to describe the observed gas kinematics at all radii.

a mass range from 0.1 down to 0.02 Msun, well within the substellar regime.
Follow-up low-resolution optical spectroscopy (635-920 nm) for eight of our
candidates (I=16-19.5) shows that they have spectral types M6-M8.5 which are
consistent with the expectations for true members. Compared with their Pleiades
counterparts of similar types, Halpha emission is generally stronger, while NaI
and KI absorption lines appear weaker, as expected for lower surface gravities
and younger ages. Additionally, TiO bands and in particular VO bands appear
clearly enhanced in our candidate with the latest spectral type, SOri 45 (M8.5,
I=19.5), compared to objects of similar types in older clusters and the field.
We have estimated the mass of this candidate at only 0.020-0.040 Msun, hence it
is one of the least massive brown dwarfs yet discovered. We also discuss in
this paper the potential role of deuterium as a tracer of both substellar

Spectrum (GPS) radio sources drawn from the Westerbork Northern Sky Survey
(WENSS). Redshifts have been determined for 19 (40%) of the objects. The
optical spectra of the GPS sources identified with low redshift galaxies show
deep stellar absorption features. This confirms previous suggestions that their
optical light is not significantly contaminated by AGN-related emission, but is
dominated by a population of old (>9 Gyr) and metal-rich (>0.2 [Fe/H]) stars,
justifying the use of these (probably) young radio sources as probes of galaxy
evolution. The optical spectra of GPS sources identified with quasars are
indistinguishable from those of flat spectrum quasars, and clearly different
from the spectra of Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) quasars. The redshift
distribution of the GPS quasars in our radio-faint sample is comparable to that
of the bright samples presented in the literature, peaking at z ~ 2-3. It is
unlikely that a significant population of low redshift GPS quasars is missed
due to selection effects in our sample. We therefore claim that there is a
genuine difference between the redshift distributions of GPS galaxies and
quasars, which, because it is present in both the radio-faint and bright
samples, can not be due to a redshift-luminosity degeneracy. It is therefore
unlikely that the GPS quasars and galaxies are unified by orientation, unless
the quasar opening angle is a strong function of redshift. We suggest that the
GPS quasars and galaxies are unrelated populations and just happen to have
identical observed radio-spectral properties, and hypothesise that GPS quasars
are a sub-class of flat spectrum quasars.

dwarf companion in a half-year orbit. Anomalously large variations in the
pulsar's apparent spin-down rate have suggested the presence of a second
companion in a much wider orbit. Using timing observations made on more than
seven hundred days spanning eleven years, we confirm this anomalous timing
behavior. We explicitly demonstrate, for the first time, that a timing model
consisting of the sum of two non-interacting Keplerian orbits can account for
the observed signal. Both circular and elliptical orbits are allowed, although
highly eccentric orbits require improbable orbital geometries.
  The motion of the pulsar in the inner orbit is very nearly a Keplerian
ellipse, but the tidal effects of the outer companion cause variations in the
orbital elements. We have measured the change in the projected semi-major axis
of the orbit, which is dominated by precession-driven changes in the orbital
inclination. This measurement, along with limits on the rate of change of other
orbital elements, can be used to significantly restrict the properties of the
outer orbit. We find that the second companion most likely has a mass m~0.01
Msun --- it is almost certainly below the hydrogen burning limit (m<0.036 Msun,
95% confidence) --- and has a current distance from the binary of ~35 AU and
orbital period of order one hundred years. Circular (and near-circular) orbits
are allowed only if the pulsar magnetic field is ~3x10^9 G, an order of
magnitude higher than a typical millisecond pulsar field strength. In this
case, the companion has mass m~1.2x10^-3 Msun and orbital period ~62 years.

studied in an elastically isotropic Ising system above the critical point on

effect of spin-lattice relaxation on the ultrasonic attenuation is
investigated. The crossover between weak-singularity behavior $t^{-2 \alpha}$

high-frequency regime with singularity of the type $t^{-z \nu +\alpha}$ is

solar-system tests (weak-field regime), binary-pulsar tests (strong-field

(strong-field effects detected in our weak-gravitational-field conditions).
This is done within the most natural class of alternative theories to general
relativity, namely tensor-scalar theories, in which the gravitational
interaction is mediated by one tensor field (g_munu) together with one or
several scalar fields (phi). Our main conclusion is that strong-field tests are
qualitatively different from weak-field experiments: They constrain theories
which are strictly indistinguishable from general relativity in the solar
system. We also show that binary-pulsar data are so precise that they already
rule out the theories for which scalar effects could have been detected with
LIGO or VIRGO. This proves that it is therefore sufficient to compute the
`chirp' templates within general relativity.

hemisphere opposite to a hemisphere containing two tagged quark jets. Gluon
jets defined in this manner are equivalent to gluon jets produced from a color
singlet point source and thus correspond to the definition employed for most
theoretical calculations. In a separate stage of the analysis, we select quark
jets in a manner to correspond to calculations, as the particles in hemispheres
of flavor tagged light quark (uds) events. We present the distributions of
rapidity, scaled energy, the logarithm of the momentum, and transverse momentum
with respect to the jet axes, for charged particles in these gluon and quark
jets. We also examine the charged particle multiplicity distributions of the
jets in restricted intervals of rapidity. For soft particles at large
transverse momentum, we observe the charged particle multiplicity ratio of
gluon to quark jets to be 2.29 +- 0.09 +- 0.15 in agreement with the prediction
that this ratio should approximately equal the ratio of QCD color factors,
CA/CF = 2.25. The intervals used to define soft particles and large transverse
momentum for this result, p<4 GeV/c and 0.8<p_t<3.0 GeV/c, are motivated by the
predictions of the Herwig Monte Carlo multihadronic event generator.
Additionally, our gluon jet data allow a sensitive test of the phenomenon of
non-leading QCD terms known as color reconnection. We test the model of color
reconnection implemented in the Ariadne Monte Carlo multihadronic event
generator and find it to be disfavored by our data.

photoabsorption cross sections. These unretarded results are considerably
reduced by including retardation effects in an approximate way since the
average momentum transfer (together with the mean excitation energy) turns out
to be larger than usually assumed. Transverse and seagull contributions are
estimated in a simple harmonic oscillator quark model and found to be

changing the sign of the single-particle energies of positive-energy

meson fields are evaluated by means of the derivative expansion up to the

the meaning of ``measurement'' to include all property-indicating facts.
Intrinsically space is undifferentiated: there are no points on which a world
of locally instantiated physical properties could be built. Instead, reality is
built on facts, in the sense that the properties of things are extrinsic, or
supervenient on property-indicating facts. The actual extent to which the world
is spatially and temporally differentiated (that is, the extent to which
spatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by the facts) is
necessarily limited. Notwithstanding that the state vector does nothing but
assign probabilities, quantum mechanics affords a complete understanding of the
actual world. If there is anything that is incomplete, it is the actual world,
but its incompleteness exists only in relation to a conceptual framework that
is more detailed than the actual world. Two deep-seated misconceptions are
responsible for the interpretational difficulties associated with quantum
mechanics: the notion that the spatial and temporal aspects of the world are
adequately represented by sets with the cardinality of the real numbers, and
the notion of an instantaneous state that evolves in time. The latter is an
unwarranted (in fact, incoherent) projection of our apparent ``motion in time''
into the world of physics. Equally unwarranted, at bottom, is the use of causal
concepts. There nevertheless exists a ``classical'' domain in which language
suggestive of nomological necessity may be used. Quantum mechanics not only is
strictly consistent with the existence of this domain but also presupposes it
in several ways.

solution. We can also check an integrability of a given equation by a
perturbation growth of a solution, namely Lyapunov exponent. Therefore,
singularity confinement test and Lyapunov exponent are related each other in
ultradiscrete equations and we propose an integrability test from this point of
view.
