structure of the optically thin outer layers is in first approximation
independent from radiative transfer effects. We then calculate this thermal
structure using the detailed photoionisation code MAPPINGS, including the
effects of an external radiation field from the centre of the accretion flow.
We apply our method to cataclysmic variable (CV), and stellar mass black hole
discs. We find that in the case of CV's, the mass evaporation rate from the
disc due to the thermal instability is not likely to be significant compared to
the mass flow through the disc. In the case of black hole discs, the very

out the edge and produces a steep rise in polarization at lambda < 912 A. In
the second model, the scattering occurs in a hot coronal plasma outflowing from

equal distances occur more often than by chance. We present an idealised
version of this method as well as numerical simulations, we discuss the
statistical relevance of the expected signature and we show how the extraction
of a topological signal may also lead to a precise determination of the
cosmological parameters. A more realistic version of the method which takes
account of uncertainties in the position and velocity data is then discussed.
We apply our technique to presently available data, namely a quasar catalog,

been able to observe the actual particle energy distributions, e.g. solar
system plasmas, and in many particle acceleration theories, the heating
mechanism supplies only some fraction of the available energy to very energetic
particles. The remainder goes into producing lower energy particles which
settle into a quasi-Maxwellian energy distribution. Here, I review the
arguments for ``thermal'' versus ``non-thermal'' plasmas in accreting black
hole systems and discuss the physics and emission properties of ``hybrid''

fluctuations in these spectra on timescales close to the shortest ones likely
in these objects. We point out that this represents a unique opportunity. Using
these and future detectors in combination with broadband X-ray satellites like
SAX and RXTE, we will be able to simultaneously follow all significant
X-ray/gamma-ray variations in a blazar's emission. This will provide the most
stringent test yet of the synchrotron-Compton emission model for these objects.
In preparation for the data to come, we present sample SSC model calculations
using a fully self-consistent, accurate code to illustrate the variability
behavior one might see (the range of behavior is wider than many expect) and to
show how good timing information can probe physical conditions in the source.
If the model works, i.e., if X-ray/TeV variations are consistent with being
produced by a common electron distribution, then we show it is possible to
robustly estimate the blazar's intrinsic TeV spectrum from its X-ray spectrum.
Knowing this spectrum, we can then determine the level of absorption in the
observed spectrum. Constraining this absorption, due to gamma-ray pair
production on diffuse radiation, provides an important constraint on the
infrared extragalactic background intensity. Without the intrinsic spectrum, we
show that detecting absorption is very difficult and argue that Mrk 421 and
501, as close as they are, may already be absorbed by a factor 2 at
approximately 3 TeV. This should not be ignored when fitting emission models to

same electrons are responsible for both the X-ray and the gamma-ray emission of
these objects. In this case, we show that we can use their observed X-ray
spectra to robustly estimate their intrinsic gamma-ray spectra. Among blazars,
Mrk 421/501 are particularly well-suited for this task because the Compton
scattering which produces their TeV gamma-rays is likely to be in the
Klein-Nishina limit, where the outgoing photon has an energy insensitive to the
incoming photon energy. With a better handle on their intrinsic TeV spectra, we
can then begin to search for evidence of absorption due to gamma-ray pair
production on diffuse infrared background radiation. We discuss some of the
pitfalls that arise when one attempts to do this without knowing the intrinsic
spectrum. Although Mrk 421/501 are very nearby, the emission of these sources
extends to sufficiently high energies (> 20 TeV in Mrk 501) that we may
nevertheless be able to derive interesting constraints on the infrared
background. If correct, the combination of the COBE 140 micron detection and
the measurement of Mrk 501's spectrum out to 20 TeV and perhaps beyond rules
out conventional galaxy evolution and star formation scenarios, implying that
much of the star formation in the Universe indeed occurs at early times in
highly obscured sources that have been missed until now.

0.003 times the virial radius, allowing an accurate comparison with rotation
curve data. A good fit to both galactic and cluster sized halos can be achieved
using the density profile rho(r) \propto [(r/r_s)^1.5(1+(r/r_s)^1.5)]^-1, where
r_s is a scale radius. This profile has a steeper asymptotic slope, rho(r)
\propto r^-1.5, and a sharper turnover than found by lower resolution studies.
The central structure of relaxed halos that form within a hierarchical universe
has a remarkably small scatter (unrelaxed halos would not host disks). We
compare the results with a sample of dark matter dominated, low surface
brightness (LSB) galaxies with circular velocities in the range 100-300 km/s.
The rotation curves of disks within cold dark matter halos rise too steeply to
match these data which require a constant mass density in the central regions.
The same conclusion is reached if we compare the scale free shape of observed
rotation curves with the simulation data. It is important to confirm these
results using stellar rather than HI rotation curves for LSB galaxies. We test
the effects of introducing a cut-off in the power spectrum that may occur in a
universe dominated by warm dark matter. In this case halos form by a monolithic
collapse but the final density profile hardly changes, demonstrating that the
merger history does not play a role in determining the halo structure.

time because: first, nonlinear peaks become less rare events; second, the
densest regions stop forming new galaxies because gas there becomes too hot to
cool and collapse; third, after galaxies form, they are gravitationally
``debiased'' because their velocity field is the same as the dark matter. To
show these effects, we perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation and
examine the density field of recently formed galaxies as a function of
redshift. We find the bias b_* of recently formed galaxies (the ratio of the
rms fluctuations of these galaxies and mass), evolves from 4.5 at z=3 to around
1 at z=0, on 8 h^{-1} Mpc comoving scales. The correlation coefficient r_*
between recently formed galaxies and mass evolves from 0.9 at z=3 to 0.25 at
z=0. As gas in the universe heats up and prevents star formation, star-forming
galaxies become poorer tracers of the mass density field. After galaxies form,
the linear continuity equation is a good approximation to the gravitational
debiasing, even on nonlinear scales. The most interesting observational
consequence of the simulations is that the linear regression of the
star-formation density field on the galaxy density field evolves from about 0.9
at z=1 to 0.35 at z=0. These effects also provide a possible explanation for
the Butcher-Oemler effect, the excess of blue galaxies in clusters at redshift

investigate the evolution of a self-gravitating multi-phase interstellar medium
in the central kiloparsec region of a galactic disk. We find that a
gravitationally and thermally unstable disk evolves, in a self-stabilizing
manner, into a globally quasi-stable disk that consists of cold (T < 100 K),
dense clumps and filaments surrounded by hot (T > 10^4 K), diffuse medium. The
quasi-stationary, filamentary structure of the cold gas is remarkable. The hot
gas, characterized by low-density holes and voids, is produced by shock
heating. The shocks derive their energy from differential rotation and
gravitational perturbations due to the formation of cold dense clumps. In the
quasi-stable phase where cold and dense clouds are formed, the effective
stability parameter, Q, has a value in the range 2-5. The dynamic range of our
multi-phase calculations is 10^6 - 10^7 in both density and temperature. Phase
diagrams for this turbulent medium are analyzed and discussed.

Maximization (MREM), for the reconstruction of gamma-ray intensity maps from
COMPTEL data. The algorithm is based on the iterative Richardson-Lucy scheme to
which we added a wavelet thresholding step in order to eliminate image-noise in
the reconstruction. The wavelet thresholding explicitly accounts for spatial
correlations in the data, and adapts the angular resolution locally, depending
on the significance of the signal in the data.
  We compare the performance of MREM to that of the maximum entropy and the
Richardson-Lucy algorithms by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of COMPTEL 1.809
MeV gamma-ray line observations. The simulations demonstrate that the maximum
entropy and Richardson-Lucy algorithms provide virtually identical
reconstructions which are heavily disturbed by image noise. MREM largely
suppresses this noise in the reconstructions, showing only the significant
structures that are present in the data.
  Application of MREM to COMPTEL 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line data results in a 1.809
MeV sky map that is much smoother than the maximum entropy or Richardson-Lucy
reconstructions presented previously. The essential features of this map are
(1) an asymmetric galactic ridge emission reaching from l=45 deg to l=240 deg,
  (2) a bright localised emission feature in the Cygnus region around (l,b)=(80
deg,0 deg),
  (3) two emission spots at l=317 deg and l=332 deg situated in the galactic
plane, and (4) an extended emission region around (l,b)=(160 deg, 0 deg).
Comparison of the MREM map to the simulated reconstructions demonstrates that
the 1.809 MeV emission is confined to the galactic plane.

This is especially true at the level of sensitivity, angular resolution and for

this paper an indicator of the accuracy of the separation of the CMB
anisotropies from those induced by foregrounds. Of course, the outcome will
depend on the spectral and spatial characteristics of the sources of
anisotropies. We thus start by summarising present knowledge on the spectral
and spatial properties of Galactic foregrounds, point sources, and clusters of
galaxies. This information comes in support of a modelling of the microwave sky
including the relevant components. The accuracy indicator we introduce is based
on a generalisation of the Wiener filtering method to multi-frequency,
multi-resolution data. While the development and use of this indicator was
prompted by the preparation of the scientific case for the \plancks satellite,
it has broader application since it allows assessing the effective capabilities
of an instrumental set-up once foregrounds are fully accounted for, with a view
to enabling comparisons between different experimental arrangements. The real
sky might well be different from the one assumed here, and the analysis method
might not be in the end Wiener filtering, but this work still allow meaningful
{\em comparative} studies. As a matter of examples, we compare the CMB
reconstruction errors for the \maps and \plancks space missions, as well as the
robustness of the \plancks outcome to possible failures of specific spectral
channels or global variations of the detectors noise level across spectral
channels.

  Final proof version (typos corrected and references updated). Also available

submillimetre surveys, which in principle allow an unobscured view of
dust-enshrouded star formation at high redshift. The extragalactic far-infrared
and submillimetre backgrounds have also been detected, providing further
constraints on the history of star formation. In this paper we estimate the
fraction of these backgrounds and source counts which could be explained by
AGN. The relative fractions of obscured and unobscured objects are constrained
by the requirement that they fit the spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background.
On the assumption that the spectral energy distributions of high redshift AGN
are similar to those observed locally, we find that one can explain at least
10-20 per cent of the 850 micron SCUBA sources at 1mJy and a similar fraction
of the far-infrared/submillimetre background. The exact contribution depends on
the assumed cosmology and the space density of AGN at high redshift (z>3), but
we conclude that active nuclei will be present in a significant (though not
dominant) fraction of the faint SCUBA sources. This fraction could be
significantly higher if a large population of AGN are highly obscured
(Compton-thick) at X-ray wavelengths.

embedded in a reservoir of hot gas. This gas is able to cool onto the galaxy
replenishing cold gas that is consumed by star formation. Estimates of the
X-ray luminosity emitted in the cooling region suggest a bolometric luminosity
of order 10 x 10^41 ergs/s in massive systems. We have used ROSAT PSPC data to
search for extended X-ray emission from the haloes of three nearby, massive,
late-type galaxies: NGC 2841, NGC 4594 and NGC 5529. We infer 95 per cent upper
limits on the bolometric X-ray luminosities of the haloes of NGC 2841, NGC 4594
and NGC 5529 of 0.4, 1.2 and 3.8 x 10^41 ergs/s respectively. Thus the true
luminosity lies well below the straightforward theoretical prediction. We
discuss this discrepancy and suggest a number of ways in which the theoretical
model can be brought into agreement with the observational results. A possible
solution is that the gravitational potentials of the dark matter haloes of
these galaxies are weaker than assumed in the current model. Alternatively, the
present day accretion may be substantially less than is required on average to
build the disk over the Hubble time. Our results are, however, based on only
three galaxies, none of which is ideal for this kind of study. A larger data
set is required to explore this important problem further.

time-reversible, density relaxation is controlled by {\em irreversible}
classical dynamics. In the case of a weak magnetic field, the effective kinetic
operator corresponds to diffusion in the angle space, the diffusion constant
being determined by the spectral resolution of the inhomogeneous magnetic
field. Applying these results to the quantum problem, we demonstrate that the
low-lying modes of the field theory are related to the eigenmodes of the
irreversible classical dynamics, and the higher modes are separated from the
zero mode by a gap associated with the lowest density relaxation rate. As a
consequence, we find that the long-time properties of the system are
characterised by universal Wigner-Dyson statistics. For a weak magnetic field,
we obtain a description in terms of the quasi one-dimensional non-linear

$\Theta (n^2)$ bits are necessary and sufficient for shortest path routing. By
`almost all graphs' we mean the Kolmogorov random graphs which constitute a
fraction of $1-1/n^c$ of all graphs on $n$ nodes, where $c > 0$ is an arbitrary
fixed constant. There is a model for which the average case lower bound rises
to $\Omega(n^2 \log n)$ and another model where the average case upper bound
drops to $O(n \log^2 n)$. This clearly exposes the sensitivity of such bounds
to the model under consideration. If paths have to be short, but need not be
shortest (if the stretch factor may be larger than 1), then much less space is
needed on average, even in the more demanding models. Full-information routing
requires $\Theta (n^3)$ bits on average. For worst-case static networks we
prove a $\Omega(n^2 \log n)$ lower bound for shortest path routing and all

different final states. Under the hypothesis of the conserved vector current,
the spectral function for the K\bar{K}\pi mode is compared with the
corresponding cross section for low energy e^+e^- annihilation, yielding an
axial-vector fraction of (94^{+6}_{-8})% for this mode. The branching ratio for
tau decay into all strange final states is determined to be B(\tau^-\to
X^-(S=-1)\nu_\tau)=(28.7\pm1.2)\times 10^{-3}. The measured mass spectra of the
strange tau decay modes are exploited to derive the S=-1 spectral function. A
combination of strange and nonstrange spectral functions is used to determine
the strange quark mass and nonperturbative contributions to the strange
hadronic width. A method is developed to avoid the bad convergence of the spin
zero hadronic component, with the result m_s(M_\tau^2)=(176^{+46}_{-57})
MeV/c^2. The evolution down to 1 GeV gives m_s(1 {GeV}^2) = (234^{+61}_{-76})
MeV/c^2.

discussed. Using renormalization group invariance, theories with several
independent couplings are related to a set of theories with a single coupling
parameter. The reduced theories may have particular symmetries, or they may not
be related to any known symmetry. The method is more general than the
imposition of invariance properties. Usually, there are only a few reduced
theories with an asymptotic power series expansion corresponding to a
renormalizable Lagrangian. There also exist `general' solutions containing
non-integer powers and sometimes logarithmic factors. As an example for the use
of the reduction method, the dual magnetic theories associated with certain
supersymmetric gauge theories are discussed. They have a superpotential with a
Yukawa coupling parameter. This parameter is expressed as a function of the
gauge coupling. Given some standard conditions, a unique, isolated power series
solution of the reduction equations is obtained. After reparametrization, the
Yukawa coupling is proportional to the square of the gauge coupling parameter.
The coefficient is given explicitly in terms of the numbers of colors and
flavors. `General' solutions with non-integer powers are also discussed. A

at separate points, verifying the known non-renormalization theorems. This also
implies the results are consistent with ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetry even though
the Lagrangian we use has only ${\cal N}=1$ manifest supersymmetry. We repeat
some of the calculations using supersymmetric Landau gauge and obtain, as

special case of sl_n, the conjugacy classes of principal nilpotent pairs and
