the GC M13. It is morphologically best characterized as a discontinuity in u,
u-y, with stars in the range 11,500<Teff(K)<20,000 deviating systematically
from (in the sense of appearing brighter and/or hotter than) canonical ZAHBs.
We present u, y photometry of 14 GCs obtained with 3 different telescopes
(Danish, NOT, HST) and demonstrate that the u-jump is present in every GC whose
HB extends beyond 11,500K, irrespective of [Fe/H], mixing history on the RGB,
and other GC parameters. We suggest that the u-jump is a ubiquitous feature,
intrinsic to all HB stars hotter than 11,500K. We draw a parallel between the
ubiquitous nature of the u-jump and the problem of low measured gravities among
BHB stars. We note that the ""logg-jump"" occurs over the same temperature range
as the u-jump, and that it occurs in every metal-poor GC for which gravities
have been determined--irrespective of [Fe/H], mixing history on the RGB, or any
other GC parameters. Furthermore, the u-jump and the logg-jump are connected on
a star-by-star basis. The two are likely different manifestations of the same
physical phenomenon. We present a framework which may simultaneously account
for the u-jump and the logg-jump. Reviewing spectroscopic data for several
field BHB stars, as well as two BHB stars in the GC NGC 6752, we find evidence
that radiative levitation of heavy elements takes place at Teff>11,500 K,
dramatically enhancing their abundances in the atmospheres of BHB stars in the
""critical"" temperature region. Model atmospheres taking diffusion effects into
account are badly needed, and will likely lead to better overall agreement
between canonical evolutionary theory and observations for BHB stars.

1 Galaxy IRAS 13224-3809. Previous X-ray observations of this object have shown
persistent giant variability. The degree of variability at other wavelengths
may then be used to constrain the conditions and emission processes within the
nucleus. Optical variability is expected if the electron population responsible
for the soft X-ray emission is changing rapidly and Compton-upscattering
infrared photons in the nucleus, or if the mechanism responsible for X-ray
emission causes all the emission processes to vary together. We find that there
is no significant optical variability with a firm upper limit of 2 per cent and
conclude that the primary soft X-ray emission region produces little of the
observed optical emission. The X-ray and optical emission regions must be
physically distinct and any reprocessing of X-rays into the optical waveband
occurs some distance from the nucleus. The lack of optical variability
indicates that the energy density of infrared radiation in the nucleus is at
most equal to that of the ultraviolet radiation since little is upscattered
into the optical waveband. The extremely large X-ray variability of IRAS
13224-3809 may be explained by relativistic boosting of more modest variations.
Although such boosting enhances X-ray variability over optical variability,
this only partially explains the lack of optical variability.

hierarchical structure in both space and time that resembles interstellar
turbulence, suggesting that these stars form in only a few turbulent crossing
times with positions that map out the previous gas distribution. Dense
clusters, on the other hand, are often well mixed, as if self-gravitational
motion has erased the initial fine structure. Nevertheless, some of the
youngest dense clusters also show sub-clumping, so it may be that all stellar
clustering is related to turbulence. Some of the densest clusters may also be
triggered. The evidence for mass segregation of the stars inside clusters is
reviewed, along with various explanations for this effect. Other aspects of the
theory of cluster formation are reviewed as well, including many specific
proposals for cluster formation mechanisms. The conditions for the formation of
bound clusters are discussed. Critical star formation efficiencies can be as
low as 10% if the gas removal process is slow and the stars are born at
sub-virial speeds. Environmental conditions, particularly pressure, may affect
the fraction and masses of clusters that end up bound. Globular clusters may
form like normal open clusters but in conditions that prevailed during the

based on analysis of unblended absorption features of two lines from the same
ion (in this case the Si IV doublet), which allows unambiguous separation of
covering factor and optical depth effects. The complex morphology of the
covering factor as a function of velocity suggests that the BALs are produced
by several physically separated outflows. The covering factor is ion dependent
in both depth and velocity width. We also find evidence that in BALQSO

We present reliable redshifts for 20 galaxies and redshift limits for a further
4 galaxies selected from the error-boxes of 14 submm sources. Two other submm
detections in the sample have no obvious optical counterparts, and the final
submm source was only identified from imaging data after the completion of our
spectroscopic observations. The optical identifications for 4 of the submm
sources have been confirmed through either their detection in CO at
mm-wavelengths (two pairs of galaxies at z=2.55 and z=2.80) or from the
characteristics of their spectral energy distributions (two of the central cD
galaxies in the lensing clusters). Plausible arguments based on the optical
spectral properties (starburst or AGN signatures) of the counterparts allow us
to identify a further two likely counterparts at z=1.06 and 1.16. For the
remaining 8 cases, it is not always clear which, if any, of the optical sources
identified are the true counterparts. Possible counterparts for these have
redshifts ranging from z=0.18 to z=2.11. Working with the current
identifications, we suggest that the majority of the extragalactic background
light in the submm is emitted by sources at z<3 and hence that the peak
activity in highly-obscured sources (both AGN and starbursts) lies at
relatively modest redshifts. (Abridged)

impacts or noise. Within $20 R_J$ from Jupiter (Jupiter radius, $R_J = 71,492

dust data from Galileo's prime Jupiter mission (1996 and 1997), separate dust
impacts from noise events and derive a complete denoised set of Galileo dust

of extinction. I show that the relation between the mass contained within an
iso-extinction contour and the extinction is similar from cloud to cloud and
allows the extrapolation of the maximum of extinction in the range 5.7 to 25.5
magnitudes. I found that about half of the mass is contained in regions where
the visual extinction is smaller than 1 magnitude. The star count method used
on large scale (about 250 square degrees) is a powerful and relatively
straightforward method to estimate the mass of molecular complexes. A
systematic study of the all sky would lead to discover new clouds as I did in
the Lupus complex for which I found a sixth cloud of about 10^4 solar masses.

have recently become available to determine the power sources of dust-obscured
ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We compare ISO classifications -
starburst or active galactic nucleus (AGN) - with classifications from optical
spectroscopy, and with optical/near-infrared searches for hidden broad-line
regions. The agreement between mid-infrared and optical classification is
excellent if optical LINER spectra are assigned to the starburst group. The
starburst nature of ULIRG LINERs strongly supports the suggestion that LINER
spectra in infrared-selected galaxies, rather than being an expression of the
AGN phenomenon, are due to shocks that are probably related to galactic
superwinds. Differences between ISO and optical classification provide clues on
the evolution of ULIRGs and on the configuration of obscuring dust. We find few
ISO AGN with optical HII or LINER identification, suggesting that highly
obscured AGN exist but are not typical for the ULIRG phenomenon in general.
Rather, our results indicate that strong AGN activity, once triggered, quickly
breaks the obscuring screen at least in certain directions, thus becoming
detectable over a wide wavelength range.

momenta of multiplets forming the lowest energy band in fractional quantum Hall

Coulomb and Chern-Simons interactions beyond the mean field, because these
interactions have totally different energy scales. Rather, it results from the
behavior of the Coulomb pseudopotential V(L) (pair energy as a function of pair
angular momentum) in the lowest Landau level (LL). The class of short range
repulsive pseudopotentials is defined that lead to short range Laughlin like
correlations in many body systems and to which the CF model can be applied.
These Laughlin correlations are described quantitatively using the formalism of
fractional parentage. The discussion is illustrated with an analysis of the
energy spectra obtained in numerical diagonalization of up to eleven electrons
in the lowest and excited LL's. The qualitative difference in the behavior of
V(L) is shown to sometimes invalidate the mean field CF picture when applied to
higher LL's. For example, the nu=7/3 state is not a Laughlin nu=1/3 state in
the first excited LL. The analysis of the involved pseudopotentials also
explains the success or failure of the CF picture when applied to other systems
of charged Fermions with Coulomb repulsion, such as the Laughlin quasiparticles
in the FQH hierarchy or charged excitons in an electron-hole plasma.

means of the Keldysh formalism we discuss in a unifying way both weak
localization and interaction effects in disordered systems. This allows us to
show how dephasing arises both in the particle-particle channel (weak
localization) and in the particle-hole channel (interaction effect). First we
discuss dephasing by an external field. Besides reviewing previous work on how
an external oscillating field suppresses the weak localization correction, we
derive a new expression for the effect of a field on the interaction
correction. We find that the latter may be suppressed by a static electric
field, in contrast to weak localization. We then consider dephasing due to
inelastic scattering. The ambiguities involved in the definition of the
dephasing time are clarified by directly comparing the diagrammatic approach
with the path-integral approach. We show that different dephasing times appear
in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels. Finally we comment on
recent experiments.

the rate of decay of the interactions and are known as the generalized Wigner
lattices or the most homogenenous particle configurations. The question of
stability of this beautiful and universal result against certain perturbations

Additional motivations for studying such perturbations come from surface
physics (adsorbtion on crystal surfaces) and theories of correlated fermion
systems (recent results on ground-state particle configurations of the
one-dimensional spinless Falicov-Kimball model).
  As a first step we have studied a one-dimensional lattice gas whose two-body

2-particle lattice-connected aggregates that are distributed in the most
homogeneous way. Consequently, despite breaking of the convexity property, the

derived for the case where M_3 has any non-trivial flat topology, and an exact

that the compactness in at least one spatial direction of Minkowski space-time

collisions at SPS, RHIC and LHC can tell us about the thermodynamic properties
of the hadronic system at freeze-out. By studying these fluctuations as a
function of varying control parameters, it is possible to learn much about the
phase diagram of QCD. As a timely example, we stress the methods by which
present experiments at the CERN SPS can locate the second-order critical
endpoint of the first-order transition between quark-gluon plasma and hadron
matter. Those event-by-event signatures which are characteristic of freeze-out
in the vicinity of the critical point will exhibit nonmonotonic dependence on
control parameters. We focus on observables constructed from the multiplicity
and transverse momenta of charged pions. We first consider how the
event-by-event fluctuations of such observables are affected by Bose-Einstein
correlations, by resonances which decay after freeze-out and by fluctuations in
the transverse flow velocity. We compare our thermodynamic predictions for such
noncritical event-by-event fluctuations with NA49 data, finding broad
agreement. We then focus on effects due to thermal contact between the observed
pions and a heat bath with a given (possibly singular) specific heat, and due
to the direct coupling between the critical fluctuations of the sigma field and
the observed pions. We also discuss the effect of the pions produced in the
decay of sigma particles just above threshold after freeze-out on the inclusive
pion spectrum and on multiplicity fluctuations. We estimate the size of these
nonmonotonic effects which appear near the critical point, including
restrictions imposed by finite size and finite time, and conclude that they
should be easily observable.

consequence, the VO generated seasonal variation asymmetry is given by the

model, with an eye on simplifying the application of large amplitude collective
motion techniques. At the Hartree-Bogoliubov minimum, the RPA modes are exactly
the cranking operators of the collective coordinate approach. We examine the
possibility of representing the self-consistent cranking operator by linear
combinations of a limited number of one-body operators. We study the Sm nuclei
as an example, and find that such representations exist in terms of operators
that are state-dependent in a characteristic manner.

short range correlations on the form factors and densities and of the mass
dependence of the parameters b and $\beta$. These parameters have been
determined by fit to the experimental charge form factors. The inclusion of the
correlations reproduces the experimental charge form factors at the high

$\beta$ is almost constant for the closed shell nuclei, $^4$He, $^{16}$O and
$^{40}$Ca, its values are larger (less correlated systems) for the open shell
nuclei, indicating a shell effect in the closed shell nuclei.

singular motion which joins them into a bigger drop with smaller surface area.
This motion is always viscously dominated at early times. We focus on the
early-time behavior of the radius $\rmn$ of the small bridge between the two
drops. The flow is driven by a highly curved meniscus of length $2\pi \rmn$ and
width $\Delta\ll\rmn$ around the bridge, from which we conclude that the
leading-order problem is asymptotically equivalent to its two-dimensional
counterpart. An exact two-dimensional solution for the case of inviscid
surroundings [Hopper, J. Fluid Mech. ${\bf 213}$, 349 (1990)] shows that
$\Delta \propto \rmn^3$ and $\rmn \sim (t\gamma/\pi\eta)\ln [t\gamma/(\eta
R)]$; and thus the same is true in three dimensions. The case of coalescence
with an external viscous fluid is also studied in detail both analytically and
numerically. A significantly different structure is found in which the outer
fluid forms a toroidal bubble of radius $\Delta \propto \rmn^{3/2}$ at the
meniscus and $\rmn \sim (t\gamma/4\pi\eta) \ln [t\gamma/(\eta R)]$. This basic
difference is due to the presence of the outer fluid viscosity, however small.
With lengths scaled by $R$ a full description of the asymptotic flow for
$\rmn(t)\ll1$ involves matching of lengthscales of order $\rmn^2, \rmn^{3/2}$,
\rmn$, 1 and probably $\rmn^{7/4}$.
