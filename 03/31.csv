Analysis to a preliminary sample of 5869 galaxy spectra and use the two most
significant components to split the sample into five spectral classes. These
classes are defined by considering visual classifications of a subset of the
2dF spectra, and also by comparing to high quality spectra of local galaxies.
We calculate a luminosity function for each of the different classes and find
that later-type galaxies have a fainter characteristic magnitude, and a steeper
faint-end slope. For the whole sample we find M*=-19.7 (for Omega=1, H_0=100

M*=-19.6, alpha=-0.7, while for class 5 (`late-type') we find M*=-19.0,

  cluster","27 pages, incl. 9 figures, submitted to The Astronomical Journal",,"10.1086/300985",,"astro-ph",,"  We have used the NASA Infra-Red Telescope Facility (IRTF) to observe the
nuclear stellar cluster in the nearby, face-on, giant Scd spiral IC 342. From
high resolution (R = 21500) spectra at the 12CO (2-0) bandhead at 2.3 micron we
derive a line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion sigma = (33 +- 3) km/s.
  To interpret this observation we construct dynamical models based on the
Jeans equation for a spherical system. The light distribution of the cluster is
modeled using an isophotal analysis of an HST V-band image from the HST Data
Archive, combined with new ground-based K-band imaging. Under the assumption of
an isotropic velocity distribution, the observed kinematics imply a K-band
mass-to-light ratio M/L_K = 0.05, and a cluster mass M ~ 6 times 10^6 Msun. We
model the mass-to-light ratio with the `starburst99' stellar population
synthesis models of Leitherer and collaborators, and infer a best-fitting
cluster age in the range 63-630 Myears. Although this result depends somewhat
on a number of uncertainties in the modeling (e.g., the assumed extinction
along the line-of-sight towards the nucleus, the IMF of the stellar population
model, and the velocity dispersion anisotropy of the cluster), none of these
can be plausibly modified to yield a significantly larger age. We discuss the
implications of this result on possible scenarios for the frequency of nuclear
starbursts and their impact on secular evolution of spiral galaxy nuclei.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we infer that IC 342 cannot have any central
black hole more massive than 0.5 million solar masses. This is ~ 6 times less
massive than the black hole inferred to exist in our Galaxy, consistent with
the accumulating evidence that galaxies with less massive bulges harbor less
massive black holes.

contrast of molecular clouds with respect to the Galactic background of the

produced by Galactic dust is increased with respect to previous calculations
and this is of the same order as that of the data from the observations. On the

frequency independence of anisotropies in the microwave range may be obtained.
  This leads to the possibility that under some particular, but not impossible,
conditions all the microwave background radiation anisotropies may be due to
Galactic foregrounds rather than cosmological in origin. Moreover, a suspected
coincidence between the typical angular sizes of the microwave background
radiation anisotropies and those of nearby molecular clouds makes more
plausible the hypothesis of a purely Galactic origin for these anisotropies. It
is also argued that the correlation among structures at different frequencies,
the comparison of the power spectrum at different frequencies and the galactic

invoking an accretion curtain from the disrupted, inner disc to the two poles

account the dependence on the shape and evolution of the CDM power spectrum,
and allow the bias to be nonlinear and/or evolving in time, using an extension
of Fry's (1996) bias-evolution model. We derive a scale-dependent,
leading-order correction to the standard perturbative expression for $S_3$ in
the case of nonlinear biasing, as defined for the unsmoothed galaxy and
dark-matter fields, and find that this correction becomes large when probing
positive effective power-spectrum indices. This term implies that the inferred
nonlinear-bias parameter, as usually defined in terms of the smoothed density
fields, might depend on the chosen smoothing scale. In general, we find that
the dependence of $S_3$ on the biasing scheme can substantially outweigh that
on the adopted cosmology. We demonstrate that the normalized 3PCF, $Q$, is an
ill-behaved quantity, and instead investigate $Q_V$, the variance-normalized
3PCF. The configuration dependence of $Q_V$ shows similarly strong
sensitivities to the bias scheme as $S_3$, but also exhibits significant
dependence on the form of the CDM power spectrum. Though the degeneracy of
$S_3$ with respect to the cosmological parameters and constant linear- and
nonlinear-bias parameters can be broken by the full configuration dependence of
$Q_V$, neither statistic can distinguish well between evolving and non-evolving
bias scenarios. We show that this can be resolved, in principle, by considering
the redshift dependence of $\zeta$.

more than 6 years. The modulation significance in the 0.75-30 MeV pulse-phase
distribution is 5.4 sigma and the lightcurve is similar to the lightcurves
found earlier between 0.7 and 700 keV: a single broad asymmetric pulse reaching
its maximum 0.38 +/- 0.03 in phase after the radio peak, compared to the offset
of 0.30 found in the CGRO BATSE soft gamma-ray data, and 0.27 +/- 0.01 for RXTE
(2-16 keV), compatible with ASCA (0.7-2.2 keV). Spectral analysis based on the
excess counts in the broad pulse of the lightcurve shows that extrapolation of
the OSSE power-law spectral fit with index -1.68 describes our data well up to
10 MeV. Above 10 MeV the spectrum breaks abruptly. The precise location of the
break/bend between 10 and 30 MeV depends on the interpretation of the structure
in the lightcurve measured by COMPTEL and EGRET above 10 MeV.

and an inverted radio spectrum. The optical continuum turned out to be
extremely blue. This may either indicate additional line emission, for example
from Fe I, or scattering of a blue intrinsic continuum. The X-ray spectrum
shows a clear break around 1.8 keV. Above this energy the spectrum is
characterized by a power law with a photon index of 2.1. For energies below 2
keV the spectrum can either be modeled with a steeper power law (2.7) or a
blackbody component with a temperature around 0.2 keV. The X-ray count rate of
the source decreased by a factor of two within one day and there is evidence
for low amplitude variability on much shorter time scales. Given its average
2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of 1.35e+44 erg/s, RGB J0044+193 is significantly
more variable than a typical broad line Seyfert 1 galaxy of comparable X-ray

into a circumstellar medium of approximately $r^{-2}$ density profile, at a
speed comparable to the speed of light. We assume that the efficiencies of
production of relativistic electrons and magnetic field are constant through
the evolution. The circumstellar density is consistent with that expected
around the massive star core thought to be the progenitor of SN 1998bw. The
explosion energy in material moving with velocity $>0.5c$ is $\sim 10^{49}-
3\times 10^{50}$ ergs, with some preference for the high values. The rise in
the radio light curves observed at days 20-40 is inferred to be the result of a
rise in the energy of the blast wave by a factor $\sim 2.5$. Interaction with a
jump in the ambient density is not consistent with the observed evolution. We
infer that the boost in energy is from a shell of matter from the explosion
that catches up with the decelerating shock front. Both the high explosion
energy and the nature of the energy input to the blast wave are difficult to
reconcile with energy input from the shock-accelerated high velocity ejecta

study the exact solution to the dynamics after a quench in this limit in
Minkowski space time and in radiation dominated Friedman-Robertson-Walker
Cosmology. There are some remarkable similarities between these very different
settings such as the emergence of a scaling regime and of a dynamical
correlation length at late times that describe the formation and growth of
ordered regions. In quantum field theory and cosmology this length scale is
constrained by causality and its growth in time is also associated with
coarsening and the onset of a condensate. We provide a density matrix

give particular emphasis to the decay $B_d\to J/\psi \rho^0$, which can be
combined with $B_s\to J/\psi \phi$ to extract the $B^0_d - \bar{B^0_d}$ mixing
phase and - if penguin effects in the former mode should be sizeable - also the
angle $\gamma$ of the unitarity triangle. As an interesting by-product, this
strategy allows us to take into account also the penguin effects in the
extraction of the $B^0_s - \bar{B^0_s}$ mixing phase from $B_s\to J/\psi \phi$.
Moreover, a discrete ambiguity in the extraction of the CKM angle $\beta$ can
be resolved, and valuable insights into SU(3)-breaking effects can be obtained.

related with quantization of the asymptotic Virasoro symmetry. A notion of the
Virasoro deformation of 3-geometry is introduced. For a given black hole, the
deformation of the exterior of the outer horizon is identified with a product
of appropriate coadjoint orbits of the Virasoro groups $\hat{diff S^1}_{\pm}$.
Its quantization provides unitary irreducible representations of the Virasoro
algebra, in which state of the black hole becomes primary. To make the
quantization complete, holonomies, the global degrees of freedom, are taken
into account. By an identification of these topological operators with zero
modes of the Liouville field, the aforementioned unitary representations
reveal, as far as $c \gg 1$, as the Hilbert space of this two-dimensional
conformal field theory. This conformal field theory, living on the cylinder at
infinity of the black hole and having continuous spectrums, can recognize the
outer horizon only as a it one-dimensional object in $SL_2({\bf R})$ and
realize it as insertions of the corresponding vertex operator. Therefore it can
not be a conformal field theory on the horizon. Two possible descriptions of

gravity, parametrizing the lump's width and internal orientation, may vary once
gravitational effects are included. If gravitational coupling is sufficiently
strong, the presence of the lump shrinks physical space to finite volume, and
the moduli determining the boundary value of the CP^1 field thaw also. Explicit
formulae for the metric on M_1 are found in both the weak and strong coupling
regimes. The geodesic problem for weak coupling is studied in detail, and it is
shown that M_1 is geodesically incomplete. This leads to the prediction that
self-gravitating lumps are unstable.

linear extrapolation to precisely measured Drell-Yan cross sections for 800 GeV
protons incident on a variety of nuclear targets which exhibit a deviation from
linear scaling in the atomic number A. We show that this deviation can be
accounted for by energy degradation of the proton as it passes through the
nucleus if account is taken of the time delay of particle production due to
quantum coherence. We infer an average proper coherence time of 0.4 +/- 0.1
fm/c, corresponding to a coherence path length of 8 +/- 2 fm in the rest frame
of the nucleus. Finally, we apply the linear extrapolation to measured J/Psi
production cross sections for 200 and 450 GeV/c protons incident on a variety
of nuclear targets. Our analysis takes into account energy loss of the beam
proton, the time delay of particle production due to quantum coherence, and
absorption of the J/Psi on nucleons. The best representation is obtained for a
coherence time of 0.5 fm/c, which is consistent with Drell-Yan production, and
an absorption cross section of 3.6 mb, which is consistent with the value
deduced from photoproduction of the J/Psi on nuclear targets.

quantum nature of NMR quantum computation lies in the ability to avoid an
exponential signal decrease.

A257 (1999) 232-240","10.1016/S0375-9601(99)00323-0",,"quant-ph",,"  We exhibit a specific implementation of the creation of geometrical phase
through the state-space evolution generated by the dynamic quantum Zeno effect.
That is, a system is guided through a closed loop in Hilbert space by means a
sequence of closely spaced projections leading to a phase difference with
respect to the original state. Our goal is the proposal of a specific
experimental setup in which this phase could be created and observed. To this
end we study the case of neutron spin, examine the practical aspects of
realizing the ""projections,"" and estimate the difference between the idealized
projections and the experimental implementation.

quantum system by expectation values or probabilities directly measurable in an
experiment. It is argued that the time evolution of these quantities provides
an unambiguous description of the quantal dynamics. This is shown explicitly
for a single spin s, using a quorum of expectation values which contains no
redundant information. The quantum mechanical time evolution of the system is
rephrased in terms of a closed set of linear first-order differential equations
coupling (2s+1)^2 expectation values. This `realization' of the dynamical law
refers neither to the wavefunction of the system nor to its statistical
operator.

$u(x,t_{1},t_{2},...)$ after the infinite number of shifts of $u(x,0,0,...)

free energy expansion are just obtained then as a result of quite simple
integration procedure applied to $u_{n}(x)$.

comes the same way from a solution of the functional tetrahedron equation, with
the duality replaced by the local Yang - Baxter equation.

been analysed analytically with refernce to soliton switching. For this purpose
we construct the exact general two-soliton solution of the associated coupled

analytical approach we point out that the interaction can be used as a switch
to suppress or to enhance soliton switching dynamics, if one injects
multi-soliton as an input pulse in the periodically twisted birefringent fiber.
