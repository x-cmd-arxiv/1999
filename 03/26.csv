particular, we examine the behavior in games in which the dimension of the
strategy space, m, is the same for all agents and fixed for all time. We find
that for all values of m, not too large, evolution results in a substantial
improvement in overall system performance. We also show that after evolution,
results obey a scaling relation among games played with different values of m
and different numbers of agents, analogous to that found in the
non-evolutionary, adaptive games. Best system performance still occurs, for a
given number of agents, at m_c, the same value of the dimension of the strategy
space as in the non-evolutionary case, but system performance is now nearly an
order of magnitude better than the non- evolutionary result. For m<m_c, the
system evolves to states in which average agent wealth is better than in the
random choice game,despite (and in some sense because of) the persistence of
maladaptive behavior by some agents. As m gets large, overall systems
performance approaches that of the random choice game.

memory range M.These walks are extensions of the Taylor's walk as investigated
by Goldstein, which has a memory range equal to one. At each step, with a
probability p, the random walker moves either to the right or to the left with
equal probabilities, or with a probability q=1-p performs a move, which is a
stochastic Boolean function of the M previous steps. We first derive the most
general form of this stochastic Boolean function, and study some typical cases
which ensure that the average value <R_n> of the walker's location after n
steps is zero for all values of n. In each case, using a matrix technique, we
provide a general method for constructing the generating function of the
probability distribution of R_n; we also establish directly an exact analytic
expression for the step-step correlations and the variance <R_n^2> of the walk.
  From the expression of <R_n^2>, which is not straightforward to derive from
the probability distribution, we show that, for n going to infinity, the
variance of any of these walks behaves as n, provided p>0. Moreover, in many
cases, for a very small fixed value of p, the variance exhibits a crossover
phenomenon as $n$ increases from a not too large value. The crossover takes
place for values of $n$ around 1/p. This feature may mimic the existence of a
non-trivial Hurst exponent, and induce a misleading analysis of numerical data
issued from mathematical or natural sciences experiments.

coefficients and the role of boundary conditions in interpreting whether
numerical evidence for suppression is dynamical. If a uniform field in a
periodic box serves as the initial condition for modeling the backreaction on
the turbulent EMF, then the magnitude of the turbulent EMF and thus the dynamo
coefficient $\a$, have a stringent upper limit that depends on the magnetic
Reynolds number $R_M$ to a power of order -1. This is not a dynamic suppression
but results just because of the imposed boundary conditions. In contrast, when
mean field gradients are allowed within the simulation region, or non-periodic
boundary are used, the upper limit is independent of $R_M$ and takes its
kinematic value. Thus only for simulations of the latter types could a measured
suppression be the result of a dynamic backreaction. This is fundamental for
understanding a long-standing controversy surrounding $\alpha$ suppression.
Numerical simulations which do not allow any field gradients and invoke
periodic boundary conditions appear to show a strong $\alpha$ suppression (e.g.
Cattaneo & Hughes 1996). Simulations of accretion discs which allow field
gradients and allow free boundary conditions (Brandenburg & Donner 1997)
suggest a dynamo $\alpha$ which is not suppressed by a power of $R_M$. Our
results are consistent with both types of simulations.

shapes of the daily gamma-ray energy spectra remained essentially stable
throughout the entire state of high activity despite dramatic flux variations
during this period. The derivation of a long term time-averaged energy
spectrum, based on more than 38,000 detected TeV photons, is therefore
physically meaningful. The unprecedented gamma-ray statistics combined with the
20% energy resolution of the instrument resulted in the first detection of
gamma-rays from an extragalactic source well beyond 10 TeV, and the first high
accuracy measurement of an exponential cutoff in the energy region above 5 TeV
deeply into the exponential regime. From 500 GeV to 24 TeV the differential
photon spectrum is well approximated by a power-law with an exponential cutoff:
dN/dE = N0 (E/1 TeV)^{-alpha} exp(-E/E0), with N0=(10.8 +-0.2(stat) +-2.1(sys))
1E-11/cm^2 s TeV, alpha=1.92 +-0.03(stat) +-0.20(sys), and E0=(6.2 +-0.4(stat)

constrained because of three major uncertainties: The distances to bursts, the
degree of burst beaming, and the efficiency of gamma ray production. The first
of these has been resolved, with both indirect evidence (the distribution of
bursts in flux and position) and direct evidence (redshifted absorption
features in the afterglow spectrum of GRB 970508) pointing to cosmological
distances. We now wish to address the second uncertainty. Afterglows allow a
statistical test of beaming, described in an earlier paper. In this paper, we
modify a standard fireball afterglow model to explore the effects of beaming on
burst remnant dynamics and afterglow emission. If the burst ejecta are beamed
into angle zeta, the burst remnant's evolution changes qualitatively once its
bulk Lorentz factor Gamma < 1/zeta: Before this, Gamma declines as a power law
of radius, while afterwards, it declines exponentially. This change results in
a broken power law light curve whose late-time decay is faster than expected
for a purely spherical geometry. These predictions disagree with afterglow
observations of GRB 970508. We explored several variations on our model, but
none seems able to change this result. We therefore suggest that this burst is
unlikely to have been highly beamed, and that its energy requirements were near
those of isotropic models. More recent afterglows may offer the first practical
applications for our beamed models.

slowly, encouraged by the discovery of black hole X-ray sources in our Galaxy

exhibit a transient X-ray timing signature above 50 Hz, following the 67 Hz QPO
in GRS1915+105 and the 300 Hz QPO in GRO J1655-40. However, unlike the previous
cases, which appear to show stationary frequencies, the QPO frequency in XTE
J1550-564 must vary by at least 10% to be consistent with observations. The
occurrences and properties of the QPO were insensitive to large changes in the
X-ray intensity (1.5 to 6.8 Crab). However, the QPO appearance was accompanied
by changes in the energy spectrum, namely, an increase in the temperature and a
decrease in the normalization of the thermal component. The QPO is also closely
related to the hard X-ray power-law component of the energy spectrum since the
fractional amplitude of the QPO increases with photon energy. The fast QPOs in
accreting black hole binaries are thought to be effects of general relativity;
however, the relevance of the specific physical models that have been proposed
remains largely uncertain. Low frequency QPOs in the range 3-13 Hz were often
observed. Occasionally at high luminosity the rms QPO amplitude was 15% of the
flux, a level previously reached only by GRS1915+105.

emerged in narrow longitudinal zones - `active longitudes' but over a range in
latitude. Investigating the distribution of solar magnetic flux, we have found
that the Hale sunspot polarity reversal first occurred in these active zones.
We have estimated the rotation rates of the magnetic flux in the active zones
before and after the polarity reversal. Comparing these rotation rates with the
internal rotation inferred by helioseismology, we suggest that both `old' and
`new' magnetic fluxes were probably generated in a low-latitude zone near the
base of the solar convection zone. The reversal of active region polarity
observed in certain longitudes at the beginning of a new solar cycle suggests
that the phenomenon of active longitudes may give fundamental information about
the mechanism of the solar cycle. The non-random distribution of old-cycle and

conclude that it is not an Ofpe/WN9, B[e] star or symbiotic nova although it
does share several characteristics of these systems. We suggest instead that
NaSt1 contains a massive evolved star that ejected its heavily CNO-processed
outer layers a few thousand years ago. Although the stellar remnant is
completely hidden from view by the dense nebula, we argue that the star must be
an early-type WR star. The only object that shares some of the peculiarities of
NaSt1 is eta Carinae. Whatever its true nature, NaSt1 should no longer be
considered as a late-WN classification standard in the near-IR.

to model turbulent flows. The Camassa-Holm equations, given their special
geometric and physical properties, appear particularly well suited for studying
turbulent flows. We identify the steady solution of the Camassa-Holm equation
with the mean flow of the Reynolds equation and compare the results with
empirical data for turbulent flows in channels and pipes. The data suggests
that the constant $\alpha$ version of the Camassa-Holm equations, derived under
the assumptions that the fluctuation statistics are isotropic and homogeneous,
holds to order $\alpha$ distance from the boundaries. Near a boundary, these
assumptions are no longer valid and the length scale $\alpha$ is seen to depend
on the distance to the nearest wall. Thus, a turbulent flow is divided into two
regions: the constant $\alpha$ region away from boundaries, and the near wall
region. In the near wall region, Reynolds number scaling conditions imply that
$\alpha$ decreases as Reynolds number increases. Away from boundaries, these
scaling conditions imply $\alpha$ is independent of Reynolds number. Given the
agreement with empirical and numerical data, our current work indicates that
the Camassa-Holm equations provide a promising theoretical framework from which
to understand some turbulent flows.

chemical signaling such as quorum sensing and chemotactic (bias of movement

device and the metric is non linear, the device will not measure the
`background geometry' (i.e. the geometry that solves the SEE). As a particular
example we will show that a classical particle does not follow a geodesic of
the background metric. Instead its motion is determined by a quantum corrected
geodesic equation that takes into account its coupling to the gravitons. This
analysis will also lead us to find a solution to the so-called gauge fixing

is presented. This paper is an update of the results published in [1]. The
experimental constraints imposed by the measurements of \epsilon_K,
V_{ub}/V_{cb}, \Delta m_d and from the limit on \Delta m_d are used. Values of
the constraints and of the parameters entering into the constraints, which
restrict the range of the \bar{\rho} and \bar{\eta} parameters, include recent
measurements presented at 1998 Summer Conferences and progress obtained by
lattice QCD collaborations. The results are: \bar{\rho}=0.202
^{+0.053}_{-0.059},\bar{\eta}=0.340 \pm 0.035, from which the angles \alpha,
\beta and \gamma of the unitarity triangle are inferred : \sin 2 \alpha = -0.26

(59.5^{+8.5}_{-7.5})^{\circ}. Without using the constraint from \epsilon_K,
\sin 2 \beta has been obtained: \sin 2 \beta = 0.72 ^{+0.07}_{-0.11}. Several
external measurements or theoretical inputs have been removed, in turn, from
the constraints and their respective probability density functions have been
obtained. Central values and uncertainties on these quantities have been
compared with actual measurements or theoretical evaluations. In this way it is
possible to quantify the importance of the different measurements and the
coherence of the Standard Model scenario for CP violation. An important result
is that \Delta m_s is expected to be between [12.0-17.6] ps^{-1} with 68% C.L.
and <20 ps^{-1} at 95% C.L. Finally relations between the CKM parameters and

(N_c^2-1)/R^{7}, at large distances R the interaction becomes totally

  Comments welcome, E-Mail: emqg@rogerswave.ca",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  ElectroMagnetic Quantum Gravity (EMQG) is applied to the problem of the
Cosmological Constant. EMQG is a quantum gravity theory (ref. 1) in which the
virtual particles of the quantum vacuum play a very important role in all
gravitational interactions, and also in accelerated motion. According to EMQG
theory (and quantum field theory in general), empty space is populated by vast
numbers of virtual particles, consisting of virtual fermion and virtual
anti-fermion particles, which posses mass, and also virtual boson particles of
all the various force particle species. Therefore the problem of the
cosmological constant is essentially equivalent to a determination of the mass
contributed by all the virtual particles of the vacuum to the overall curvature
and dynamics of the entire universe. Our original analysis was based on the
assumption of perfect symmetry in the creation and destruction of virtual
fermion and virtual anti-fermion particle pairs in the quantum vacuum, which is
in accordance with the existing laws of conservation of both electric charge,
and also of the new law of conservation of gravitational 'mass charge'. We now
believe that this may not be necessarily true, and that EMQG can allow the
possibility of a very tiny value for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, it
turns out that this question can only be resolved when a solution to the
problem of baryon asymmetry in the universe is resolved. In other words an
answer must be found as to why our universe seems to contain only real matter,
and very little, if any anti-matter.

effects may be expected. When the dielectric constant of the spheres
$\epsilon_s$ is greater than the dielectric constant $\epsilon_b$ of the
background medium, then for any filling fraction $f$ there exists a critical
$\epsilon_c$ above which the lowest lying Mie resonance frequency falls inside
the lowest stop gap in the (111) crystal direction, close to its midgap
frequency. If $\epsilon_s <\epsilon_b$, the correspondence between Mie
resonances and both the (111) stop gap and a full gap does not follow such a
regular pattern. If the Mie resonance frequency is close to a gap edge, one can
observe a resonance-induced widening of a relative gap width by $\approx 5%$.
