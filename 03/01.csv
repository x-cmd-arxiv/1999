used to measure the spectral and density evolution of early-type galaxies. The
mean optical SED is found to evolve passively towards a mid F-star dominated
spectrum by z ~ 2. We demonstrate with realistic simulations that hotter
ellipticals would be readily visible if evolution progressed blueward and
brightward at z > 2, following a standard IMF. The colour distributions are
best fitted by a `red' IMF, deficient above ~2 M_solar and with a spread of
formation in the range 1.5 < z_f < 2.5. Traditional age dating is spurious in
this context, a distant elliptical can be young but appear red, with an
apparent age >3 Gyrs independent of its formation redshift. Regarding density
evolution, we demonstrate that the sharp decline in numbers claimed at z > 1
results from a selection bias against distant red galaxies in the optical,
where the flux is too weak for morphological classification, but is remedied
with relatively modest IR exposures revealing a roughly constant space density
to z ~ 2. We point out that the lack of high mass star-formation inferred here
and the requirement of metals implicates cooling-flows of pre-enriched gas in
the creation of the stellar content of spheroidal galaxies. Deep-field X-ray
images will be very helpful to examine this possibility.

$\gamma \simeq 70^\circ$ are deduced from the experimental values of $|V_{us}|$
and $|V_{cb}|$ (with the use of quark masses m_s, m_c and m_b). In the last
three Sections, the option of two sorts, $\enu$ and $\mnu$, of sterile
neutrinos is considered. They may dominate neutrino mixing, and even cause that
two extra neutrino mass states (arising then) are agents of some tiny neutrino
instability and related damping of $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ oscillations. In
Appendix, three conventional Majorana sterile neutrinos are discussed.

gravitational couplings, including both threshold corrections and corrections
due to the mixed Kahler-gravitational anomaly. We find that string loops can
drive the evolution into the region of the parameter space where a graceful
exit is in principle possible, and we find solutions that, in the string frame,
connect smoothly the superinflationary pre-big-bang evolution to a phase where
the curvature and the derivative of the dilaton are decreasing. We also find
that at a critical coupling the loop corrections to the Kahler potential induce
a ghost-like instability, i.e. the kinetic term of the dilaton vanishes. This
is similar to what happens in Seiberg-Witten theory and signals the transition
to a new regime where the light modes in the effective action are different and
are related to the original ones by S-duality. In a string context, this means
that we enter a D-brane dominated phase.

all logical paradoxes, that of the Liar, are related closely is, of course, not
only well known, but is a part of the common knowledge of logician community.
Actually, almost every more or less formal treatment of the theorem (including,
for that matter, Godel's original paper as well) makes a reference to this
connection. In the light of the fact that the existence of this connection is a
commonplace, all the more surprising that very little can be learnt about its
exact nature. Now, it emerges from what we do in this paper that the general
ideas underlying the three central limitation theorems of mathematics, those
concerning the incompleteness and undecidability of arithmetic and the
undefinability of truth within it can be taken as different ways to resolve the
Liar paradox. In fact, an abstract formal variant of the Liar paradox
constitutes a general conceptual schema that, revealing their common logical
roots, connects the theorems referred to above and, at the same time,
demonstrates that, in a sense, these are the only possible relevant limitation
theorems formulated in terms of truth and provability alone that can be
considered as different manifestations of the Liar paradox. On the other hand,
as illustrated by a simple example, this abstract version of the paradox opens
up the possibility to formulate related results concerning notions other than
just those of the truth and provability.

the radial function of the body. A parallel section function (or
(n-1)-dimensional X-ray) gives the ((n-1)-dimensional) volumes of all
hyperplane sections of the body orthogonal to a given direction. This formula
provides a new characterization of intersection bodies in R^n and leads to a
unified analytic solution to the Busemann-Petty problem: Suppose that K and L
are two origin-symmetric convex bodies in R^n such that the ((n-1)-dimensional)
volume of each central hyperplane section of K is smaller than the volume of
the corresponding section of L; is the (n-dimensional) volume of K smaller than
the volume of L? In conjunction with earlier established connections between
the Busemann-Petty problem, intersection bodies, and positive definite
distributions, our formula shows that the answer to the problem depends on the
behavior of the (n-2)-nd derivative of the parallel section functions. The
affirmative answer to the Busemann-Petty problem for n\le 4 and the negative
answer for n\ge 5 now follow from the fact that convexity controls the second
derivatives, but does not control the derivatives of higher orders.

does it follow that the volumes of the bodies themselves satisfy vol(K) <

answer for n <= 12 was given by Larman and Rogers in 1975. Subsequently, a
series of contributions were made to reduce the dimensions to n >= 5 by a
number of authors. That is, the problem has a negative answer for n >= 5. It
was proved by Gardner that the problem has a positive answer for n=3. The case
of n=4 was considered in [Ann. of Math. (2) 140 (1994), 331-346], but the
answer given there is not correct. This paper presents the correct solution,
namely, the Busemann-Petty problem has a positive solution in R^4, which,
