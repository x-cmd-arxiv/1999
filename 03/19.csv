network of selectively neutral genotypes. We show that the population's limit
distribution on the neutral network is solely determined by the network
topology and given by the principal eigenvector of the network's adjacency
matrix. Moreover, the average number of neutral mutant neighbors per individual
is given by the matrix spectral radius. This quantifies the extent to which
populations evolve mutational robustness: the insensitivity of the phenotype to
mutations. Since the average neutrality is independent of evolutionary
parameters---such as, mutation rate, population size, and selective
advantage---one can infer global statistics of neutral network topology using
simple population data available from {\it in vitro} or {\it in vivo}
evolution. Populations evolving on neutral networks of RNA secondary structures
show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.

cooler temperature component of the 2T models. A simple multiphase cooling flow
model gives results analogous to the 2T models including large metallicities,
<Z> = 0.65 +/- 0.17 Z_sun. The nearly solar Fe abundances and also solar
alpha/Fe ratios indicated by the 2T and cooling flow models are consistent with
models of the chemical enrichment of ellipticals, groups, and clusters which
assume ratios of Type Ia to Type II supernova and an IMF similar to those of
the Milky Way.
  Thus, we have shown that the very sub-solar Fe abundances and Si/Fe
enhancements obtained from most previous studies within r ~100 kpc of galaxy
groups are an artifact of their fitting isothermal models to the X-ray spectra

the ``Fe bias'' and ``Si bias'' associated with the spectral fitting of
ellipticals, groups, and clusters of galaxies.

the emitting jets of the BL Lac objects in a regime of low accretion. We show
that the timescale for the BZ process to exhaust the rotational energy of the

uniform enough to yield an intrinsically slow population evolution, giving rise
to number counts of ``Euclidean'' or flatter shape; even longer timescales
apply to the additional, analogous process involving the inner accretion disk
directly. Such slow evolution takes place in ambients and at epochs (z \lsim 1)
where interactions of the host galaxies with companions become rare or weak. On
the other hand, at higher z, we argue that frequent interactions of the hosts
within groups enhanced, each for some 10^{-1} Gyr, the accretion rates and the
emissions from the disks, attaining power levels that are typical of the
radio-loud quasars. But such interactions were also likely to disorder the
large-scale magnetic field in the disk and to decrease angular momentum of the
hole, thus limiting the lifetime of all BZ emissions to under a few gigayears.
Then the stronger evolution of the flat-spectrum radio-loud quasars was driven,
similar to the radio-quiet ones, by the interaction rate decreasing rapidly
with z.

of a quadrupole component in the CMB temperature distribution. Measuring the
polarization towards distant clusters provides the unique opportunity to
observe the evolution of the CMB quadrupole at moderate redshifts, z~0.5-3. We
demonstrate that for the local cluster population the polarization degree will
depend on the cluster celestial position. There are two extended regions in the
sky, which are opposite to each other, where the polarization is maximal,
0.1(tau/0.02) microK in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the CMB spectrum (tau being
the Thomson optical depth across the cluster) exceeding the contribution from
the cluster transverse peculiar motion if v_t<1300 km/s. One can hope to detect
this small signal by measuring a large number of clusters, thereby effectively
removing the systematic contribution from other polarization components
produced in clusters. These polarization effects, which are of the order of
(v_t/c)^2 tau, (v_t/c) tau^2 and (kT_e/m_ec^2) tau^2, as well as the
polarization due to the CMB quadrupole, were previously calculated by Sunyaev

results and present exact frequency dependencies for all these effects. The
polarization is considerably higher in the Wien region of the CMB spectrum.

deformations are manifested by imposing motions on the bounding planes to which
the magnetic field is anchored. Once imposed the new distribution of magnetic
footpoints are then taken to be fixed, so that the rest of the plasma must then
relax to a new equilibrium configuration. For the class of footpoint motions we
have examined, we find that singular and nonsingular equilibria can be
generated. By singular we mean that within the limits imposed by numerical
resolution we find that there is no convergence to a well-defined equilibrium
as the number of grid points in the numerical domain is increased. These
singular equilibria contain current ""sheets"" of ever-increasing current
intensity and decreasing width; they occur when the footpoint motions exceed a

in particular yield the cosmological density parameters of baryons and matter

polarization of this scattered radiation, but did suggest that the degree of
such polarization might be large. In this Letter we report on improved
calculations for these \lya halos, now accounting for the polarization of the
radiation field. The polarization is linear and is oriented tangentially to the
projected displacement from the center of the source. The degree of
polarization is found to be 14% at the core radius, where the intensity has
fallen to half of the central value. It rises to 32% and 45% at the radii where
the intensity has fallen to one-tenth and one-hundreth of the central

further, asymptotically to 60%. Such high values of polarization should be
easily observable and provide a clear signature of the phenomenon of \lya halos
surrounding sources prior to reionization.

Redshifts and equivalent widths of several spectral features (e.g., H\alpha and

the star-forming and absorption-line systems. The spectroscopic sample is
corrected for incompleteness and used to estimate the 1.4 GHz and H\alpha

of the star-forming population has a much steeper faint-end slope (1.85) than
that for the ellipticals (1.35). This implies an increasing preponderance of
star-forming galaxies among the optically identified (i.e., z < 1) radio
sources at fainter flux densities. The H\alpha LF of the faint radio population
agrees with published H\alpha LFs derived from local samples selected by
H\alpha emission. This suggests that the star-forming faint radio population is
coincident with the H\alpha selected galaxies. The 1.4 GHz and H\alpha

observed for local starburst galaxies. Both methods give lower-limit

describe how three main research programmes in quantum gravity treat four
topics of particular importance: the scope of standard quantum theory; the
nature of spacetime; spacetime diffeomorphisms, and the so-called problem of
time. By and large, these programmes accept most of the ingredient theories'
treatment of spacetime, albeit with a metric with some type of quantum nature;
but they also suggest that the treatment has fundamental limitations. This
prompts the idea of going further: either by quantizing structures other than
the metric, such as the topology; or by regarding such structures as
phenomenological. We discuss this in Section \ref{Sec:TowardsQuST}.

closed cosmology is presented as a function of b, a parameter of the model that
is proportional to the relative rotation of the average inertial frame and the
bulk of matter in the universe. It is assumed (through the equation of state)
that a relativistic early universe is followed by a matter-dominated late
universe. The action is used in a saddlepoint approximation to a semiclassical
estimate for the wave function in quantum cosmology to explain why our inertial
frame seems not to rotate relative to the stars. The saddlepoint is at b=0, as
would be expected. Application of the saddlepoint approximation leads to the
result that only those classical geometries whose action differs from the
saddlepoint value for the action by an amount less than Planck's constant
contribute significantly to the integration to give the present value of the
wave function. Using estimates for our universe implies that only those
classical geometries for which the present relative rotation rate of inertial
frames and matter are less than about 10^(-130) radians per year contribute
significantly to the integration. This is well below the limit set by

fifth degree polynomial. At the method's core is a rational mapping of the
Riemann sphere with the icosahedral symmetry of a general quintic. Moreover,
this map posseses ""reliable"" dynamics: for almost any initial point, its
trajectory converges to one of the periodic cycles that comprise an icosahedral
orbit. This symmetry-breaking provides for a reliable or ""generally-convergent""
quintic-solving algorithm: with almost any fifth-degree equation, associate a
rational map that has reliable dynamics and whose attractor consists of points
from which one computes a root.
  An algorithm that solves the sixth-degree equation requires a dynamical
system with the symmetry of the alternating group on six things. This group
does not act on the Riemmann sphere, but does act on the complex projective
plane--this is the Valentiner group. The present work exploits the resulting
2-dimensional geometry in finding a Valentiner-symmetric rational map whose
elegant dynamics experimentally appear to be reliable in the above
sense--transferred to the 2-dimensional setting. This map provides the central
feature of a conjecturally-reliable sextic-solving procedure analogous to that
employed in the quintic case. The paper culminates in an explicit description
of the algorithm.
