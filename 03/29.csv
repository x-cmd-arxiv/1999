  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/307761",,"astro-ph",,"  The X-ray spectra of two intermediate type Seyfert galaxies are investigated
using ASCA observations separated by more than a year. Both NGC 4388 and ESO
103-G35 exhibit strong, narrow Fe K alpha line emission and absorption by cold
neutral gas with a column density ~ 10^23 cm^-2, characteristic of the X-ray
spectra of type 2 Seyfert galaxies. The power law continuum flux has changed by
a factor of 2 over a time-scale of ~ 2 years for both objects, declining in the
case of NGC 4388 and rising in ESO 103-G35. No variation was observed in the
equivalent width of the Fe K alpha line in the spectra of NGC 4388, implying
that the line flux declined with the continuum. We find that the strength of
the line cannot be accounted for by fluorescence in line-of-sight material with
the measured column density unless a `leaky-absorber' model of the type favored
for IRAS 04575-7537 is employed. The equivalent width of the Fe K alpha
emission line is seen to decrease between the observations of ESO 103-G35 while
the continuum flux increased. The 1996 observation of ESO 103-G35 can also be
fitted with an absorption edge at 7.4 $\pm$ 0.2 keV due to partially ionized
iron, and when an ionized absorber model is fitted to the data it is found that
the equivalent column of neutral hydrogen rises to 3.5 x 10^23 cm^-2. The Fe K
alpha line flux can be accounted by fluorescence in this material alone and
this model is also a good representation of the 1988 and 1991 Ginga
observations. There is then no requirement for a reflection component in the
ASCA spectra of ESO 103-G35 or NGC 4388.

  to MNRAS (March 1999)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We calculate the maximum fraction of matter which is able to condense out of
the expanding background universe, for any universe which will expand forever.
We use a simple spherical model for the growth of density fluctuations in the
universe. This model includes open, matter-dominated universe and universes in
which there is an uniform background component (e.g. the cosmological constant
or ""quintessence""). In these background universes, Omega eventually drops
significantly below unity. When this happens, gravitational instability is
suppressed and, with it, so is the growth of the collapsed fraction.
  We identify a limitation of the Press-Schechter (PS) approximation. In this
approximation, the mass function determined from the predicted collapse of
overdense regions is multiplied by a correction factor of 2, assuming that each
bound fluctuation will accrete an equal share of mass from nearby underdense
regions. Our model determines the actual value of the correction factor. We
show that, while the factor of 2 adopted by the PS approximation is correct for
an Einstein-de Sitter universe, it is not correct when the freeze-out of
fluctuation growth inherent in the more general class of background universes
described above occurs. When freeze-out occurs, the correction factor reduces
to unity and the PS approximation must overestimate the collapsed fraction.
  We apply our model to open CDM and flat Lambda-CDM models. For H0=70 and
Omega0=0.3, these models yield asymptotic collapsed fractions of 0.0361 and
0.0562, respectively, on the galaxy cluster mass-scale, only 55% of the values
determined by the PS approximation. These results have implications for the use
of the latter approximation to compare the observed space density of X-ray
clusters today with that predicted by cosmological models.

developed by Fux via comparison with an unbiased, homogeneous sample of OH/IR
stars. Via Monte-Carlo simulation, we find the plausibilities of the

constrained best by these projected data are the total mass of the model and
the viewing angle of the central Bar, although the distribution of the latter
has multiple maxima. The best model has a viewing angle of 44 degrees,
semi-major axis of 2.5 kpc, a bar mass of 1.7E10 solar masses and a tangential
velocity of the local standard of rest of 171 km/s . We argue that the lower
values that are commonly found from stellar data for the viewing angle (around
25 degrees) arise when too few coordinates are available, when the longitude
range is too narrow or when low latitudes are excluded from the fit. The new
constraints on the viewing angle of the galactic Bar from stellar line-of-sight
velocities decrease further the ability of the Bar's distribution to account
for the observed micro-lensing optical depth toward Baade's window : our model
reproduces only half the observed value. The signal of triaxiality diminishes
quickly with increasing latitude, fading within approximately one scaleheight.
This suggests that Baade's window is not a very appropriate region to sample
Bar properties.

with ROSAT, show strong absorption lines of NV, CIV and SiIV, extending over a
velocity range from -1000 to -5000 km/s with respect to the corresponding line
centre. Our analysis shows that the Broad Emission Line Region (BELR) is, at
least partially, covered by the material causing these absorption lines. In the
IUE spectrum taken in Jan. 1995, the continuum was a factor of two brighter and
the UV absorption lines are found to be considerably weaker than in 1992, but
only little variation in the emission line fluxes is found. With UV spectral
indices of A_{uv} \simeq 1.82 and 1.46 for the 1992 and 1995 data, the far UV
spectrum is steep. Based on the emission line ratios and the broad band
spectral energy distribution, we argue that the steepness of the UV spectrum is
unlikely to be due to reddening. The soft X-ray emission in the ROSAT band is
weak. A simple power-law model yields a very poor fit with a UV-to-X-ray
spectral index A_{uvx}=2.32. Highly ionized (warm) absorption is suggested by
the ROSAT data. After correcting for a warm absorber, the optical to X-ray

galaxy NGC5506. 2-10 keV band are detected during a 1-day ASCA observation,
while no significant change in the 2-10 keV continuum shape is found. The ASCA
spectrum consists of an absorbed power-law, a 'soft excess' below 2 keV, and an
Fe K$\alpha$ emission line at 6.4 keV. The 'soft excess' can be well described
by either thermal emission from very low abundance material at a temperature
kT$\simeq$0.8 keV, or scattered/leaking flux from the primary power-law plus a
small amount of thermal emission. Analysis of ROSAT HRI data reveals that the
soft X-ray emission is extended on kpc scales in this object, and the extended
component may account for most of the soft X-ray excess observed by the ASCA.
The result suggests that in this type 2 AGN, the 'soft excess' at least partly
comes from an extended region, imposing serious problem for the model in which
the source is partially covered. Fe K$\alpha$ profile is complex and can not be
satisfactorily modeled by a single gaussian. Models of either double gaussians,
or a narrow gaussian plus a line from a relativistic accretion disk viewed at
an inclination of about 40$\pm10^\circ$ provide good fits to the data. However,
the inclination of the disk can be substantially larger if there is a small
amount of excessive Fe K edge absorption. The intermediate inclinations for
NLXGs are consistent with the ideas that the inner accretion disk is aligned
with the outer obscuring torus.

within which hybrid inflation is `naturally' realized, is discussed. The mu
problem is solved via a Peccei-Quinn symmetry. Light neutrinos acquire
hierarchical masses by the seesaw mechanism. They are taken from the small
angle MSW resolution of the solar neutrino puzzle and the SuperKamiokande data.
The range of parameters consistent with maximal nu_mu-nu_tau mixing and the
gravitino constraint is determined. The baryon asymmetry of the universe is
generated through a primordial leptogenesis. The subrange of parameters, where
the baryogenesis constraint is also met, is specified. The required values of
parameters are more or less `natural'.

that Besicovitch sets of near-minimal dimension have to satisfy certain strong

approach based on a coupled channel formalism which allows to include the

adopted from a meson exchange model with pi, rho, omega, and sigma exchange
taken into account. The influence of the residual interaction on the deuteron
