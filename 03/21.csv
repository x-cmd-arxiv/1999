X-ray Timing Explorer proportional counter array produced a high quality
spectrum in the 2 - 30 keV range. Joint fitting with the 0.7 - 11 keV spectrum
obtained with the Advanced Satellite for Astrophysics and Cosmology gas imaging
spectrometer gives an upperlimit of 2.3x10^-7 photons/cm^2/sec/keV for
non-thermal emission at 30 keV. This yields a lower limit to the mean magnetic
field of 0.36 micro Gauss (uG) and an upperlimit of 1.8x10^-13 ergs/cm^3 for
the cosmic-ray electron energy density. The resulting lower limit to the
central magnetic field is ~1 - 3 uG While a magnetic field of ~0.1 - 0.2 uG can
be created by galaxy wakes, a magnetic field of several uG is usually
associated with a cooling flow or, as in the case of the Coma cluster, a
subcluster merger. However, for A2256, the evidence for a merger is weak and
the main cluster shows no evidence of a cooling flow. Thus, there is presently
no satisfactory hypothesis for the origin of an average cluster magnetic field
as high as >0.36 uG in the A2256 cluster.

of an evolutionary optimisation process, one may conjecture that such systems
use resources like energy very efficiently, but there is no proof for this.
Recent results on driven systems indicate that systems composed of competing
entities tend to reach a state of self-organised optimality associated with
minimal interaction or minimal dissipation, respectively. Using concepts from
non-equilibrium thermodynamics and game theoretical ideas, we will show that
this is universal to an even wider class of systems which, generally speaking,
have the ability to reach a state of maximal overall ``success''. This
principle is expected to be relevant for driven systems in physics, but its

other, to be treated as single distorted black hole (close limit
approximation), providing at the same time useful benchmarks for full numerical
simulations. Here we summarize the most recent developments to study evolutions
of perturbations around rotating (Kerr) black holes. The final aim is to
generalize the close limit approximation to the most general case of two
rotating black holes in orbit around each other, and thus provide reliable
templates for the gravitational waveforms in this regime. For this reason it
has become very important to know if these predictions can actually be trusted
to larger separation parameters (even in the region where the holes have
distinct event horizons). The only way to extend the range of validity of the
linear approximation is to develop the theory of second order perturbations
around a Kerr hole, by generalizing the Teukolsky formalism.
