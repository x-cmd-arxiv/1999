  of the Horizontal Branch Oscillation in the Z Sources","29 pages, 12 figures, and 3 tables. To appear in the Astrophysical
  Journal",,"10.1086/307460",,"astro-ph",,"  We study the horizontal branch oscillations (HBO) and the two simultaneous
kilohertz QPOs comparing their properties in five Z sources with the
predictions of the magnetospheric beat-frequency and Lense-Thirring precession
models. We find that the variation of the HBO frequency with accretion rate
predicted by the magnetospheric beat-frequency model for a purely dipolar
stellar magnetic field and a radiation-pressure-dominated inner accretion disk
agrees well with the observed variation. This model implies that the neutron
stars in the Z sources are near magnetic spin equilibrium, that their magnetic
field strengths are ~10^9-10^10 G, and that the critical fastness parameter for
these sources is >0.8. If the frequency of the upper kilohertz QPO is an
orbital frequency in the accretion disk, the magnetospheric beat-frequency
model requires that a small fraction of the gas in the disk does not couple
strongly to the stellar magnetic field at 3-4 stellar radii but instead drifts
slowly inward in nearly circular orbits until it is within a few kilometers of
the neutron star surface. The Lense-Thirring precession model is consistent
with the observed magnitudes of the HBO frequencies only if the moments of
inertia of the neutron stars in the Z sources are 4-5 times larger than the
largest values predicted by realistic neutron-star equations of state. The
trend of the correlation between the HBO and upper kHz QPO frequencies is not
consistent with this model. We argue that the change in the slope of the
correlation between the frequency of the horizontal branch oscillation and the
frequency of the upper kilohertz QPO, when the latter is greater than 850 Hz,
is directly related to the varying frequency separation of the kilohertz QPOs.

can be as long as ~ a few seconds, consistent with Ginga results. The
difference between the superposed shot profile in different energy bands can be
attributed to the time lag and the different shot width between different
energy bands. The shot width defined from the auto-correlation function of shot

power-law with 2 thermal components, or by a broken power-law and a single
thermal component. In both cases the softer thermal emission dominates at less
than 0.3 keV and is seen through a column of a few 10^19 atom cm^-2. The other
components have columns consistent with the mean line of sight value. The metal
abundances for the thermal components are poorly constrained, but consistent
with cosmic values. The power-law together with 2 thermal components model has
been used to fit recent combined ASCA and ROSAT CXB measurements. Here, the
soft thermal component is interpreted as emission from the local hot bubble and
the hard thermal component as emission from a more distant absorbed region.
While such a 2 component thermal model is consistent with the LECS spectrum, it
is not required, and the hard thermal component may result from inadequate
modeling of the extragalactic contribution. The observed low-energy spectral
complexity may therefore originate primarily in the local hot bubble. There is
no evidence for the presence of a very soft CXB component with a temperature
<0.1 keV. The emission measure seen by ROSAT is rejected at 90% confidence.

Monte Carlo simulations. Through the computation of the autocorrelation
C(t+t_w,t_w) and the integrated response (susceptibility) functions we obtain
the FDT violation factor X(t+t_w,t_w) for different values of the temperature,
the waiting time t_w and the quotient delta=J_0/J_d, J_0 and J_d being the
strength of exchange and dipolar interactions respectively. For positive values
of delta this system develops a striped phase at low temperatures, in which the
non-equilibrium dynamics presents two different regimes. Our results show that
such different regimes are not reflected in the FDT violation factor, where X
goes always to zero for high values of t_w in the aging regime, a result that
appears in domain growth processes in non-frustrated ordered systems.

The application of this approach to the computation of piezoelectric

the (``improper'') piezoelectric coefficients from finite differences of the
polarization at nearby strain states leads to a dependence upon the choice of
``branch'' of the polarization. The purpose of the present paper is to clarify
that if one calculates instead the ``proper'' piezoelectric response, the

account, at the level of transition amplitudes, the change of the geometry
induced by the emission process. This enlarged description reveals that the
dynamical variables which govern the emission are the horizon area and its
conjugate time variable. Their conjugation is established through the boundary
term at the horizon which must be added to the canonical action of general
relativity in order to obtain a well defined action principle when the area
varies. These coordinates have already been used by Teitelboim and
collaborators to compute the partition function of a black hole. We use them to
show that the probability to emit a particle is given by $e^{- \Delta A/4}$
where $\Delta A$ is the decrease in horizon area induced by the emission. This
expression improves Hawking result which is governed by a temperature (given by
the surface gravity) in that the specific heat of the black hole is no longer
neglected. The present derivation of quantum black hole radiation is based on
the same principles which are used to derive the first law of classical black
hole thermodynamics. Moreover it also applies to quantum processes associated
with cosmological or acceleration horizons. These two results indicate that not
only black holes but all event horizons possess an entropy which governs
processes according to quantum statistical thermodynamics.

give a lower bound for the genus of curves lying on general surfaces. First we
translate and reprove Xu's result that any curve C on a general surface in P^3
of degree d>4 has geometric genus g > 1 + deg(C)(d - 5)/2. Then we prove a
similar lower bound for the curves lying on a general surface in a given
component of the Noether-Lefschetz locus in P^3 and on a general projectively
Cohen-Macaulay surface in P^4.

stable curves (i.e. cusp-curve of Gromov, or stable maps of Kontsevich and
Manin) in general setting: An almost complex structure on a target manifold is
only continuous and can vary; the curves are only assumed to have fixed
``topological type'', in particular they can be non-closed and the complex
structures on them can vary arbitrarily.
  In connection with this, we study in \S 2 moduli spaces of nodal curves with
boundary and define a natural complex structure for such moduli spaces.
  We obtain an apriori estimate for pseudoholomorphic maps of ``long
cylinders'' (see \S 3), which gives a uniform description for degeneration of
complex structure on the curves and for the ``bubbling'' phenomenon. It also
implies the Hausdorff convergence of the curves.
  We also prove in \S 5 the compactness theorem for curves with boundary on
totally real submanifolds. For this ``boundary'' case we give appropriate
generalizations of all ``inner'' constructions and estimates.
