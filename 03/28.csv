galaxies at large lookback times, both in dense clusters and the field.
Dramatic transformations in star formation histories (even morphologies) appear
to prevail among all types of galaxies and in all environments, and these can
be traced to relatively recent times (z ~ 0.2). This article updates to
December 1998 a review made in 1994 to cover the recent watershed of
observational results emerging from the Hubble Deep Field and deep surveys made
with large ground-based telescopes.

used to systematically generate and compare bicontinuous cubic structures in
the framework of a Ginzburg-Landau model for ternary amphiphilic systems. Both
single and double structures are investigated; they correspond to systems with
one or two monolayers in a unit cell, respectively. We show how and why single
structures can be made to approach triply periodic minimal surfaces very
closely, and give improved nodal approximations for G, D, I-WP and P surfaces.
We demonstrate that the relative stability of the single structures can be
calculated from the geometrical properties of their interfaces only. The single
gyroid G turns out to be the most stable bicontinuous cubic phase since it has
the smallest porosity. The representations are used to calculate distributions
of the Gaussian curvature and 2H-NMR bandshapes for C(P), C(D), S, C(Y) and
F-RD surfaces.

The magnitude of the signal, which is observed in a narrow temperature interval
less than 2K and for fields up to about twice the irradiation field, is used to
estimate the the energy gained by vortex pinning on the defects. The vanishing
of the effective pinning energy at a temperature below Tc is attributed to its

'hybrid dynamics' can be constructed to account for the generic interaction
