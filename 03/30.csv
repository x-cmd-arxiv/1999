peculiar X-ray binary Cygnus X-3. The observations cover quiescent, small
flaring and outburst states of the system as defined by radio and X-ray
monitoring. The underlying infrared spectrum of the source, as observed during
radio and X-ray quiescence and small flaring states, is one of broad, weak HeII
and NV emission. Spectral variability in this state is dominated by modulation
at the 4.8 hr orbital period of the system. H-band spectra confirm the
significant hydrogen depletion of the mass donor. The closest spectral match to
the quiescent infrared spectrum of Cyg X-3 is an early-type WN Wolf-Rayet star.
  In outburst, the infrared spectrum is dramatically different, with the
appearance of very strong twin-peaked HeI emission displaying both day-to-day
variability and V(iolet)/R(ed) variations with orbital phase. The most likely
explanation appears to be an enhanced stellar wind from the companion. Thus
X-ray and radio outbursts in this system are likely to originate in
mass-transfer, and not disc, instabilities, and the lengthening of the orbital
period will not be smooth but will be accelerated during these outbursts.
Furthermore, the appearance of these lines is suggestive of an asymmetric
emitting region. We propose that the wind in Cyg X-3 is significantly flattened
in the plane of the binary orbit. This may explain the observed twin-peaked HeI
features as well as reconciling a massive Wolf-Rayet secondary with the
relatively small optical depth to X-rays, if the disc wind is inclined at some
angle to the line of sight.

to the radius that gas will be stripped from a galaxy. However, at small radii
it is also important to consider the potential provided by the bulge component.
A spiral galaxy passing through the core of a rich cluster such as Coma, will
have its gaseous disk truncated to $\sim 4$ kpc, thus losing $\sim 80%$ of its
diffuse gas mass. The timescale for this to occur is a fraction of a crossing
time $\sim 10^7$ years. Galaxies orbiting within poorer clusters, or inclined
to the direction of motion through the intra-cluster medium will lose
significantly less gas. We conclude that ram-pressure alone is insufficient to
account for the rapid and widespread truncation of star-formation observed in
cluster galaxies, or the morphological transformation of Sab's to S0's that is
necessary to explain the Butcher-Oemler effect.

near the systemic velocity, which probably arises in the interstellar medium of
the host galaxy. Compared to GHRS spectra of the N V and C IV absorption
obtained ~2 years earlier, the kinematic components have not changed in radial
velocity, but the ionic column densities for two components have decreased. We
attribute these variations to changes in the total column of gas, but for one

  We have calculated photoionization models to match the UV column densities
from each of the five components associated with the nucleus. In four of the

column densities (N = 6.0 x 10^18 cm^-2 -- 2.8 x 10^20 cm^-2) cannot produce

previous well-studied radio afterglows which rise to peak flux on a timescale
of a week and then decay over several weeks to months, the radio emission from
this GRB was clearly detected one day after the burst, after which it rapidly
faded away. The simplest interpretation of this ``radio flare'' is that it
arises from the reverse shock. In the framework of the afterglow models
discussed to date, a forward shock origin for the flare is ruled out by our
data. However, at late times, some radio afterglow emission (commensurate with
the observed late-time optical emission, the optical afterglow) is expected
from the forward shock. The relative faintness of the observed late-time radio
emission provides an independent indication for a jet-like geometry in this
GRB. We use the same radio observations to constrain two key parameters of the
forward shock, peak flux and peak frequency, to within a factor of two. These
values are inconsistent with the notion advocated by several authors that the
prompt optical emission detected by ROTSE smoothly joins the optical afterglow
emission. Finally, with hindsight we now recognize another such radio flare and
this suggests that one out of eight GRBs has a detectable radio flare. This
abundance coupled with the reverse shock interpretation suggests that the radio
flare phenomenon has the potential to shed new light into the physics of
reverse shocks in GRBs.

instability in HSBs leads to substantial loss of angular momentum of the

brightness profile. A simple modeling of color evolution and interactions
driven star formation gives M/L ratios for the remnants that are roughly

derive the intensity and frequency of the scattered photons for a monochromatic

spectrum of the incoming radiation using the intensity to determine the correct
weight. This method makes it possible to study the emerging radiation as a
function of frequency and direction. As a first application we have studied the
effects of finite optical depth and gas infall on the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
(not possible with the extended Kompaneets equation) and discuss the parameter
range in which the Boltzmann equation and its expansions can be used. For high
temperature clusters ($k_B T_e \gtrsim 15$ keV) relativistic corrections based
on a fifth order expansion of the extended Kompaneets equation seriously
underestimate the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect at high frequencies. The
contribution from plasma infall is less important for reasonable velocities. We

connects the inner radio lobe and the NML and that is imaged for the first

on the eastern side. The radio morphology of Centaurus A and, in particular,
its NML could be the result of a precessing jet that has undergone a strong
interaction with the environment at least in the northern side. The very big
drop in intensity between the inner jet and the large-scale jet can be
explained with a sequence of bursts of activity at different epochs in the life
of the source. Alternatively (or additionally) a ``bursting bubble'' model is
proposed which could also explain the good collimation of the large-scale jet.
In this model, the plasma accumulated in the inner lobe would be able to
``burst'' out only through one nozzle that would be the region where the
large-scale jet forms. From the comparison between the radio emission and the
regions of ionized gas we find that the inner optical filament falls about 2
arcmin (~2 kpc) away from the large-scale radio jet. Thus, this filament does
not seem to have experienced a direct interaction with the radio plasma. The
outer filaments appear to be, in projection, closer to the radio emission,

absorption edge, whose threshold energy is consistent with K-shell
photoionization from OVII. The amount of reflection and the iron line
properties are consistent with both being produced in a plane-parallel, X-ray

bulge source and X-ray burster SLX 1735-269. The power spectrum as observed
with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer is characterized by a strong band-limited
noise component which is approximately flat below a 0.1-2.3 Hz break frequency;
above this frequency the power spectrum declines as a power law of index 0.9.
At the highest observed count rate a broad bump is superimposed on this
band-limited noise. The power spectrum is very similar to that of other
low-luminosity neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) and to black-hole
candidates when these types of source accrete at their lowest observed mass
accretion rates. However, we identify one unusual aspect of the X-ray
variability of SLX 1735-269: the break frequency increases when the inferred
mass accretion rate decreases. This is the opposite to what is normally
observed in other sources. The only source for which the same behavior has been
observed is the accretion-powered millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658. No
coherent millisecond pulsations were observed from SLX 1735-269 with an upper
limit on the amplitude of 2.2% rms. Observing this behavior in SLX 1735-269
increases the similarities between SAX J1808.4-3658 and the other neutron star
LMXBs for which so far no coherent pulsations have been observed. We expect
that other sources will show the same behavior when these sources are studied
in detail at their lowest mass accretion rates.

neutron-rich nuclei have been separated into their s-process and r-process
components. The production of s-process elements in thermally pulsing
asymptotic giant branch stars of low mass proceeds from the combined operation
of two neutron sources: the dominant reaction 13C(alpha,n)16O, which releases
neutrons in radiative conditions during the interpulse phase, and the reaction
22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg, marginally activated during thermal instabilities. The
resulting s-process distribution is strongly dependent on the stellar
metallicity. For the standard model discussed in this paper, it shows a sharp
production of the Ba-peak elements around Z = Z_sun/4. Concerning the r-process
yields, we assume that the production of r-nuclei is a primary process
occurring in stars near the lowest mass limit for Type II supernova
progenitors. The r-contribution to each nucleus is computed as the difference
between its solar abundance and its s-contribution given by the Galactic
chemical evolution model at the epoch of the solar system formation. We compare
our results with spectroscopic abundances of elements from Ba to Eu at various
metallicities (mainly from F and G stars) showing that the observed trends can
be understood in the light of the present knowledge of neutron capture
nucleosynthesis. Finally, we discuss a number of emerging features that deserve

well. The effective electron-wall interaction is derived by use of a local
gauge transformation in the spin space. This interaction is treated
perturbatively to the second order. The conductivity contribution within the
classical (Boltzmann) transport theory turns out to be negligiblly small in
bulk magnets, due to a large thickness of the wall compared with the fermi
wavelength. It can be, however, significant in ballistic nanocontacts, as
indicated in recent experiments. We also discuss the quantum correction in
disordered case where the quantum coherence among electrons becomes important.
In such case of weak localization the wall can contribute to a decrease of
resistivity by causing dephasing. At lower temperature this effect grows and
can win over the classical contribution, in particular in wire of diameter
$L_{\perp}\lesssim \ell_{\phi}$, $\ell_{\phi}$ being the inelastic diffusion
length. Conductance change of the quantum origin caused by the motion of the

Bohr-Sommerfeld form. They arise from bilinear (Wronskian) functional relations
pairing spectral determinants of (N+2) generically distinct operators, all the
transforms of one quantum Hamiltonian under a cyclic group of complex scalings.
The determinants' zeros define (N+2) semi-infinite chains of points in the
complex spectral plane, and they encode the original quantum problem. Each
chain can now be described by an exact quantization condition which constrains
it in terms of its neighbors, resulting in closed equilibrium conditions for
the global chain system; these are supplemented by the standard
(Bohr-Sommerfeld) quantization conditions, which bind the infinite tail of each
chain asymptotically. This reduced problem is then probed numerically for
effective solvability upon test cases (mostly, symmetric quartic oscillators):
we find that the iterative enforcement of all the quantization conditions
generates discrete chain dynamics which appear to converge geometrically
towards the correct eigenvalues/eigenfunctions. We conjecture that the exact
quantization then acts by specifying reduced chain dynamics which can be stable
(contractive) and thus determine the exact quantum data as their fixed point.

transverse to each other and to F, which bind every leaf of F. This pair of
laminations can be blown down to give a transverse regulating pseudo-Anosov
flow for F, analogous to Thurston's structure theorem for surface bundles over
a circle with pseudo-Anosov monodromy.
  A corollary of the existence of this structure is that the underlying
manifold M is homotopy rigid in the sense that a self-homeomorphism homotopic
to the identity is isotopic to the identity. Furthermore, the product
structures at infinity are rigid under deformations of the foliation F through
R-covered foliations, in the sense that the representations of pi_1(M) in
Homeo((S^1_univ)_t) are all conjugate for a family parameterized by t. Another
corollary is that the ambient manifold has word-hyperbolic fundamental group.
  Finally we speculate on connections between these results and a program to
prove the geometrization conjecture for tautly foliated 3-manifolds.

(STIRAP) in which the single intermediate state is replaced by $N$ intermediate
states. Each of these states is connected to the initial state $\state{i}$ with
a coupling proportional to the pump pulse and to the final state $\state{f}$
with a coupling proportional to the Stokes pulse, thus forming a parallel
multi-$\Lambda$ system. It is shown that the dark (trapped) state exists only
when the ratio between each pump coupling and the respective Stokes coupling is
the same for all intermediate states. We derive the conditions for existence of
a more general adiabatic-transfer state which includes transient contributions
from the intermediate states but still transfers the population from state
$\state{i}$ to state $\state{f}$ in the adiabatic limit. We present various
numerical examples for success and failure of multi-$\Lambda$ STIRAP which
illustrate the analytic predictions. Our results suggest that in the general
case of arbitrary couplings, it is most appropriate to tune the pump and Stokes
lasers either just below or just above all intermediate states.
