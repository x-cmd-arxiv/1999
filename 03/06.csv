gamma-rays, reveal two pronounced components, both produced by radiation by
energetic particles. One peaks in the IR - to soft X-ray band, radiating via
the synchrotron process; the other, peaking in the high-energy gamma-rays, is
produced by the Compton process. These spectra -- and, in particular, the \asca
data -- suggest that the origin of the seed photons for Comptonization is
diverse. In the High-energy peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs), the dominant seed
photons for Comptonization appear to be the synchrotron photons internal to the
jet (SSC process). In the quasar-hosted blazars (QHBs), on the other hand, the
X-ray band emission is still dominated by the SSC process, while the MeV to GeV
range is produced by Comptonization of external photons such as the emission
line light. In the context of this three-component model, we derive the
magnetic field of 0.1 - 1 Gauss for all classes of blazars. Lorentz factors
gamma_{peak} of electrons radiating at each peak of the nuFnu spectra are
estimated to be ~10^{5}$ for HBLs; this is much higher than ~10^{3}$ for QHBs.
This difference is consistent with the fact that the four sources that are
known to emit TeV gamma-rays (TeV blazars) are all classified as HBLs. Among
the TeV blazars, Mkn 421 is one of the brightest and most variable emitters
from ultraviolet (eV) to hard gamma-ray (TeV) energies.The multi-frequency
observations including TeV energy band provide the best opportunity to
understand high-energy emission from blazar jets. In this paper, we discuss
results of multi-frequency analysis and review the results of intensive
campaigns for Mkn 421 from 1994 to 1998

another beyond it, is presented. Inside the Solar Circle, in addition to the
two known field reversals in or near the Carina-Sagittartus arm and the

general renormalization-group arguments based on the renormalizability of the

scaling due to a finite lattice constant and a finite cutoff. For a confined

concept which plays a central role in combinatorial group theory
(Lyndon-Schuppe:1977). The focus here is on the geometric intuitions and on
relating group-theoretical diagrams to the traditional charts associated with
context-free grammars and type-0 rewriting systems. The paper is structured as
follows. We begin in Section 1 by analyzing charts in terms of constructs
called cells, which are a geometrical counterpart to rules. Then we move in
Section 2 to a presentation of cancellation diagrams and show how they can be
used computationally. In Section 3 we give a formal algebraic presentation of
the concept of group computation structure, which is based on the standard
notions of free group and conjugacy. We then relate in Section 4 the geometric
and the algebraic views of computation by using the fundamental theorem of
combinatorial group theory (Rotman:1994). In Section 5 we study in more detail
the relationship between the two views on the basis of a simple grammar stated
as a group computation structure. In section 6 we extend this grammar to handle
non-local constructs such as relative pronouns and quantifiers. We conclude in
Section 7 with some brief notes on the differences between normal submonoids
and normal subgroups, group computation versus rewriting systems, and the use
of group morphisms to study the computational complexity of parsing and
generation.

presents an empirical evaluation of TOOT, an adaptable spoken dialogue system

models of Standard Model gauge group in the framework of non-simply-connected
elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau, without section but with a bi-section. The
fibrations on a cover Calabi-Yau, where the model has 6 generations of SU(5)
and the bundle is given via the spectral cover description, use a different
description of the elliptic fibre which leads to more than one global section.
We present two examples of a possible cover Calabi-Yau with a free involution:
one is a fibre product of rational elliptic surfaces $dP_9$; another example is
an elliptic fibration over a Hirzebruch surface. There we give the necessary
amount of chiral matter by turning on in the bundles a further parameter,
related to singularities of the fibration and the branching of the spectral
cover.

as a quotient of a free $K$-algebra are combined with the polynomials defining

avoiding the complication of computing in $A$. The paper concludes by showing
how the results can be applied to completable presentations of semigroups and
so enable calculations of Green's relations.

two-body correlations from one part, and of correlations between multiplicity

to some approximations whose validity and relation to more refined descriptions

us to diagonalize exactly the dissipative Hamiltonians that are frequently
adopted in the literature. Using this method we derive the conditions of
validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and show how this approximate
description relates to more general ones. We also show that the existence of
dissipative coherent states is intimately related to the RWA. Finally, through
the evaluation of the dynamics of the damped oscillator, we notice an important
property of the dissipative model that has not been properly accounted for in
previous works; namely, the necessity of new constraints to the application of
the factorizable initial conditions.
