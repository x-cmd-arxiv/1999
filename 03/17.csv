  Journal Letters",,"10.1086/312020",,"astro-ph",,"  Based on an ultra deep (230 ks) ROSAT HRI imaging of M101, we have detected 5
X-ray sources that coincide spatially with optical emission line features
previously classified as supernova remnants in this nearby galaxy. Two of these
coincidences (SNR MF83 and NGC5471B) most likely represent the true physical
association of X-ray emission with shock-heated interstellar gas. MF83, with a
radius of ~ 134 pc, is one of the largest remnants known. NGC5471B, with a
radius of 30 pc and a velocity of at least 350 km/s (FWZI), is extremely bright
in both radio and optical. The X-ray luminosities of these two shell-like
remnants are $\sim 1$ and $3 \times 10^{38} ergs/s$ (0.5-2 keV), about an order
of magnitude brighter than the brightest supernova remnants known in our Galaxy
and in the Magellanic Clouds. The inferred blastwave energy is $\sim 3 \times
10^{52} ergs$ for NGC5471B and $\sim 3 \times 10^{53}$ ergs for MF83.
Therefore, the remnants likely originate in hypernovae, which are a factor of
$\gtrsim 10$ more energetic than canonical supernovae and are postulated as
being responsible for Gamma-ray bursts observed at cosmological distances. The
study of such hypernova remnants in nearby galaxies has the potential to
provide important constraints on the progenitor type, rate, energetics, and
beaming effect of Gamma-ray bursts.

gamma-ray emission was detected; its afterglow has been followed by an
extensive set of radio, optical and X-ray observations. We have studied the
gamma-ray burst itself as observed by the CGRO detectors. We find that
gamma-ray fluxes are not correlated with the simultaneous optical observations,
and the gamma-ray spectra cannot be extrapolated simply to the optical fluxes.
The burst is well fit by the standard four-parameter GRB function, with the
exception that excess emission compared to this function is observed below ~15
keV during some time intervals. The burst is characterized by the typical
hard-to-soft and hardness-intensity correlation spectral evolution patterns.
The energy of the peak of the nu f_nu spectrum, E_p, reaches an unusually high
value during the first intensity spike, 1470 +/- 110 keV, and then falls to
\~300 keV during the tail of the burst. The high-energy spectrum above ~MeV is
consistent with a power law with a photon index of about -3. By fluence, GRB
990123 is brighter than all but 0.4% of the GRBs observed with BATSE, clearly
placing it on the -3/2 power-law portion of the intensity distribution.
However, the redshift measured for the afterglow is inconsistent with the
Euclidean interpretation of the -3/2 power-law. Using the redshift value of >=
1.61 and assuming isotropic emission, the gamma-ray fluence exceeds 10E54 ergs.

(MHD) evolution of coronal loops. For these simulations we assume that the
loops carry no net current, as might be expected if the loop had evolved due to
vortex flows. Furthermore the initial equilibrium is taken to be a cylindrical
flux tube with line-tied ends. For a given amount of twist in the magnetic
field it is well known that once such a loop exceeds a critical length it
becomes unstableto ideal MHD instabilities. The early evolution of these
instabilities generates large current concentrations. Firstly we show that
these current concentrations are consistent with the formation of a current
sheet. Magnetic reconnection can only occur in the vicinity of these current
concentrations and we therefore couple the resistivity to the local current
density. This has the advantage of avoiding resistive diffusion in regions
where it should be negligible. We demonstrate the importance of this procedure
by comparison with simulations based on a uniform resistivity. From our
numerical experiments we are able to estimate some observational signatures for
unstable coronal loops. These signatures include: the timescale of the loop
brightening; the temperature increase; the energy released and the predicted
observable flow speeds. Finally we discuss to what extent these observational
signatures are consistent with the properties of transient brightening loops.

neutron stars. Our approach uses the weak-scale hidden sector models in which
the Higgs sector of the standard model is extended to include a gauge singlet
that only interacts with the Higgs particle. These particles would be produced
either during the implosion of the red supergiant star core or at the aftermath
of a neutron star binary merger. The whole energetics and timescales of the
relativistic blast wave, the fireball, are reproduced.

Josephson's relation for a charged superfluid. This proof is obtained as a
consequence of an exact renormalization group equation for the photon mass. We
obtain Josephson's relation directly in the form $\rho_{s}\sim t^{\nu}$, that

give an interpretation of a recent experiment performed in thin films of

behavior of the penetration depth exponent $\nu'$ is possibly associated with a
non-trivial critical behavior and we predict the exponents $\nu=1$ and
$\alpha=-1$ for the correlation lenght and specific heat, respectively. In the

$m_{h,0}^2\sim t^{\zeta}$, where $m_{h,0}$ is the bare mass of the magnetic

a critical regime with $\nu'=\nu\approx 2/3$ is having $\zeta\approx 4/3$, that

Fermi energy comparable to the well bottom bending amplitude. This plateau
exists in one of two metastable states of the sample, for which a symmetric
quasi-double-quantum-well system is formed inside the Ge layer, and corresponds
to the filling factor nu = 1 for each of two sublayers in the Ge layer. The
plateau exists not only within a magnetic field range related to the
quantum-Hall liquid, but extends beyond it into a so-called quantized Hall
insulator phase. For the other metastable state only a weak plateau is observed
in the Hall resistivity, corresponding to nu = 1 per Ge layer as a whole.
According to the existing theories, the extra wide plateau may be indicative of
a kind of disorder in a conducting layer, characterized by a uniform
distribution of puddles in their carrier density and by their small average
size. We attribute the differences between these two states to the existence of
two metastable modes in the self consistent potential profile that settle

  We construct a mathematical model of discrete problems as independence
systems with weighted elements. We introduce two auxiliary sets that
characterize the solution of the problem: the adjoint set, which contains the
elements from the original set none of which can be adjoined to the already
chosen solution elements; and the residual set, in which every element can be
adjoined to previously chosen solution elements.
  In a problem without lookahead, every adjoint set can be generated by the
solution algorithm effectively, in polynomial time.
  The main result of the study is the assertion that the NP class is identical
with the class of problems without lookahead. Hence it follows that if we fail
to find an effective (polynomial-time) solution algorithm for a given problem,
then we need to look for an alternative formulation of the problem in set of
problems without lookahead.

within dimensional regularization needs a consistent definition of gamma5. Also
loop calculations in supersymmetric theories need a consistent definition of
gamma5. In this paper we develop a new formalism, which allows us to define
consistent regularization schemes. We use Grothendieck's K-functor to construct
finite-dimensional vectorspaces of non-integer rank. The rank will play the
role of the ``4-2eps'' in conventional dimensional regularization. We then
define two regularization schemes, one similar to the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme,
the other one as a scheme, where all algebra is performed in four dimensions.
Lorentz invariance is maintained in both cases. However the structure of the
Clifford algebra cannot be preserved. We show that the HV-like scheme and the
four-dimensional scheme correspond to two different deformations of the
Clifford algebra. It is the purpose of this paper to advocate the
four-dimensional scheme for future calculations, since it is easier to use. As
a consistency check we performed explicit one-loop calculations of various
triangle anomalies in both schemes and we found agreement with Bardeen's
results.

dies out in finite time. The goal of this article is to show that with some
additional work, one can prove finite time die-out for two types of systems of
stochastic differential equations on the lattice Z^d. Our first system involves
the heat equation on the lattice Z^d, with a nonlinear noise term u(t,x)^gamma
dB_x(t), with 1/2 <= gamma < 1. The B_x are independent Brownian motions. When
gamma = 1/2, the measure which puts mass u(t,x) at x is a super-random walk and
it is well-known that the process becomes extinct in finite time a.s.
Finite-time extinction is known to be a.s. false if gamma = 1. For 1/2 < gamma
< 1, we show finite-time die-out by breaking up the solution into pieces, and
showing that each piece dies in finite time. Our second example involves the
mutually catalytic branching system of stochastic differential equations on
Z^d, which was first studied by Dawson and Perkins. Roughly speaking, this
process consists of 2 superprocesses with the continuous time simple random
walk as the underlying spatial motion. Furthermore, each process stimulates
branching and dying in the other process. By using a somewhat different
argument, we show that, depending on the initial conditions, finite time

are considered in the framework of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory as developed
previously by us. We consider the issue of fixed point resolution in the
diagonal coset of type A, and show how to decompose reducible representations
into irreducibles. We show the corresponding coset CFT gives rise to a unitary
tensor modular category in the sense of Turaev, and therefore may be used to
construct 3-manifold invariants. We also show that Kac-Wakimoto Hypothesis
(KWH) and Kac-Wakimoto Conjecture (KWC) are equivalent under general conditions
which can be checked in examples, a result which seems to be hard to prove by
purely representation considerations. Examples are also presented.

characteristic admits local uniformization in a finite extension F' of F. We
show that F'|F can be chosen to be normal. If K is perfect and P is of rank 1,
then alternatively, F' can be obtained from F by at most two Galois extensions;
if in addition P is zero-dimensional, then we only need one Galois extension.
Certain rational places of rank 1 can be uniformized already on F. We introduce
the notion of ""relative uniformization"" for arbitrary finitely generated
extensions of valued fields. Our proofs are based solely on valuation
theoretical theorems, which are of fundamental importance in positive
characteristic.

say that the pair (X,Y) has the Daugavet property if for every rank one bounded
linear operator T from X to Y the following equality \|J+T\|=1+\|T\| holds. A
new characterization of the Daugavet property in terms of weak open sets is
given. It is shown that the operators not fixing copies of l_1 on a Daugavet
pair satisfy the Daugavet equation.
  Some hereditary properties are found: if X is a Daugavet space and Y is its
subspace, then Y is also a Daugavet space provided X/Y has the Radon-Nikodym
property; if Y is reflexive, then X/Y is a Daugavet space. Becides, we prove
that if (X,Y) has the Daugavet property and Y \subset Z, then Z can be renormed
so that (X,Z) possesses the Daugavet property and the equivalent norm coincides
with the original one on Y.
