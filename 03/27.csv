reionization of the universe. In combination with a previous study of galaxies
and Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds, we are able to provide a unified description of
structure formation, verified against a large variety of observations. We also
take into account the clumping of the baryonic gas in addition to the presence
of collapsed objects. We consider two cosmologies: a critical universe with a
CDM power-spectrum and an open universe with $\Omega_0=0.3$, $\Lambda=0$. The
derived quasar luminosity function agrees reasonably well with observations at
$z<4.5$ and with constraints over larger redshifts from the HDF. The radiation
produced by these objects at $z \sim 16$ slowly reheats the universe which gets
suddenly reionized at $z_{ri}=6.8$ for the open universe ($z_{ri}=5.6$ for the
critical density universe). The UV background radiation simultaneously
increases sharply to reach a maximum of $J_{21} = 0.18$ at $z=2.6$, but shows
strong ionization edges until $z \leq 1$. The metallicity of the gas increases
quickly at high $z$ and is already larger than $0.01 Z_{\odot}$ at $z=10$. The
QSO number counts and the helium opacity constrain the reionization redshift to
be $z_{ri} \sim 6$. We confirm that a population of faint quasars is needed in
order to satisfy the observations. Due to the low reionization redshift, the
damping of CMB fluctuations is quite small, but future observations (e.g. with
the NGST) of the multiplicity functions of radiation sources and of the HI and
HeII opacities will strongly constrain scenarios in which reionization is due
to QSOs.

pressure and rotation. In this regime, pressure and gravity exchange roles as
drivers and inhibitors of spiral wave structures. Other instabilities that are
enhanced by pressure are also found in the general dispersion relation by
including higher order terms in the small parameter 1/kr for wavenumber k and

resolution to resolve the structure in the molecular streaming motions is
obtained. Our data support the presence of galactic shocks in the arms of M51.
In general, velocity gradients across arms are higher by a factor of 2-10 than
previously found. They vary in steepness along the spiral arms, becoming
particularly steep in between GMAs. The steep gradients cause conditions of
strong reverse shear in several regions in the arms, and thus the notion that
shear is generally reduced by streaming motions in spiral arms will have to be
modified. Of the three GMAs studied on the SW arm, only one shows reduced
shear. We find an expansion in the NE molecular arm at 25'' radius SE of the

largely independent of the unknown equation of state. We further derive a
semi-analytical upper bound on the neutron-star moment of inertia without
making any assumptions about the equation of state of matter at any density. We
use this upper bound to show that the maximum possible nodal precession
frequency of an inclined circular orbit around a slowly spinning neutron star
is nu_{NP}~45.2 (nu_s/300Hz) Hz, where nu_s is the spin frequency of the

inferred spin frequencies or the identification of the highest-frequency QPO
with that of a circular Keplerian orbit in the accretion disk.

the significant Galactic reddening in this direction. The optical and X-ray

places a severe strain on the simplest afterglow models involving spherical

200 kpc and beyond is controversial; results at this radius are
model-dependent. Observationally, the geometrical form of the dark halo can be
characterized by the equatorial axis ratio b/a (ovalness) and
vertical-to-equatorial axis ratio c/a (flattening) of the total density.
Different techniques consistently yield b/a > 0.7 (and thus b/a > 0.9 for the
potential) at R~20 kpc, with more axisymmetric values, b/a >~ 0.8, being more
likely. Results are less consistent for the vertical flattening, perhaps due to
the difference in the spatial regions probed by different techniques or
inappropriate assumptions. Techniques that probe furthest from the stellar

matter, we support our model-independent arguments with a quantitative analysis
of a model which uses a four-fermion interaction abstracted from single-gluon

a color-flavor locked state which leaves a global vector-like SU(2)_{color+L+R}

sufficiently dense quark matter. As the density is reduced, for sufficiently
large m_s we observe a first order transition from the color-flavor locked

this unlocking transition chiral symmetry is restored. For realistic values of
m_s our analysis indicates that chiral symmetry breaking may be present for all
densities down to those characteristic of baryonic matter. This supports the
idea that quark matter and baryonic matter may be continuously connected in
nature. We map the gaps at the quark Fermi surfaces in the high density

eliminate the need of ``background subtraction'' in calculating the action, we
apply this technique to study examples where the appropriate background was
ambiguous or unknown: topological black holes, Taub-NUT-AdS and Taub-Bolt-AdS.
We also identify certain cases where the covariant counterterms fail to render
the action finite, and we comment on the dual field theory interpretation of
this result. In some examples, the case of vanishing cosmological constant may
be recovered in a limit, which allows us to check results and resolve
ambiguities in certain asymptotically flat spacetime computations in the

  Part I","36 pages, uses plain TeX, added: new Section 6 (First Applications),
  several figures, and several new statements, made: minor improvements",,,,"math.RT math.CO physics.chem-ph",,"  The aim of this paper is to present a generalization of Lunn-Senior's
mathematical model of isomerism in organic chemistry. The main idea of Lunn and
Senior is that if the type of isomerism is fixed, a molecule with a fixed
skeleton and d univalent substituents has a symmetry group $W\leq S_d$ which is
generally not the molecule's 3-dimensional symmetry group. The unit character
of W induces a representation of the symmetric group $S_d$ which governs the
combinatorics of the isomers of the given molecule. Lunn-Senior's thesis is
that certain non-negative integers established by this representation are upper
boundaries of the corresponding numbers, yielded by the experiment (and often
coincide with them). Moreover, the authors define (in a particular case) a
partial order among the objects of the model, such that some simple
substitution reactions correspond to inequalities. These two groups of data
determine the group W, and produce so called ""type properties"" of the molecule
(properties which do not depend on the nature of the univalent substituents).
Our hypothesis is that if we replace the unit character of $W$ by any
one-dimensional character of $W$ (thus we count only a part of the isomers -
those having a maximum property), we also get a type property of the molecule.
An instance of that is the inventory of the stereoisomers called chiral pairs.
The formalism can be generalized naturally and produces some preliminary
chemical results. Especially the partial order is defined and studied in the
general case and indicates the possible genetic relations among the
corresponding molecules. An important result of E. Ruch which connects the
dominance order among partitions and the existence of chiral pairs is obtained
as a consequence of a more general statement.

characterization of band preserving projection operators on Dedekind complete

vector lattices. The central role in these descriptions is played by d-bases,
one of two principal tools utilized in our work [{\it Inverses of Disjointness

concept of a d-basis has been applied so far only to vector lattices with a
large amount of projection bands. The absence of the projection bands has been
the major obstacle for extending, otherwise very useful concept of d-bases, to
arbitrary vector lattices. In Section~4 we overcome this obstacle by finding a
new way to introduce d-independence in an arbitrary vector lattice. This allows
us to produce a new definition of a d-basis which is free of the existence of
projection bands. We illustrate this by proving several results devoted to
cardinality of d-bases. Theorems~4.13 and~4.15 are the main of them and they
assert that, under very general conditions, a vector lattice either has a

Submitted for publication",,,"MSRI 1999-020","solv-int nlin.SI",,"  The real, nonsingular elliptic solutions of the Korteweg-deVries equation are
studied through the time dynamics of their poles in the complex plane. The
dynamics of these poles is governed by a dynamical system with a constraint.
This constraint is shown to be solvable for any finite number of poles located
in the fundamental domain of the elliptic function, often in many different
ways. Special consideration is given to those elliptic solutions that have a
real nonsingular soliton limit.
