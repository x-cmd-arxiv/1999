cosmological model, we have performed between 1 and 3 simulations, for a total
of 160 simulations. This constitutes the largest database of cosmological
simulations ever assembled, and the largest cosmological parameter space ever
covered by such simulations. We are making this database available to the
astronomical community. We provide instructions for accessing the database and
for converting the data from computational units to physical units.
  The database includes Tilted Cold Dark Matter (TCDM) models, Tilted Open Cold
Dark Matter (TOCDM) models, and Tilted Lambda Cold Dark Matter (TLCDM) models.
(For several simulations, the primordial exponent n of the power spectrum is
near unity, hence these simulations can be considered as ""untilted."") The
simulations cover a 4-dimensional cosmological parameter phase space, the
parameters being the present density parameter Omega_0, cosmological constant
lambda_0, and Hubble constant H_0, and the rms density fluctuation sigma_8 at
scale 8/h Mpc. All simulations were performed using a P3M algorithm with 64^3
particles on a 128^3 mesh, in a cubic volume of comoving size 128 Mpc. Each
simulation starts at a redshift of 24, and is carried up to the present. More
simulations will be added to the database in the future.

1990-1998 are presented. The source lies at ~5\arcdeg from the Galactic Center
and was within the SIGMA field of view during the GRANAT surveys of this
region. The total exposure time of the Galactic Center was 11x10^6 s. The
regular SIGMA observations revealed strong variability of the source: the
40-150 keV flux varied at least by a factor of 8 on a time scale of a year,
between less than 13 mCrab and ~100-110 mCrab. The average flux was ~60 mCrab
in 1990-1998. The source's spectrum is well fitted by a power law with a photon
index \alpha ~1.86 in the energy range 40 to 150 keV and becomes steeper at
energies above ~100 keV. The radio and hard X-ray properties of GRS 1758-258
are similar to those of another Galactic Center source, 1E1740.7-2942. GRS
1758-258 and 1E1740.7-2942 are the two brightest hard X-ray sources in the
Galactic Center region. Both sources have radio jets, similar X-ray
luminosities (~10^37 erg/s), and spectra, and exhibit variations in the hard
X-ray flux on long times scales by a factor of ~10 or more . In contrast to
most of the known black hole candidates, which are X-ray transients, GRS
1758-258 and 1E1740.7-2942 were detected by SIGMA during most of the
observations in 1990-1998. Assuming that this behavior of the sources implies
the suppression of accretion-disk instability in the region of partial hydrogen
ionization through X-ray heating, we impose constraints on the mass of the
optical companion and on the orbital period of the binary system.

Alfven waves. The theory of polytropes is generalized to allow for the flow of
entropy in response to a perturbation, as expected for the entropy associated
with wave pressure. The equation of state of molecular clouds is ""soft"", so
that the properties of the clouds are generally governed by the conditions at
the surface. In general, the polytropes are not isentropic, and this permits
large density and pressure drops to occur between the center and the edge of
the polytropes, as is observed.
