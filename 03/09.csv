spatial variations of the kernel can be obtained with minimum computing time.
The CPU cost required with this new extension of the image subtraction method
is almost the same as for fitting constant kernel solution. The method is
demonstrated with a serie of Monte-Carlo images. Differential PSF variations
and differential rotation between the images are simulated. It is shown that
this new method is able to achieve an optimal results even in these difficult
cases. It is clear that the most frequents instrumental problems are
automatically corrected by the method. It is also demonstrated that the method
does not suffer problems with under-sampling of the images. To conclude the
method is applied to real images of crowded field. It is proved that much
larger sub-areas of the images can be used for the fit, while keeping the same
accuracy in the subtracted image. This result is especially important in case
of variables located in low density fields, like the Huchra lens. Many other
useful applications of the method are possible for major astrophysical
problems. For instance supernovas search should benefit the method, but other
applications like Cepheids surveys in other galaxies should also find some
advantage in using the method. Many other applications will certainly show-up,
since variability search is a major issue in astronomy.

cooling flows including the effects of accumulated cooled material. The opacity
of this cooled gas can reduce the overall X-ray luminosity of the cooling flow,
and values of Mdot based on these luminosities can underestimate the true value
by factors of ~2. We find that accumulated cooled material can produce emergent
surface brightness profiles much like those observed even for nearly
homogeneous gas distributions. Consequently, much more of the gas may be
cooling below X-ray emitting temperatures in the central regions of cooling
flows (r < 10 kpc) than one would infer from observed X-ray surface brightness
profiles assuming the gas was optically thin. Similarly, the central densities
and pressures in cooling flows may have been underestimated. We show that
distributed absorption in cooling flows produces a number of observable effects
in the spectrum which may allow it to be differentiated from absorption due to
gas in our Galaxy. These include a characteristic suppression of the continuum
below ~2 keV, absorption features such as a redshifted O K-edge, and diminished
intensity of resonance emission lines. Spectra including the effects of
intrinsic absorption are not well fit by foreground absorbing models.
Attempting to fit such models to the spatially resolved spectra can lead to
underestimates of the true absorbing column by factors of 3-20. Fits to
integrated spectra of the entire cooling flow region can either underestimate
or overestimate the mass of the absorbing gas depending on the specifics of the
model. We discuss the potential detection of these effects with AXAF, XMM, and

determining analytically a lower limit of the anisotropy radius as a function

presented, together with the solution of the Jeans equations and the quantities
entering the scalar virial theorem. It is proved that a globally isotropic
gamma=1 component is consistent for any mass and core radius of the
superimposed gamma=0 model; on the contrary, only a maximum value of the core
radius is allowed for the gamma=0 model when a gamma=1 density distribution is
added. The combined effects of mass concentration and orbital anisotropy are
investigated, and an interesting behavior of the distribution function of the

with the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of the Schwinger - Dyson
equations for the correlation functions, which we describe by a
closed-time-path master ($n = \infty PI$) effective action. When the hierarchy
is truncated, one obtains the ordinary closed-system of correlation functions
up to a certain order, and from the nPI effective action, a set of
time-reversal invariant equations of motion. But when the effect of the higher
order correlation functions is included (through e.g., causal factorization--
molecular chaos -- conditions, which we call 'slaving'), in the form of a
correlation noise, the dynamics of the lower order correlations shows
dissipative features, as familiar in the field-theory version of Boltzmann
equation. We show that fluctuation-dissipation relations exist for such
effectively open systems, and use them to show that such a stochastic term,
which explicitly introduces quantum fluctuations on the lower order correlation
functions, necessarily accompanies the dissipative term, thus leading to a
Boltzmann-Langevin equation which depicts both the dissipative and stochastic

non-commuting character when one introduces potentials both for the theory's

the ``doubled'' formalism for maximal supergravities, where a generalised
duality relation between original and dual field strengths replaces the
equations of motion. In the doubled formalism, the gauge transformations
generate a superalgebra, and the corresponding symmetries have accordingly been
called ``superdualities.'' The corresponding Noether charges form a
representation of the cohomology ring on the spacetime manifold. In this paper,
we show that the gauge symmetry superalgebra implies certain non-trivial
relations among the various p-brane tensions, which can straightforwardly be
read off from the superalgebra commutation relations. This provides an elegant
derivation of the brane-tension relations purely within a given theory, without
the need to make use of duality relations between different theories, such as
the type IIA/IIB T-duality, although the results are consistent with such
dualities. We present the complete set of brane-tension relations in M-theory,
in the type IIA and type IIB theories, and in all the lower-dimensional maximal
supergravities. We also construct a doubled formalism for massive type IIA
supergravity, and this enables us to obtain the brane-tension relations

threshold is directly solved without employing a partial wave decomposition. In
the simplest form it is a three-dimensional integral equation in four
variables. From its solution the scattering amplitude is obtained as function
of vector Jacobi momenta. Based on Malfliet-Tjon type potentials differential
and total cross sections are calculated. The numerical stability of the
algorithm is demonstrated and the properties of the scattering amplitude
discussed.

muon capture to include partial occupation of nuclear subshells in the

the work by Auerbach et al., that a partial occupation of the p1/2 subshell
reduces the inclusive cross sections only slightly. The extended model
describes the muon capture rate and the 12C(nu_e,e-)12N cross section very
well. The recently updated flux and the improved model bring the calculated
12C(nu_mu,mu^-)12N cross section (~ 17.5 10^{-40} cm^2) and the data (12.4 +/-
0.3(stat.) +/- 1.8(syst.) 10^{-40} cm^2) closer together, but does not remove

Ionospheric Stochastic Tomography software (GIST), and its powerful capability
for ingesting GPS data from different sources (ground stations, receivers on
board LEO for navigation and occultation purposes) and other data such as
altimetry data to yield global maps with dense coverage and inherent
calibration of the instruments. We show results obtained including 106 IGS
ground stations, GPS/MET low rate occultation data, TOPEX/POSEIDON GPS data
from the navigation antenna and NASA Radar Altimeter with the additional
benefit of a direct estimation of the NRA bias. The possibility of ingesting
different kinds of ionospheric data into the tomographic model suggest a way to
accurately monitor the ionosphere with direct application to single frequency
instrument calibration.

harmonic oscillator, and an accurate estimate of ground-state energy and
specific heat for a single-well quartic anharmonic oscillator. As QSM can be
regarded as finite temperature field theory at a point, we make use of Feynman
diagrams to illustrate the non-perturbative character of the series: it
contains all powers of $\hbar$ and graphs with any number of loops; the usual
perturbative series corresponds to a subset of the diagrams of the
semiclassical series. We comment on the application of our results to other
potentials, to correlation functions and to field theories in higher

The latter is a particular reduction of the 2d-Toda lattice. In particular,
they satisfy a KP-like equation, but with a right hand side, depending on
nearest neighbors. They also satisfy Virasoro constraints, which combined with
the KP-like equation lead to inductive equations for the probabilities.
