the recently demonstrated luminosity distribution in gamma-ray bursts: the
spectral evolution timescale of pulse structures is anticorrelated with peak
luminosity, and with quantities which might be expected to reflect the bulk

relationship in two important burst samples using the cross-correlation lags
between low (25-50 keV) and high (100-300 keV and > 300 keV) energy bands. For
a set of seven bursts (six with redshifts) observed by CGRO/BATSE and BeppoSAX
which also have optical or radio counterparts, the gamma/X peak flux ratios and
peak luminosities are anti-correlated with spectral lag. For the 174 brightest
BATSE bursts with durations longer than 2 s and significant emission above 300
keV, a similar anti-correlation is evident between gamma-ray hardness ratio or
peak flux, and spectral lag. For the six bursts with redshifts, the connection
between peak luminosity and spectral lag is well-fitted by a power-law. GRB
980425 (if associated with SN 1998bw) would appear to extend this trend
qualitatively, but with a lag of ~ 4-5 s and luminosity of ~ 1.3x10^47 ergs

previously by Band, most lags are concentrated on the short end of the lag

the nuclear magnetization vector precesses in grain body coordinates, resulting
in dissipation of energy. The analogous process involving electron spins was
discovered by Purcell and termed ``Barnett relaxation''. We revisit the physics
of the ``Barnett relaxation'' process and correct the estimate for the Barnett
relaxation rate. We show that nuclear relaxation can be orders of magnitude

1998, 454 days after outburst, with the STIS CCD camera onboard the Hubble

the presence of a galaxy which was obscured in earlier (June 1997) HST images
by emission from the optical transient (OT). The galaxy is regular in shape:
after correcting for the HST/STIS PSF, it is well-fitted by an exponential disk
with a scale length of 0.""046 +/- 0.""006 and an ellipticity of 0.70 +/- 0.07.
All observations are marginally consistent with a continuous decline in OT
emission as t^{-1.3} beginning two days after outburst; however, we find no
direct evidence in the image for emission from the OT, and the surface
brightness profile of the galaxy is most regular if we assume that the OT
emission is negligible, suggesting that the OT may have faded more rapidly at
late times than is predicted by the power-law decay. Due to the wide bandwidth
of the STIS clear mode, the estimated magnitude of the galaxy is dependent on
the galaxy spectrum that is assumed. Using colors obtained from late-time
ground-based observations to constrain the spectrum, we find V = 25.4 +/- 0.15,
a few tenths of a magnitude brighter than earlier ground-based estimates that
were obtained by observing the total light of the galaxy and the OT and then
subtracting the estimated OT brightness assuming it fades as a single
power-law. This again suggests that the OT may have faded faster at late time
than the power-law predicts. The position of the OT agrees with that of the
isophotal center of the galaxy to 0.""01. This remarkable agreement raises the
possibility that the GRB may have been associated with either an active
galactic nucleus or a nuclear starburst.

where $N$ is the number of sheets and $t_c$ is the crossing time. It has been
claimed that the system does not reach the thermal equilibrium in this thermal
relaxation timescale, and that it takes much longer time for the system to
reach true thermal equilibrium.
  We demonstrate that this behavior is explained simply by the fact that the
relaxation time is long. The relaxation time of sheets with average binding
energy is $\sim 20 Nt_c$, and that of sheets with high energy can exceed $1000
Nt_c$. Thus, one needs to take the average over the relaxation timescale of
high-energy sheets, if one wants to look at the thermal characteristic of these
high energy sheets.

the non-equilibrium fluctuations of the electron density in the N-layer cause
the fluctuations of the phase of the order parameter in the S-layer. As a
result, the density of states in the superconductor deviates from the BCS form,
most notably the density of states in the gap becomes finite. This effect can
be viewed as a result of the time reversal symmetry breaking due to the
non-equilibrium, and can be described in terms of a low energy collective mode
of the junction, which couples normal currents in N-layer and supercurrents.
This mode is analogous to the Schmid-Sch\""{o}n mode. To interpret their
measurements of the tunneling current, Pothier {\em et. al} [Phys. Rev. Lett.

density of states in the S-layer manifest itself similarly to the broadening of
the distribution function. Mechanism suggested here can be a possible
explanation of this experimental puzzle. We also propose an independent

addresses the consequences of conifold histories in gravitational functional
integrals that also include scalar fields. This study will be carried out
explicitly for the generalized Hartle-Hawking initial state, that is the
Hartle-Hawking initial state generalized to a sum over conifolds. In the
perturbative limit of the semiclassical approximation to the generalized
Hartle-Hawking state, one finds that quantum field theory on Einstein conifolds
is recovered. In particular, the quantum field theory of a scalar field on de
Sitter spacetime with $RP^3$ spatial topology is derived from the generalized
Hartle-Hawking initial state in this approximation. This derivation is carried
out for a scalar field of arbitrary mass and scalar curvature coupling.
Additionally, the generalized Hartle-Hawking boundary condition produces a
state that is not identical to but corresponds to the Bunch-Davies vacuum on
$RP^3$ de Sitter spacetime. This result cannot be obtained from the original
Hartle-Hawking state formulated as a sum over manifolds as there is no Einstein
manifold with round $RP^3$ boundary.

In such models the inflaton field does not oscillate after inflation, and its
effective mass becomes vanishingly small, so the standard theory of reheating
based on the decay of the oscillating inflaton field does not apply. For a long
time the only mechanism of reheating in such non-oscillatory (NO) models was
based on gravitational particle production in an expanding universe. This
mechanism is very inefficient. We will show that it may lead to cosmological
problems associated with large isocurvature fluctuations and overproduction of
dangerous relics such as gravitinos and moduli fields. We also note that the
setting of initial conditions for the stage of reheating in these models should
be reconsidered. All of these problems can be resolved in the context of the
recently proposed scenario of instant preheating if there exists an interaction
${g^2} \phi^2\chi^2$ of the inflaton field $\phi$ with another scalar field
$\chi$. We show that the mechanism of instant preheating in NO models is much
more efficient than the usual mechanism of gravitational particle production
even if the coupling constant $g^2$ is extremely small, $10^{-14} \ll g^2 \ll
1$.

are given by the conjugate momentum to the zero-modes. The conjugate momentum
is quantized for the sinh-Gordon, the Bullough-Dodd, and the super sinh-Gordon
models where the quantization conditions depend on the size $R$ of the system
and the reflection amplitudes. The other method is to solve the standard
thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations for the integrable models in a
perturbative series of $1/(const. - \ln R)$. The constant factor which is not
fixed in the lowest order computations can be identified {\it only when} we
compare the higher order corrections with the quantization conditions.
Numerical TBA analysis shows a perfect match for the scaling functions obtained
by the first method. Our results show that these two methods are complementary
to each other. While the reflection amplitudes are confirmed by the numerical
TBA analysis, the analytic structures of the TBA equations become clear only

the number of topologically distinct holomorphic functions on the 2-sphere that
preserve a given number of elementary branch point singularities. In this case
the monodromy group is the alternating group, and this is another case that, in
principle, is of considerable interest.
  We conjecture an explicit form, for arbitrary k, for the generating series
for $c_k(\alpha)$, and prove that it holds for factorisations of permutations
with one, two and three cycles ($\alpha$ is a partition with at most three
parts). The generating series is naturally expressed in terms of the symmetric
functions dual to those introduced by Macdonald for the ``top'' connection

tiny perturbation of the motion of a free-falling particle near a massive

1918 using general relativity. The Lense-Thirring effect can also be thought of
as the 'dragging of inertial frames', as first named by Einstein himself. The
amount of frame dragging varies with height above the spinning earth.
Einstein's general relativity predicts the value of this effect near the earth,
but the effect has not yet been accurately verified experimentally. However,
recent work using the LAGEOS series, earth orbiting satellites has rendered an
unconfirmed experimental value that agrees with theory to an accuracy of about
20 %. Our physical model is based on the disturbance of the electrically
charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum in a state of free-fall near a
massive spinning object. We calculate the Lense-Thirring effect on the earth's

"quant-ph/9903057","Seth Lloyd","Seth Lloyd","Quantum search without entanglement","9 pages, TeX, submitted to Physical Review Letters",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.61.010301",,"quant-ph",,"  Entanglement of quantum variables is usually thought to be a prerequisite for
obtaining quantum speed-ups of information processing tasks such as searching
databases. This paper presents methods for quantum search that give a speed-up
over classical methods, but that do not require entanglement. These methods
rely instead on interference to provide a speed-up. Search without entanglement
comes at a cost: although they outperform analogous classical devices, the
quantum devices that perform the search are not universal quantum computers and
require exponentially greater overhead than a quantum computer that operates
using entanglement. Quantum search without entanglement is compared to
classical search using waves.

the radiation field by repeated application of the photon creation operator on
binomial states and negative binomial states. They reduce to Fock states and
excited coherent states in certain limits and can be viewed as intermediate
states between Fock states and coherent states. We find that both the excited
binomial states and excited negative binomial states can be exactly normalized
in terms of hypergeometric functions. Base on this interesting character, some
of the statistical properties are discussed.
