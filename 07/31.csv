Interferometer was used on the Canada-France-Hawaii 3.6-m telescope and the
University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope to derive the two-dimensional velocity
field of the line-emitting gas in the disks of the Sc galaxy NGC 3079 and the
Sb galaxy NGC 4388. In contrast to previous work based on long-slit data, the
detection of the bar potential from the Fabry-Perot data does not rely on the
existence of inner Lindblad resonances or strong bar-induced shocks. Simple
kinematic models which approximate the intrinsic gas orbits as nonintersecting,
inclined elliptical annuli that conserve angular momentum characterize the
observed velocity fields. Box-shaped bulges in both NGC 3079 and NGC 4388 are
confirmed using new near-infrared images to reduce dust obscuration.
Morphological analysis of starlight in these galaxies is combined with the gas
kinematics derived from the Fabry-Perot spectra to test evolutionary models of
stellar bars that involve transitory boxy bulges, and to quantify the
importance of such bars in fueling active nuclei. Our data support the
evolutionary bar models, but fail to prove convincingly that the stellar bars
in NGC 3079 and NGC 4388 directly trigger or sustain the nuclear activity.

find that large projected stellar tidal tails ~200 Kpc can develop during the

the binary.
  When gas is treated as test-particles, gaseous tidal tails may reach up to ~
1 Mpc in radius in a Hubble time; this radius is similar to the size of the
common dark halo formed during the interaction. It is suggested that gaseous
tails may provide a mean to determine to some extent the size of the common
dark halo formed during the merging of spirals.
  The stellar remnant shows an elliptical-like surface density profile, but its
phase-space retains more information that can be used to determine whether it

The effect of interaction on the pre-exponent $A_d(t)$ is important if one
calculates the interaction-dependent part of the weak localization correction

this correction in the first order due to the exact cancellation of the linear

separated by sharply defined, but curved, interfaces: the resulting Laplace
pressure drives fluid flow. Scaling ideas (of Siggia and of Furukawa) predict
that, ultimately, this flow should become turbulent as inertial effects
dominate over viscous ones. The physics here is complex: mesoscale simulation
methods (such as Lattice Boltzmann and Dissipative Particle Dynamics) can play
an essential role in its elucidation, as we describe. Likewise, it is a matter
of experience that immiscible fluids will mix, on some lengthscale at least, if
stirred vigorously enough. A scaling theory (of Doi and Ohta) predicts the
dependence of a steady state domain size on shear rate, but assumes low
Reynolds number (inertia is neglected). Our preliminary simulation results
(three-dimensional, so far only on small systems) show little sign of the kind
of steady state envisaged by Doi and Ohta; they raise instead the possibility
of an oriented domain texture which can continue to coarsen until either

  the Experimental Detection of Gravitomagnetism in the Terrestrial Laboratory","36 pages, 3 figures. This article does not reflect the position of
  any official instituion. The ideas exposed still evolving",,,,"gr-qc",,"  It is extraordinarely difficult to detect the extremely weak gravitomagnetic
(GM) field of even as large a body as the earth. To detect the GM field, the
gravitational analog of an ordinary magnetic field, in a modest terrestrial
laboratory should be that much more difficult. Here we show, however, that for
certain superconductor configuration and topologies, it should be possible to
detect a measurable GM field in the terrestrial laboratory, by using the
properties of superconductors imposed by quantum mechanical requirements. In
particular, we show that the GM Flux should be quantized in a superconductor
with non-vanishing genus, just like the ordinary magnetic flux. And this
magnetically induced, quantized GM Flux, for sufficiently high quantum number
and favorable geometries, should be distinguishable from the effects produced
by an ordinary magnetic field.

the distorted wave impulse approximation (DWIA). For this purpose, we present a
revised tree-level model of elementary kaon photoproduction that incorporates
hadronic form factors consistent with gauge invariance, uses SU(3) values for
the Born couplings and uses resonances consistent with multi-channel analyses.
The potential of exclusive quasifree kaon photoproduction on nuclei to reveal
details of the hyperon-nucleus interaction is examined. Detailed predictions
for the coincidence cross section, the photon asymmetry, and the hyperon
polarization and their sensitivities to the ingredients of the model are
obtained for all six production channels. Under selected kinematics these
observables are found to be sensitive to the hyperon-nucleus final state
interaction. Some polarization observables are found to be insensitive to
distortion effects, making them ideal tools to search for possible medium
modifications of the elementary amplitude.

the nucleon's Fadde'ev amplitude motivated by quark-diquark solutions of the
relativistic Fadde'ev equation. Only the scalar diquark is retained, and it and
the quark are confined. A good description of the data requires a nonpointlike
diquark correlation with an electromagnetic radius of 0.8 r_pi. The composite,
nonpointlike nature of the diquark is crucial. It provides for diquark-breakup
terms that are of greater importance than the diquark photon absorption
contribution.

in odd-odd N=Z nuclei are several MeV less bound than the even-even ground
states. We associate this difference with a pair gap and conclude that there is
no evidence for an isoscalar pairing condensate in N=Z nuclei.

in which polarization domain walls are modulationally unstable and the system

those that are factorable. This type of entanglement gives rise to a new kind
of postselection-induced Bell inequality violation. The significance of
counterfactual entanglement, and its physical implications, are assessed.

quantifiable property is presented. Three different measures for the
nonorthogonality of pure states are introduced, and one of these measures is
extended to single-particle density matrices using methods that are similar to
recently introduced techniques for quantifying entanglement. Several
interesting special cases are considered. It is pointed out that a measure of
nonorthogonality can meaningfully be associated with a single mixed quantum
state. It is then shown how nonorthogonality can be unlocked with classical
information; this analysis reveals interesting inequalities and points to a
number of connections between nonorthogonality and entanglement.

monodromy matrix with an infinite-dimensional auxiliary space. We present the
Q-operator as an explicit integral operator as well as describe its action on
the monomial basis. As a result we obtain a family of integral equations for
multivariable polynomial eigenfunctions of the quantum integrable DST model.
These eigenfunctions are special functions of the Heun class which is beyond
the hypergeometric class. The found integral equations are new and they shall
provide a basis for efficient analytical and numerical studies of such
