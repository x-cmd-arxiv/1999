  version","Astrophys.J. 529 (2000) 12","10.1086/308279",,"astro-ph",,"  Secondary CMB anisotropies and polarization provide a laboratory to study
structure formation in the reionized epoch. We consider the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect from mildly nonlinear large-scale structure and show
that it is a natural extension of the perturbative Vishniac effect. If the gas
traces the dark matter to overdensities of order 10, as expected from
simulations, this effect is at least comparable to the Vishniac effect at
arcminute scales. On smaller scales, it may be used to study the thermal
history-dependent clustering of the gas. Polarization is generated through
Thomson scattering of primordial quadrupole anisotropies, kinetic (second order
Doppler) quadrupole anisotropies and intrinsic scattering quadrupole
anisotropies. Small scale polarization results from the density and ionization
modulation of these sources. These effects generically produce comparable E and
B-parity polarization, but of negligible amplitude (0.001-0.01 uK) in adiabatic
CDM models. However, the primordial and kinetic quadrupoles are observationally
comparable today so that a null detection of B-polarization would set
constraints on the evolution and coherence of the velocity field. Conversely, a
detection of a cosmological B-polarization even at large angles does not
necessarily imply the presence of gravity waves or vorticity. For these
calculations, we develop an all-sky generalization of the Limber equation that
allows for an arbitrary local angular dependence of the source for both scalar
and symmetric trace-free tensor fields on the sky.

processes in the evolution of proto-cluster gas. We investigate this from two
directions: by finding the amount of `excess energy' required in intra-cluster
gas in order to reproduce the observed X-ray cluster properties, and by
studying the excess energies obtained from supernovae in a semi-analytic model
of galaxy formation. Using the insights obtained from the model, we then
critically discuss possible ways of achieving the high excess specific energies
required in clusters. These include heating by supernovae and active galactic
nuclei, the role of entropy, and the effect of removing gas through radiative
cooling.
  Our model self-consistently follows the production of excess energy as well
as its effect on star formation in galaxies. Excess energy is retained in gas
as gravitational, kinetic and/or thermal energy. The gas distribution of
virialized halos are modelled with a 2-parameter family of gas density
profiles; gas profiles are then chosen according to the total energy of the
gas. We investigate four contrasting ways of modifying gas density profiles in
the presence of excess energy, in order to study the sensitivity of results to
the model. In addition, we estimate the minimum excess specific energy required
when all available gas profiles are considered, using a fiducial cluster with a
temperature of around 2 keV. We find that the excess specific energies required
in clusters lie roughly in the range 1--3 keV/particle. (abridged)

energy ($\ga 1 $keV) X-rays by $\sim$10--30 ks. This is contrary to popular
models which attribute the correlated variability of the EUV, UV and optical

correlations of energy levels and eigenfunction amplitudes in diffusive
mesoscopic samples. Various spatial geometries are considered, with emphasis on
low-dimensional (quasi-1D and 2D) systems. Calculations are based on the
supermatrix sigma-model approach. The method reproduces, in so-called zero-mode
approximation, the universal random matrix theory (RMT) results for the
energy-level and eigenfunction fluctuations. Going beyond this approximation
allows us to study system-specific deviations from universality, which are
determined by the diffusive classical dynamics in the system. These deviations
are especially strong in the far ``tails'' of the distribution function of the
eigenfunction amplitudes (as well as of some related quantities, such as local
density of states, relaxation time, etc.). These asymptotic ``tails'' are
governed by anomalously localized states which are formed in rare realizations
of the random potential. The deviations of the level and eigenfunction
statistics from their RMT form strengthen with increasing disorder and become
especially pronounced at the Anderson metal-insulator transition. In this
regime, the wave functions are multifractal, while the level statistics
acquires a scale-independent form with distinct critical features. Fluctuations
of the conductance and of the local intensity of a classical wave radiated by a
point-like source in the quasi-1D geometry are also studied within the
sigma-model approach. For a ballistic system with rough surface an
appropriately modified (``ballistic'') sigma-model is used. Finally, the
interplay of the fluctuations and the electron-electron interaction in small
samples is discussed, with application to the Coulomb blockade spectra.

structures in the I-V curve are observed above a certain high field ($H > 1T$

moving flux-line lattice. The Josephson vortex flow states are accordingly
classified into four regions (region I $\sim $ IV with increasing current), in

  School, February 1999",,,,"gr-qc",,"  Superfluid condensates are known to occur in contexts ranging from laboratory
liquid helium to neutron stars, and are also likely to occur in cosmological
phenomena such as axion fields. In the zero temperature limit, such condensates
are describable at a mesoscopic level by irrotational configurations of simple
relativistic perfect fluid models. The general mechanical properties of such
models are presented here in an introductory review giving special attention to
the dynamics of vorticity flux 2-surfaces and the action principles governing
both individual flow trajetories and the evolution of the system as a whole.
Macroscopic rotation of such a condensate requires the presence of a lattice of
quantised vortex defects, whose averaged tension violates perfect fluid
isotropy. It is shown that for any equation of state (relating the mass density
$\rho$ to the pressure $P$) the mesoscopic perfect fluid model can be extended
in a uniquely simple and natural manner to a corresponding macroscopic model
(in a conformally covariant category) that represents the effects of the vortex
fibration anisotropy. The limiting case of an individual vortex defect is shown
to be describable by a (``global'') string type model with a variable tension
${\cal T}$ (obtained as a function of the background fluid density) whose
``vorton'' (i.e. closed loop equilibrium) states are derived as an exercise.

On the other hand, the dilaton theory emerging after spherical reduction and
generalized dilaton theories only during the last years became the subject of
numerous studies which unveiled a surprisingly difficult situation. Recently we
have found some solution to the problem of Hawking flux in spherically reduced
gravity which has the merit of using a minimal input. It leads to exact
cancellation of negative contributions to this radiative flux, encountered in
other approaches at infinity, so that our result asymptotically coincides with
the one of minimally coupled scalars. The use of an integrated action is
avoided - although we have been able to present also that quantity in a closed
expression. This short review also summarizes and critically discusses recent
activities in this field, including the problem of ``conformal frames'' for the
background and questions which seem to be open in our own approach as well as

the neighbourhood of the big bang with an initial, singularity free region of
Euclidean signture, and a signature change. We here show that signature change
can also avoid the singularity of gravitational collapse. We investigate the
process of re-birth of Schwarzschild type black holes, modelling it as a double
signature change, joining two universes of Lorentzian signature through a
Euclidean region which provides a `bounce'. We show that this process is viable
both with and without matter present, but realistic models -- which have the
signature change surfaces hidden inside the horizons -- require non-zero
density. In fact the most realistic models are those that start as a finite
cloud of collapsing matter, surrounded by vacuum. We consider how geodesics may
be matched across a signature change surface, and conclude that the particle
`masses' must jump in value. This scenario may be relevant to Smolin's recent
proposal that a form of natural selection operates on the level of universes,
which favours the type of universe we live in.

distribution functions, we are able to draw unambiguous conclusions about
various features of the model. In particular, we show that the gluon
distribution functions in the absence of quantum corrections behave as 1/x to
all orders in the coupling constant. Furthermore, our distribution functions
exhibit saturation at small transverse momenta. The normalization of the
distribution function we obtain is not arbitrary but specified in terms of the
nucleon structure. We derive a sum rule for the integral of the gluon
distribution function over transverse momenta, and show that the non-Abelian
contributions serve only to modify the shape of the transverse momentum
distribution. We obtain a relatively simple expression for the mean value of
the transverse momentum-squared. The connection between the

experimental BEC data with a parametrization introduced by G. Bertsch et al. in

radius parameter $R_{side}$ an additional temporal dependence which should be
sensitive to a prolonged lifetime of a fireball, in case a QGP was formed in a

of the lattice, defined as the potential connecting these data. Together with
the known circular lattice (a lattice whose elementary quadrilaterals can be
inscribed in circles; the discrete analogue of an orthogonal conjugate net) we
introduce and study two other basic reductions of the quadrilateral lattice:
the symmetric lattice, for which the forward and backward data coincide, and
the D-invariant lattice, characterized by the invariance of a certain natural
frame along the main diagonal. We finally discuss the Egorov lattice, which is,
at the same time, symmetric, circular and D-invariant. The integrability
properties of all these lattices are established using geometric, algebraic and
analytic means; in particular we present a D-bar formalism to construct large
classes of such lattices. We also discuss quadrilateral hyperplane lattices and
the interplay between quadrilateral point and hyperplane lattices in all the
above reductions.

  Transformations and Reductions","27 pages, 9 figures, to appear in Proceedings from the Conference
  ""Symmetries and Integrability of Difference Equations III"", Sabaudia, 1998",,,,"solv-int hep-lat nlin.SI",,"  We review recent results on Integrable Discrete Geometry. It turns out that
most of the known (continuous and/or discrete) integrable systems are
particular symmetries of the quadrilateral lattice, a multidimensional lattice
characterized by the planarity of its elementary quadrilaterals. Therefore the
linear property of planarity seems to be a basic geometric property underlying
integrability. We present the geometric meaning of its tau-function, as the
potential connecting its forward and backward data. We present the theory of
transformations of the quadrilateral lattice, which is based on the discrete
analogue of the theory of rectilinear congruences. In particular, we discuss
the discrete analogues of the Laplace, Combescure, Levy, radial and fundamental
transformations and their interrelations. We also show how the sequence of
Laplace transformations of a quadrilateral surface is described by the discrete
Toda system. We finally show that these classical transformations are strictly
related to the basic operators associated with the quantum field theoretical
formulation of the multicomponent Kadomtsev-Petviashvilii hierarchy. We review
the properties of quadrilateral hyperplane lattices, which play an interesting
role in the reduction theory, when the introduction of additional geometric
structures allows to establish a connection between point and hyperplane
lattices. We present and fully characterize some geometrically distinguished
reductions of the quadrilateral lattice, like the symmetric, circular and
Egorov lattices; we review also basic geometric results of the theory of
quadrilateral lattices in quadrics, and the corresponding analogue of the
Ribaucour reduction of the fundamental transformation.
