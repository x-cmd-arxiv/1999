  http://www.mporzio.astro.it/~mkast/data.html",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope archive, color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) have been constructed for globular cluster 4 in the Fornax dSph
galaxy and its surrounding field. These diagrams extend below the main-sequence
turnoffs and have yielded measurements of the ages of the populations.
  The most prominent features of the CMD of the Fornax field population are a
heavily populated red clump of horizontal branch (HB) stars, a broad red giant
branch (RGB), and a main sequence that spans a large range in luminosity. In
this CMD, there are very few stars at the positions of the HBs of the five
globular clusters in Fornax, which suggests that only a very small fraction of
the field population resembles the clusters in age and chemical composition.
The large span in luminosity of the main-sequence suggests that star formation
began in the field about 12 Gyrs ago and continued to about 0.5 Gyr ago. There
are separate subgiant branches in the CMD, which indicate that the star
formation was not continuous but occurred in bursts. The CMD of cluster 4 has a
steep RGB, from which we estimate [Fe/H] around -2.0. This is considerably
lower than estimates from the integrated light of the cluster, and the origins
of this discrepancy are discussed.

accretion discs. Three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations were performed
using SPH, and the results of these are compared with calculations based on the
linear theory of warped discs. We consider primarily the physical regime in
which the dimensionless viscosity parameter `alpha' < H/r, the disc aspect
ratio, so that bending waves are expected to propagate. We also present
calculations in which `alpha' > H/r, where the warps are expected to behave
diffusively. Small amplitude perturbations are studied in both Keplerian and
slightly non Keplerian discs, and we find that the SPH results can be
reasonably well fitted by those of the linear theory. The main results of these
calculations are: (1) the warp in Keplerian discs when `alpha' < H/r propagates
with little dispersion and damps at a rate expected from estimates of the code
viscosity, (2) warps evolve diffusively when `alpha' > H/r, (3) the non
Keplerian discs exhibit a substantially more dispersive behaviour of the warps.
Initially imposed higher amplitude nonlinear warping disturbances were studied
in Keplerian discs. The results indicate that nonlinear warps can lead to the
formation of shocks, and that the evolution of the warp becomes less wave-like
and more diffusive in character. This work is relevant to the study of the
warped accretion discs that may occur around Kerr black holes or in misaligned
binary systems. The results indicate that SPH can accurately model the
hydrodynamics of warped discs, even when using rather modest numbers of
particles.

of the spectral energy distribution of the C component implies that star
formation in this component started < 100 Myr ago at the NW end, propagated to
the SE and stopped ~ 15 Myr ago. Thus, I Zw 18 is likely to be one of the

compare the spectral indices of our sources between 850um and 1.4GHz to
empirical and theoretical models for distant starburst galaxies and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) as a function of redshift. In this way we can derive
redshift limits for the submm sources, even in the absence of an optical or

\~1mJy has a median redshift of at least <z>~2, more probably <z>~2.5-3, with
almost all galaxies at z>>1. This estimate is a strong lower limit as both
misidentification of the radio counterparts and non-thermal emission from an
AGN will bias our redshift estimates to lower values. The high median redshift
means that the submm population, if predominately powered by starbursts,
contributes a substantial fraction of the total star formation density at high
redshifts. A comparison of the spectral index limits with spectroscopic
redshifts for proposed optical counterparts to individual submm galaxies
suggests that half of the submm sources remain unidentified and thus their

massive: it contains ~2.5x10**9 M_sun of molecular gas, which makes up ~ 8 % of
the dynamical'mass present within a 1.3 kpc radius. Within the CO bar, emission
peaks in two extended clumpy lobes which lie on opposite sides of the nucleus,
separated by ~ 6'' (1 kpc). Between the CO lobes, in the inner 200 pc radius,
resides a powerful central starburst which is forming stars at a rate of 3 to 6
M_sun yr-1. While circular motions dominate the CO velocity field, the CO lobes
show weak bar-like streaming motions on the leading side of the nuclear stellar
bar, suggestive of gas inflow. We estimate semi-analytically the gravitational
torque from the nuclear stellar bar on the gas, and suggest large gas inflow
rates from the CO lobes into the central starburst. These observations, which
are amongst the first ones showing a nuclear stellar bar fuelling molecular gas
into an intense central starburst, are consistent with simulations and theory
which suggest that nuclear bars provide an efficient way of transporting gas
closer to the galactic center to fuel central activity. Furthermore, several
massive clumps are present at low radii, and dynamical friction might produce
further gas inflow. We suggest that the nuclear molecular gas bas and central
activity will be very short-lived, likely disappearing within 5x10**8 years.

The mean metallicities correlate well with sigma0 and dynamical masses, though
relations for MB and Re include significant scatters. We find fundamental
planes defined by surface brightnesses SBe, <[Fe/H]>, and Re (or MB), and the
scatters of which are much smaller than those of the <[Fe/H]>-Re (or MB)

relation, or equivalently, the color-magnitude relation holds not only for the
central part but also for the whole part of galaxies. Using Mg2 and Fe1, we
find <[Mg/Fe]> = +0.2 in most of ellipticals. <[Mg/Fe]> shows no correlation
with galaxy mass tracers. This can be most naturally explained if the star
formation had stopped in ellipticals before the bulk of Type Ia supernovae
began to explode. Ellipticals can have significantly different metallicity
gradients and <[Fe/H]> even if they have the same galaxy mass. This may result
from galaxy mergers, but no evidence is found from presently available data to
support the same origin for metallicity gradients, the scatters around

of the couplings is much larger that of the spins) we construct a generalized
two-temperature thermodynamics. It involves entropies of the spins and the

replica theory with a non-vanishing number of replicas, $n=T/T_J$. For $p>2$
there occur at low temperatures two different glassy phases, depending on the

twinned single crystal, we investigate both vortex guided motion along twins
and the mixed state Hall effect. Firstly, we clearly identify the vortex phase
transition and show that, when the magnetic field is along the twin boundaries
(within about 2 degrees), the vortex solid is a Bose glass.
  Secondly, the effects of twins on the vortex dynamics are studied by
measuring the direction and magnitude of the total electric field while
rotating the current in the ab plane. We observe a partially guided vortex
motion along the dominating twin plane family, already apparent in the vortex
liquid, and becoming more and more pronounced as the temperature or the
magnetic field is reduced. There is no change related to the vortex phase
transition.
  Finally, the mixed state Hall effect is studied, with particular focus given
to the vortex phase transition. We show that the Hall resistivity scaling law
rho_xy=A*rho_xx^b remains unchanged in the vortex solid phase. For a magnetic
field along the twins, the exponent is b=2, corresponding to a constant Hall
conductivity. For a tilted magnetic field, we find b=1.4. In this case, the
Hall conductivity changes sharply at the vortex lattice melting, its slope
becoming much larger in the vortex solid. This effect is strongly current
dependent, and thus demonstrates that the Hall conductivity is pinning
dependent, hopefully solving a long term controversy. We also thoroughly review
the experimental data on the mixed state Hall effect, and discuss some
theoretical models concerning both the anomaly (a sign reversal of the Hall
effect) and the scaling law. A novel model for the Hall scaling law is given,
directly inspired from the theory of percolation in metallic conductors.

study ageing effects within a simple scalar model (the ""soft glassy rheology""
or SGR model) whose constitutive equations relate shear stress to shear strain
among a set of elastic elements, with distributed yield thresholds, undergoing
activated dynamics governed by a ""noise temperature"", $x$. (Between yields,
each element follows affinely the applied shear.) For $1<x<2$ there is a
power-law fluid regime in which transients occur, but no ageing. For $x<1$, the
model has a macroscopic yield stress. So long as this yield stress is not
exceeded, ageing occurs, with a sample's apparent relaxation time being of
order its own age. The (age-dependent) linear viscoelastic loss modulus
$G''(\omega,t)$ rises as frequency is {\em lowered}, but falls with age $t$, so
as to always remain less than $G'(\omega,t)$ (which is nearly constant).
Significant ageing is also predicted for the stress overshoot in nonlinear
shear startup and for the creep compliance. Though obviously oversimplified,
the SGR model may provide a valuable paradigm for the experimental and
theoretical study of rheological ageing phenomena in soft solids.

universe at fine resolution in many wave-lengths, from X-rays to ultraviolet,
optical, and infrared. The archives will be stored at diverse geographical
locations. One of the first of these projects, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) will create a 5-wavelength catalog over 10,000 square degrees of the sky
(see http://www.sdss.org/). The 200 million objects in the multi-terabyte
database will have mostly numerical attributes, defining a space of 100+
dimensions. Points in this space have highly correlated distributions.
  The archive will enable astronomers to explore the data interactively. Data
access will be aided by a multidimensional spatial index and other indices. The
data will be partitioned in many ways. Small tag objects consisting of the most
popular attributes speed up frequent searches. Splitting the data among
multiple servers enables parallel, scalable I/O and applies parallel processing
to the data. Hashing techniques allow efficient clustering and pair-wise
comparison algorithms that parallelize nicely. Randomly sampled subsets allow
debugging otherwise large queries at the desktop. Central servers will operate
a data pump that supports sweeping searches that touch most of the data. The
anticipated queries require special operators related to angular distances and
complex similarity tests of object properties, like shapes, colors, velocity
vectors, or temporal behaviors. These issues pose interesting data management
challenges.

identification from noisy input are described. The main innovation is to
compute confidence limits on the classification, so that the algorithm
terminates when enough evidence to make a clear decision has been made, and so
avoiding problems with categories that have similar characteristics. A second
application, to genre identification, is briefly examined. The results show

numerically integrated to determine the angular deflection and redshift of
photons which propagate through the distortion of the ``warp drive'' bubble to
reach an observer at the origin of the warp effect. We find that for a starship
with an effective warp speed exceeding the speed of light, stars in the forward
hemisphere will appear closer to the direction of motion than they would to an
observer at rest. This aberration is qualitatively similar to that caused by
special relativity. Behind the starship, a conical region forms from within
which no signal can reach the starship, an effective ``horizon''. Conversely,
there is also an horizon-like structure in a conical region in front of the
starship, into which the starship cannot send a signal. These causal structures
are somewhat analogous to the Mach cones associated with supersonic fluid flow.
The existence of these structures suggests that the divergence of quantum
vacuum energy when the starship effectively exceeds the speed of light, first
discovered in two dimensions, will likely be present in four dimensions also,
and prevent any warp-drive starship from ever exceeding the effective speed of
light.

order to better understand the charge concept in gravity. A dimensional
analysis of gauge theories in general and a strict definition of elementary,
monopole, and topological charges are applied to electromagnetism and to

  As a result we inevitably find that the gravitational coupling constant has
dimension $\hbar/l^2$, the mass parameter of a particle dimension $\hbar/l$,
and the Schwarzschild mass parameter dimension l (where l means length). These
dimensions confirm the meaning of mass as elementary and as monopole charge of
the translation group, respectively. In detail, we find that the Schwarzschild
mass parameter is a quasi-electric monopole charge of the time translation
whereas the NUT parameter is a quasi-magnetic monopole charge of the time
translation as well as a topological charge. The Kerr parameter and the
electric and magnetic charges are interpreted similarly. We conclude that each
elementary charge of a Casimir operator of the gauge group is the source of a
(quasi-electric) monopole charge of the respective Killing vector.

theoretical formulation of the general relativity which treats gravity as a

energy-momentum tensor which is: 1) derivable from the Lagrangian in a regular
prescribed way, 2) tensor under arbitrary coordinate transformations, 3)
symmetric in its components, 4) conserved due to the equations of motion
derived from the same Lagrangian, 5) free of the second (highest) derivatives

conditions, that one could demand from an energy-momentum object, acceptable
both on physical and mathematical grounds. The derived gravitational

not containing the critical energies, the eigenfunctions are then shown to be
semi-uniformly exponentially localized, and this implies dynamical
localization: for all $q>0$ and for all $\psi\in\ell^2(\Z)$ with sufficiently

Pb(158 AGeV)Pb reactions and compared to p(158 GeV)Pb collisions. The
microscopic transport model UrQMD is used for this analysis. The predicted
Lambda/pi-, Xi-/pi- and Omega-/pi- ratios are enhanced due to rescattering in
central Pb-Pb collisions as compared to peripheral Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions. A
reduction of the constituent quark masses to the current quark masses m_s \sim
230 MeV, m_q \sim 10 MeV, as motivated by chiral symmetry restoration, enhances
the hyperon yields to the experimentally observed high values. Similar results
are obtained by an ad hoc overall increase of the color electric field strength
(effective string tension of kappa=3 GeV/fm). The enhancement depends strongly
on the kinematical cuts. The maximum enhancement is predicted around
midrapidity. For Lambda's, strangeness suppression is predicted at
projectile/target rapidity. For Omega's, the predicted enhancement can be as
large as one order of magnitude. Comparisons of Pb-Pb data to proton induced
asymmetric (p-A) collisions are hampered due to the predicted strong asymmetry
in the various rapidity distributions of the different (strange) particle
species. In p-Pb collisions, strangeness is locally (in rapidity) not
conserved. The present comparison to the data of the WA97 and NA49
collaborations clearly supports the suggestion that conventional (free)
hadronic scenarios are unable to describe the observed high (anti-)hyperon
yields in central collisions. The doubling of the strangeness to nonstrange
suppression factor, gamma_s \approx 0.65, might be interpreted as a signal of a
phase of nearly massless particles.
