``micro-storms'' rotating around the magnetic axis of the 1.1s pulsar PSR
0943+10. Such a feature hints that most probably the large-voltage vacuum gap
proposed by Ruderman & Sutherland (RS) does exist in the pulsar polar cap.
However, there are severe arguments against the formation of the RS-type gap in
pulsars, since the binding energies of both the Fe ions and the electrons in a
neutron star's surface layer is too small to prevent thermionic ejection of the
particles from the surface. Here we propose that PSR 0943+10 (probably also
most of the other ``drifting'' pulsars) might be bare strange stars rather than
normal neutron stars, in which the ``binding energy'' at the surface is merely
infinity either for the case of ``pulsar'' or ``anti-pulsar''. It is further
proposed that identifying a drifting pulsar as an anti-pulsar is the key
criterion to distinguish strange stars from neutron stars.

the cluster Abell 1942 has uncovered a mass concentration $\sim 7$ arcminutes
South of the cluster center. A statistical analysis shows that the detections
are highly significant. No strong concentration of bright galaxies is seen at
the position of the mass concentration, though a slight galaxy number
overdensity and a weak extended X-ray source are present about 1' away from its
center.
  From the spatial dependence of the tangential alignment around the center of
the mass concentration, we inferred a lower bound on the mass inside a sphere
of radius $0.5 h^{-1}$\ts Mpc of $1\times 10^{14}h^{-1}M_\odot$, much higher
than crude mass estimates based on X-ray data. No firm conclusion can be
inferred about the nature of the clump. If it were a high-redshift cluster, the
weak X-ray flux would indicate that it had an untypically low X-ray luminosity
for its mass; if the X-ray emission were physically unrelated to the mass
concentration, this conclusion would be even stronger.
  The search for massive halos by weak lensing enables us for the first time to
select halos based on their mass properties only and to detect new types of
objects, e.g., dark halos. The mass concentration in the field of A1942 may be
the first example of such a halo.

experimental data including all resonance peaks measured so far. The Lorentzian
shape of the resonances, which we obtain via a generalized master equation that
includes spin tunneling, is also in good agreement with recent data. We derive
a general formula for the tunnel splitting energy of these resonances. We show
that fourth-order diagonal terms in the Hamiltonian lead to satellite peaks. A
derivation of the effective linewidth of a resonance peak is given and shown to
agree well with experimental data. In addition, previously unknown spin-phonon
coupling constants are calculated explicitly. The values obtained for these

provided by inducing a change in the current flowing through the detector. In
the present experiment we perform a more intriguing WP determination: only a
phase change is being induced in the detector while the current remains
unaffected. We show that such detector-interferometer interaction can be
understood both, from the WP information obtained by the detector, or
alternatively by understanding the disturbance in the interferometer caused by
the detector. Moreover, we address the subtle role of detector coherency and
