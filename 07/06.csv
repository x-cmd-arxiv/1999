stars. The line bisectors of the most metal-poor star, the subgiant HD140283,
show a significantly larger velocity span that the expectations for a

enhanced line asymmetries are interpreted as the signature of the lower metal

findings point out the importance of three-dimensional convective velocity
fields in the interpretation of the observed line asymmetries in metal-poor
stars, and in particular, urge for caution when deriving isotopic ratios from
observed line shapes and shifts using one-dimensional model atmospheres.
  The mean line bisector of the photospheric atomic lines is compared with
those measured for the strong Mg I b1 and b2 features. The upper part of the
bisectors are similar, and assuming they overlap, the bottom end of the
stronger lines, which are formed higher in the atmosphere, goes much further to
the red. This is in agreement with the expected decreasing of the convective
blue-shifts in upper atmospheric layers, and compatible with the high velocity
redshifts observed in the chromosphere, transition region, and corona of
late-type stars.

product of the mean velocity gradient and the cross-helicity correlation of the
isotropic parts of the fluctuating velocity and magnetic field,
$\lb{\bfv}\cdot{\bfb}\rb^{(0)}$. The full mean field equations are derived to
linear order in mean fields, but it is also shown that the cross-helicity term
survives to all orders in the velocity shear. This cross-helicity term can
obviate the need for a pre-existing seed mean magnetic field for mean field
growth: though a fluctuating seed field is necessary for a non-vanishing
cross-helicity, the term can produce linear (in time) mean field growth of the
toroidal field from zero mean field. After one vertical diffusion time, the
cross-helicity term becomes sub-dominant and dynamo exponential
amplification/sustenance of the mean field can subsequently ensue. The
cross-helicity term should produce odd symmetry in the mean magnetic field, in
contrast to the usually favored even modes of the dynamo amplification in
sheared discs. This may be important for the observed mean field geometries of
spiral galaxies. The strength of the mean seed field provided by the cross-
helicity depends linearly on the magnitude of the cross-helicity.

that this emission is anisotropic, which leads us to identify CCCs with the
misoriented relativistic jet component which dominates in BL Lac objects. This
interpretation is also supported by the similarity in the radio-to-optical and

  The high rate of CCC detection (85 %) suggests that a `standard' pc scale,

the lack of broad lines in FR I cannot be attributed to obscuration.

flat expanding 1D universes with scale-free power spectra of primordial
perturbations. The collapsed objects in the simulations are located with a
clump-finding algorithm designed to find regions that have undergone orbit
crossing or that are in the multi-stream regime (these are different as an
effect of the finite size of the multi-stream regions). It is found that the
semi-analytical mass function theory, which has no free parameters, is able to
recover the properties of collapsed objects both statistically and object by
object. In particular, the predictions of regions in orbit crossing are
optimized by the use of Gaussian filtering, while the use of sharp k-space
filtering apparently allows to reproduce the larger multi-stream regions. The
mass function theory does not reproduce well the clumps found with the standard
friends-of-friends algorithm; however, the performance of this algorithm has

basis a new way of interpreting the depletions in terms of `continuous' dust
processing through erosion in the interstellar medium is presented. The
observed depletion patterns can then be understood in terms of a gradually
changing grain chemical composition as the erosion of the atoms proceeds
non-stoichiometrically in the low-density interstellar medium. The
stoichiometric erosion of multicomponent (e.g., core/mantle) single grains can
qualitatively explain the observed depletions but is not consistent with the

entropy up to the level required by current cluster observations the energy
provided by supernovae is unlikely to be sufficient. Indeed, the efficiency
factor needed for the supernova scenario is of order unity while for quasars we
get a value ~ 0.008. Thus the IGM is more likely to have been reheated by
quasars. Moreover, we find that if both scenarios are normalized to present

such a reheating process may partly account for the decline at low redshift of
the comoving star formation rate and of the quasar luminosity function. In

differences in bulk Lorentz factor of shells. Tighter constraints on the
possible range of Gamma are derived by requiring that the internal shocks
transform more than a few per cent of the bulk energy into radiation. Efficient
bursts may require a hierarchical scenario, where a shell undergoes multiple

additionally show evidence for a relation between age and luminosity, in the
direction predicted by the semi-analytic hierarchical clustering models of

apply two recently proposed interdependence measures which should give similar
results as cross predictabilities used by previous authors. The systems which
we study are asymmetrically coupled simple models (Lorenz, Roessler, and Henon
models), the couplings being such as to lead to generalized synchronization. If
the data were perfect (noisefree, infinitely long), we should be able to
detect, at least in some cases, which of the coupled systems is the driver and
which the response. This might no longer be true if the time series has finite
length. Instead, estimated interdependencies and mutual cross predictabilities
depend strongly on which of the systems has a higher effective dimension at the
typical neighborhood sizes used to estimate them, and causal relationships are
more difficult to detect. We also show that slightly different variants of the
interdependence measure can have quite different sensitivities.

that depend on the coframe variables. The paper exhibits the class of operators
that are invariant under a general change of coordinates, and, also, invariant
under the global SO(1,3)-transformation of the coframe. A general class of
field equations is constructed. We display two subclasses in it. The subclass
of field equations that are derivable from action principles by free variations
and the subclass of field equations for which spherical-symmetric solutions,
Minkowskian at infinity exist. Then, for the spherical-symmetric solutions, the
resulting metric is computed. Invoking the Geodesic Postulate, we find all the
equations that are experimentally (by the 3 classical tests) indistinguishable
from Einstein field equations. This family includes, of course, also Einstein
equations. Moreover, it is shown, explicitly, how to exhibit it. The basic tool
employed in the paper is an invariant formulation reminiscent of Cartan's
structural equations. The article sheds light on the possibilities and
limitations of the coframe gravity. It may also serve as a general procedure to
derive covariant field equations.

We perform a complete harmonic analysis of the bosonic linearized fluctuations

find that the spectrum precisely agrees with that of the physical operators of
Matrix theory. The explicit forms of two-point functions give predictions for
the large $N$ behavior of Matrix theory with some special cutoff. We discuss
the possible implications of our results for the large N dynamics of

with symmetry. For a Riemannian manifold M admitting a compact Lie group G as
an isometry group, the quotient space Q = M/G is not a smooth manifold in
general but stratified into a collection of smooth manifolds of various
dimensions. If the action of the compact group G is free, M is made into a
principal fiber bundle with structure group G. In this case, reduced quantum
systems are set up as quantum systems on the associated vector bundles over Q =
M/G. This idea of reduction fails, if the action of G on M is not free.
However, the Peter-Weyl theorem works well for reducing quantum systems on M.
When applied to the space of wave functions on M, the Peter-Weyl theorem
provides the decomposition of the space of wave functions into spaces of
equivariant functions on M, which are interpreted as Hilbert spaces for reduced
quantum systems on Q. The concept of connection on a principal fiber bundle is
generalized to be defined well on the stratified manifold M. Then the reduced
Laplacian is well defined as a self-adjoint operator with the boundary
conditions on singular sets of lower dimensions. Application to quantum
molecular mechanics is also discussed in detail. In fact, the reduction of
quantum systems studied in this paper stems from molecular mechanics. If one
wishes to consider the molecule which is allowed to lie in a line when it is in
motion, the reduction method presented in this paper works well.
