transfer calculations for three representative types of galactic environments,
filled with either homogeneous or two-phase clumpy dust distributions.
Extinction and scattering properties for two types of interstellar dust,
similar to those found in the average diffuse medium of the Milky Way Galaxy
(MW) and the Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), are considered. The
wavelength coverage extends from 1000 A to 30,000 A, with particular emphasis
on the rest-frame UV. This makes these models especially applicable to
starburst galaxies and Lyman-break galaxy samples. The examination of the
models concentrates on the study of UV/visual/near-IR reddening effects, the
wavelength dependence of attenuation, and on the changes that arise from the
transition from homogeneous to clumpy dust distributions in different star/dust
geometries. Embedded dust, especially when clumpy, leads to saturation at
fairly low reddening values with correspondingly gray attenuation functions.
This makes the assessment of the attenuation of the far-UV flux from starburst
galaxies difficult, if only UV/visual/near-IR data are available. Existing data
for UV-selected starburst galaxies indicate a range of UV attenuation factors
of 0-150. Our models reproduce the ""Calzetti Attenuation Law"", provided one
adopts SMC-type dust and a clumpy shell-type dust distribution surrounding the
starbursts. The average far-UV attenuation factor for the Calzetti sample is
found to be 7.4. The only relatively reliable measure for the UV attenuation
factor for single galaxies was found in the ratio of the integrated far-IR flux
to the far-UV flux, measured near 1600 A, requiring the measurement of the
entire spectral energy distribution of galaxies.

with a tilted ring model. We compare our rotation curve with previous ones and
discuss the differences. The velocity field of the CO pointings fit very well
with the one of the atomic gas where they overlap. The CO emission permits to
extend the rotation curve towards the galaxy centre. The molecular fraction is
derived for the inner 120"" x 120"" centered on the galaxy. We compare the HI and
CO emission to H_alpha line and optical blue emission maps. The bar in the
centre favors star formation at the outer end of the bar. The HI intensity
distribution and velocity field of the northern perturbation are deprojected
with the help of a first order kinematical model. They are discussed in the

HI deficiency is now fading after the galaxy's close passage to the cluster

interval of the bright Seyfert~1 galaxy MCG--6-30-15. The data clearly confirm
the presence of a broad skewed iron line ($W_{K\alpha} \sim$ 266 eV) and
Compton reflection continuum at higher energies reported in our previous paper.
We also investigate whether the gravitational and Doppler effects that affect
the iron line may also be manifest in the reflected continuum. The uniqueness
of this data set is underlined by the extremely good statistics that we obtain
from the approximately four million photons that make up the 2-20 keV RXTE PCA
spectrum alone. This, coupled with the high energy coverage of HEXTE and the
spectral resolution of ASCA in the iron line regime has allowed us to constrain
the relationship between abundance and reflection fraction for the first time
at the 99 per cent confidence level. The reflection fraction is entirely
consistent with a flat disk, i.e. the cold material subtends $\rm 2 \pi$ sr at
the source, to an accuracy of 20 per cent. Monte Carlo simulations show that
the observed strong iron line intensity is explained by an overabundance of
iron by a factor of $\sim$ 2 and an underabundance of the lower-Z elements by a
similar factor. By considering non-standard abundances, a clear and consistent
picture can be made in which both the iron line and reflection continuum come
from the same material such as e.g. an accretion disk.

dark matter halos, we have made such measurements for the Milky Way by two
independent methods, which make use of the stellar kinematics in the solar
neighbourhood and the observed flaring of the Galactic HI layer to estimate the
flattening of the Galactic dark halo. These techniques are found to produce a
consistent estimate for the halo shape, with a shortest-to-longest axis ratio
of q ~ 0.8, but only if one adopts somewhat non-standard values for the
distance to the Galactic centre, R_0, and the local Galactic rotation speed,
Theta_0. For consistency, one requires values of R_0 < 7.6 kpc and Theta_0 <
190 km/s. Although differing significantly from the current IAU-sanctioned
values, these upper limits are consistent with all existing observational
constraints. If future measurements confirm these lower values for the Galactic
constants, then the validity of the gas layer flaring method will be confirmed.
Further, dark matter candidates such as cold molecular gas and massive decaying
neutrinos, which predict very flat dark halos with q < 0.2, will be ruled out.
Conversely, if the Galactic constants were found to be close to the more
conventional values, then there would have to be some systematic error in the
methods for measuring dark halo shapes, so the existing modeling techniques
would have to be viewed with some scepticism.

anomalous scaling dimension of the superfluid order-field is positive, while we
find that the anomalous dimension of the dual field is negative. The dual
gauge-field does not decouple from the dual complex matter-field at the
critical point. {\it These two critical theories represent separate fixed
points.} The physical meaning of a negative $\eta_{\phi}$ is that the
vortex-loop tangle of the superfluid at the critical point fills space {\it
more} efficiently than random walkers, {\it without collapsing}. This is due to
the presence of the massless dual gauge-field, and the resulting long-ranged
{\it vectorial} Biot-Savart interaction between vortex-loop segments, which is
a relevant perturbation to the steric $|\psi|^4$ repulsion term. Hence, the
critical dual theory is not in the universality class of the $|\psi|^4$-theory.

EP, the subclass of NP consisting of those languages accepted by NP machines
that when they accept always have a number of accepting paths that is a power
of two. Since if any NP-complete set is in EP then all NP sets are in EP, it
follows---with whatever degree of strength one believes that EP differs from

NP-complete.
  We show that the negation equivalence problem for OBDDs (ordered binary

EP^{NP}, thus tightening the existing NP^{NP} upper bound. We show that FewP,
bounded ambiguity polynomial time, is contained in EP, a result that is not

classes just mentioned with regard to EP, no proof of membership/containment in

current quark masses, universal string tension, and phenomenological constants
describing nonstring short-range interaction. The meson Regge trajectories are
in general nonlinear; practically linear are only trajectories for light-quark
mesons with non-zero lowest spins. The model predicts masses of many new
higher-spin mesons. A new $K^*(1^-)$ meson is predicted with mass 1910 Mev. In
some cases the masses of new low-spin mesons are predicted by extrapolation of
the phenomenological short-range parameters in the quark masses. In this way
the model predicts the mass of $\eta_b(1S)(0^{-+})$ to be $9500\pm 30$ MeV, and
the mass of $B_c(0^-)$ to be $6400\pm 30$ MeV (the potential model predictions

allow one to calculate the energy and spin structure of mesons. The average

mirror nuclei, $^{15}$O -- $^{15}$N, $^{17}$F -- $^{17}$O, $^{39}$Ca --
$^{39}$K and $^{41}$Sc -- $^{41}$Ca, are calculated using the quark-meson
coupling (QMC) model. The calculation involves nuclear structure and shell
effects explicitly. It is shown that binding energy differences of a few
hundred keV arise from the strong interaction, even after subtracting all
electromagnetic corrections. The origin of these differences may be ascribed to
the charge symmetry breaking effects set in the strong interaction through the
u and d current quark mass difference.

effective range expansion in Quantum Mechanics, which is shown to have a much
larger convergence radius than ordinary chiral perturbation theory, allowing
one to reproduce data for meson meson interaction up to 1.2 GeV. Applications
to physical processes so far unsuited for a standard chiral perturbative
approach are presented, in which two hadrons, either two mesons or a meson and
a baryon, in a resonant state are produced in photoproduction processes.

between the quasiperiodic soliton and partially incoherent spatial solitary
waves recently generated experimentally.

notion is that of null phase curves in quantum mechanical ray and Hilbert
spaces. Examples of such curves are developed. Our generalisation is shown to
be essential to properly understand geometric phase results in the cases of
coherent states and of Gaussian states. Differential geometric aspects of null
phase curves are also briefly explored.

  comprehension and to facilitate further development of the theory. Some
  typographical errors have been corrected",,,"UNZAPHYS-006","quant-ph",,"  The approach to quantum mechanics which we have used to derive the matrix
treatment of spin from first principles is now employed to treat systems of
compounded angular momentum. A general treatment is first given, which is then
applied to the concrete cases of a spin-0 and a spin-1 system obtained by
adding the spins of two spin-1/2 systems. Thus the probability amplitudes for
measurements on the systems are derived, as well as the matrix vectors and
operators corresponding to the systems. The matrix operators and states
obtained are different from the standard forms and are much more generalized.
The new results are applied to the case of joint measurements on the subsystems
of such a system; this is a problem that has been made very topical by the high
level of interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics. As a consequence of
the insights arising from this treatment, we show that the Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients are amenable to generalization, and we give the generalized forms
for these cases.
