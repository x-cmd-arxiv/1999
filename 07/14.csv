classical recipe: LTE line formation and homogeneous, plane-parallel,
flux-constant, and LTE model atmospheres. We review different results in the
literature that have suggested significant inconsistencies in the spectroscopic
analyses, pointing out the difficulties in deriving independent estimates of
the stellar fundamental parameters and hence,detecting systematic errors.
  The trigonometric parallaxes measured by the HIPPARCOS mission provide
accurate appraisals of the stellar surface gravity for nearby stars, which are
used here to check the gravities obtained from the photospheric iron ionization
balance. We find an approximate agreement for stars in the metallicity range -1
<= [Fe/H] <= 0, but the comparison shows that the differences between the
spectroscopic and trigonometric gravities decrease towards lower metallicities
for more metal-deficient dwarfs (-2.5 <= [Fe/H] <= -1.0), which casts a shadow
upon the abundance analyses for extreme metal-poor stars that make use of the
ionization equilibrium to constrain the gravity. The comparison with the
strong-line gravities derived by Edvardsson (1988) and Fuhrmann (1998a)
confirms that this method provides systematically larger gravities than the
ionization balance. The strong-line gravities get closer to the physical ones
for the stars analyzed by Fuhrmann, but they are even further away than the
iron ionization gravities for the stars of lower gravities in Edvardsson's
sample. The confrontation of the deviations of the iron ionization gravities in
metal-poor stars reported here with departures from the excitation balance
found in the literature, show that they are likely to be induced by the same
physical mechanism(s).

escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons from the galaxy to f_esc <= 0.02.
With the assumption that the cloud is shielded from all galactic contributions,
we can constrain the intensity and shape of the extragalactic continuum. For an
AGN-dominated power-law extragalactic spectrum, we derive a limit on the
extragalactic ionizing flux Phi_ion >= 2600 photons cm^-2 s^-1, or I_0 >=
10^-23 erg cm^-2 s^-1 Hz^-1 sr^-1 for an ionizing spectrum with power-law index

limits from the absence of H_alpha recombination emission from intergalactic
clouds, our observations require 2600 <= Phi_ion <= 10000 photons cm^-2 s^-1.
We show that if galactic contributions to the incident radiation are important,
it is difficult to constrain Phi_ion. These results demonstrate that galactic

largest change caused by the new method is in the disk-wind opening angle:
winds driven only by the disk radiation are more polar with the new method

impulsive phase hard X-ray emission from solar flares. This work is motivated
by the YOHKOH and the forthcoming HESSI observations. Summarizing past results,
it is shown that the transport effects can account for the observations by
inhomogeneous loops where there is a strong field convergence and/or density
enhancement at the top of the flaring loop. Scattering by plasma turbulence at
the acceleration site or pancake type pitch angle distribution of the
accelerated electrons can also give rise to enhanced emission at the loop tops.
These could be a natural consequence of acceleration by plasma waves. This
paper considers a general case of stochastic scattering and acceleration that
leads to an isotropic pitch angle distribution and an enhanced emission from
the loop tops or the acceleration site.
  Following the formalism developed in earlier papers the strength and the
spectrum of the radiation expected from the acceleration site and the foot
points are evaluated and their dependence on the parameters describing the
acceleration process and the flare plasma are determined. The theoretical ratio
of these two intensities and relative values of their spectral indices are
compared with the YOHKOH observations, demonstrating that the above mentioned
parameters can be constrained with such observations. It is shown that future
high spatial and spectral resolution observations, for example those expected
from HESSI, can begin to distinguish between different models and constrain
their parameters.

combined with the known age of the remnant, determines the expansion parameter
m, defined as $R\propto t^m$, to be 0.93 (+/-0.06) (+0.07,-0.04). The error
bars on these results include both statistical (first set of errors) and

twice as fast as the mean expansion rate of the radio remnant. The expansion
rates as a function of radius and azimuthal angle are also presented based on

calculations show that the electronic structure near the Fermi energy consists
of a manifold of 12 bands derived from V $t_{2g}$ states, weakly hybridized
with O p states. While the total width of this active manifold is approximately
2 eV, it may be roughly decomposed into two groups: high velocity bands and
flatter bands, although these mix in density functional calculations. The flat
bands, which are the more atomic-like lead to a high density of states and
magnetic instability of local moment character. The value of the on-site
exchange energy is sensitive to the exact exchange correlation parameterization
used in the calculations, but is much larger than the interaction between
neighboring spins, reflecting the weak coupling of the magnetic system with the
high velocity bands. A scenario for the observed heavy fermion behavior is
discussed in which conduction electrons in the dispersive bands are weakly
scattered by local moments associated with strongly correlated electrons in the
heavy bands.This is analogous to that in conventional Kondo type heavy
fermions, but is unusual in that both the local moments and conduction
electrons come from the same d-manifold.

unitary representation: the principal series module of the affine current
algebra SL(2,R) supplemented with zero modes. Zero modes play an important role
in the description of on-shell states as well as of windings in space-time at
the AdS(3) boundary. The theory is presented as part of the supersymmetric WZW
model that includes the supergroup SU(2/1,1) or OSp(4/2) or D(2,1;\alpha) with
central extension k. A free field representation is given and the vertex
operators are constructed in terms of free fields in SL(2,R) principal series
representation bases that are labeled by position space or momentum space at
the boundary of AdS(3). The vertex operators have the correct operator products
with the currents and stress tensor, all of which are constructed from free
fields, including the subtle zero modes. It is shown that as k goes to
infinity, AdS(3) tends to flat 3D-Minkowski space and the AdS(3) vertex
operators in momentum space tend to the vertex operators of flat 3D-string
theory (furthermore the theory readjusts smoothly in the rest of the dimensions
in this limit).

ambient isotopy) only a finite number of such exceptional surgery curves in a
given compact orientable 3-manifold M, with the boundary of M a (possibly

dynamical evolution of an initially hot cylindrical rod endowed with a
longitudinal Bjorken scaling expansion (a ``Bjorken rod''). The field equation
is propagated until full decoupling has occurred and the asymptotic many-body
state of free pions is then obtained by a suitable Fourier decomposition of the
field and a subsequent stochastic determination of the number of quanta in each
elementary mode. The resulting transverse pion spectrum exhibits visible
enhancements below 200 MeV due to the parametric amplification caused by the
oscillatory relaxation of the chiral order parameter. Ensembles of such final
states are subjected to various event-by-event analyses. The factorial moments
of the multiplicity distribution suggest that the soft pions are
non-statistical. Furthermore, their emission patterns exhibit azimuthal
correlations that have a bearing on the domain size in the source. Finally, the
distribution of the neutral pion fraction shows a significant broadening for
the soft pions which grows steadily as the number of azimuthal segments is
increased. All of these features are indicative of disoriented chiral
condensates and it may be interesting to apply similar analyses to actual data
from high-energy nuclear collision experiments.

deduced from the strong-interaction level shifts and widths in X-ray spectra of
$K^-$ and $\bar p$ atoms produce effective repulsion leading to substantial
suppression of the {\it atomic} wave functions within the nucleus. The width of
atomic levels then saturates as function of the strength of Im $V_{{\rm opt}}$.
We find that `deeply bound' atomic states, which are inaccessible in the atomic
cascade process, are generally narrow, due to this mechanism, over the entire
periodic table %reaching values of $\Gamma_{K^-} \sim 1.7$ MeV and
%$\Gamma_{\bar p} \sim 1.9$ MeV for the $1s$ state in Pb, and should be
reasonably well resolved. These predictions are insensitive to $V_{{\rm opt}}$,
provided it was fitted to the observed X-ray spectra. In contrast, the {\it
nuclear} states bound by $V_{{\rm opt}}$ are very broad and their spectrum
depends sensitively on details of $V_{{\rm opt}}$. We discuss production
reactions for $K^-$ atomic states using slow $K^-$ mesons from the decay of the
$\phi$(1020) vector meson, and the ($\bar p, p$) reaction for $\bar p$ atomic
states. Rough cross-section estimates are given.

facing in the first place the break down of simultaneity, and secondly, a

confinement to the velocity of light, as the only possible ways that resolve
