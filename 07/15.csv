obtained through a 12 arcsec diameter aperture centered on different locations

nucleus; the nucleus was on the eastern edge of the aperture. The second (A2)
was centered southwest of the optical nucleus with the nucleus well inside the

on the southwestern edge of the aperture. While all three aperture locations
have spectra similar to the Astro-1 observations of Kriss et al., these new
spatially resolved observations localize the source of the far-UV line and
continuum emission. The ionization cone (B) has both brighter emission lines
and continuum than the nucleus (A2). A1 is fainter than either A2 or B in both
lines and continuum. The far-UV emission lines observed with HUT have a spatial
distribution that most similar to [O III] 5007, but appear to be more extended
and offset to the northeast along the axis of the radio jet. This supports the
previous conclusion of Kriss et al. that the bright C III 977 and N III 991
arises in shock-heated gas. The UV continuum radiation has a more extended
spatial distribution than the line-emitting gas. At wavelengths longward of
1200 A the inferred continuum distribution is consistent with that seen in

nuclear flux scattered by hot electrons and dust.

final fate of ionizing objects. The main results are: (i) galaxies reionize the
IGM by z~10 (with some uncertainty related to the gas clumping factor), whereas
H2 is completely dissociated already by z~25; (ii) reionization is mostly due
to the relatively massive objects which collapse via H line cooling, while
objects whose formation relies on H2 cooling alone are insufficient to this
aim; (iii) the diffuse soft UV background is the major source of radiative
feedback effects for z<15; at higher z direct flux from neighboring objects
dominates; (iv) the match of the calculated cosmic star formation history with
the one observed at lower redshifts suggests that the conversion efficiency of
baryons into stars is ~1%; (v) we find that a very large population of dark

constrain the fraction of machos in the dark halo. The effect of patchiness of
dust can be controled by working with faint stars in the smallest patches of
the sky around the microlensed stars. This can be done most effectively with

observable properties of active galaxies through its gravity, and by mass
injection through stellar winds, supernovae and stellar collisions. Mass
injection generates a nuclear ISM which flows under gravitational and radiative

interest in this approach. Recently collected data have been used to address
the problem of measuring the cosmological parameters of the universe. Analysed
in the framework of homogeneous models, they have yielded, as a primary result,
a strictly positive cosmological constant. However, a straight reading of the
published measurements, conducted with no a priori idea of which model would
best describe our universe at least up to redshifts $z\sim 1$, does not exclude
the possibility of ruling out the Cosmological Principle - and cosmological
constant - hypotheses. It is therefore shown here how the large scale
homogeneity of this part of the universe can be tested on our past light cone,
using the magnitude-redshift relation, provided sufficiently accurate data from
sources at redshifts approaching $z=1$ would be available. An exemple of an
inhomogeneous model with zero cosmological constant reproducing the current
observations is given. The presently published SNIa data can thus be
interpreted as implying either a strictly positive cosmological constant in a
homogeneous universe or large scale inhomogeneity with no constraint on
$\Lambda$. An increase in the number and measurement accuracy of the candidate
``standard candles'' at very high redshift is therefore urgently needed, for
progress in both fundamental issues of the Cosmological Principle and
cosmological constant.

assumed slope of 0.18 in the $M_{\rm V}$-[Fe/H] relation. This is 0.28
magnitude brighter than the value Fernley et al. (1998a) derived by employing
the method of statistical parallax for the {\it identical} sample and using the
same slope.
  We point out that a similar difference exists between the ``reduced
parallaxes'' method and the statistical parallax method for the Cepheids in the
Hipparcos catalogue.
  We also determine the zero point for the $M_{\rm K}$-$\log P_{0}$ relation,
and obtain a value of -1.16 $\pm$ 0.27 mag (for a slope of -2.33). The distance
moduli to the Hipparcos RR Lyrae stars derived from the two relations agree
well.
  The derived distance scale is in good agreement with the results from the
Main Sequence fitting distances of Galactic globular clusters and with the
results of theoretical Horizontal Branch models, and implies a distance modulus
to the LMC of 18.61 $\pm$ 0.28 mag.

quantum field theories which can be exactly (non-perturbatively) and explicitly
solved. Abelian Chern-Simons theory provides a field theoretic interpretation
of the linking and self-linking numbers of a link. In non-Abelian theories,
vacuum expectation values of Wilson link operators yield a class of polynomial
link invariants; the simplest of them is the famous Jones polynomial. Other
invariants obtained are more powerful than that of Jones. Powerful methods for
completely analytical and non-perturbative computation of these knot and link
invariants have been developed. In the process answers to some of the open
problems in knot theory are obtained. From these invariants for unoriented and
framed links in $S^3$, an invariant for any three-manifold can be easily
constructed by exploiting the Lickorish-Wallace surgery presentation of
three-manifolds. This invariant up to a normalization is the partition function
of the Chern-Simons field theory. Even perturbative analysis of the

way. The Planck mass and F- and D-terms appear via the gauge-fixed value of a
superfield that we call conformon. We find that in general the probability of
gravitino production is not suppressed by the small gravitational coupling.
This may lead to a copious production of gravitinos after inflation. Efficiency
of the new non-thermal mechanism of gravitino production is very sensitive to
the choice of the underlying theory. This may put strong constraints on certain

the existence of a ``spectral variety'' generalizing the spectral curve of the

find that the quasipotential equations devised to satisfy the one-body limit
for the $t$-channel exchange potential can be in large disagreement with the
field-theoretical prediction in the case of $u$-channel exchange interactions.
Within the spectator model, the description of the $u$-channel case improves if
another choice of the spectator particle is made. Since the appropriate choice
of the spectator depends strongly on the type of interaction used, one faces a
problem when both types of interaction are contained in the potential.
Equal-time formulations are presented, which, in the light-heavy particle
system corresponding to the mass situation of the $\pi N$ system, approximate
in a reasonable way the field-theoretical result for both types of
