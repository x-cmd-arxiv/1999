  M. van Breughel",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The strength of the submillimeter background light shows directly that much
of the energy radiated by star formation and AGN is moved to far infrared
wavelengths. However, it is only as this background at 850 microns has been
resolved with direct submillimeter imaging that we have seen that it is created
by a population of ultraluminous (or near ultraluminous) infrared galaxies
(ULIGs) which appear to lie at relatively high redshifts (z>1). Mapping the
redshift evolution of this major portion of the universal star formation has
been difficult because of the poor submillimeter spatial resolution, but this
difficulty can be overcome by using extremely deep cm continuum radio
observations to obtain precise astrometric information since the bulk of the
brighter submillimeter sources have detectable radio counterparts. However,
with this precise position information available, we find that most of the
submillimeter sources are extremely faint in the optical and near infrared
(I>>24 and K=21-22) and inaccessible to optical spectroscopy. Rough photometric
redshift estimates can be made from combined radio and submillimeter energy
distributions. We shall refer to this procedure as millimetric redshift
estimation to distinguish it from photometric estimators in the optical and
near IR. These estimators place the bulk of the submillimeter population at
z=1-3, where it corresponds to the high redshift tail of the faint cm radio
population. While still preliminary, the results suggest that the submillimeter
population appears to dominate the star formation in this redshift range by
almost an order of magnitude over the mostly distinct populations selected in
the optical-ultraviolet.

reaction rates with nucleons via the neutral and charged currents in the
supernova core in the relativistic random phase approximation (RPA) and study
their effects on the opacity of the supernova core. The formulation is based on
the Lagrangian employed in the calculation of nuclear equation of state (EOS)
in the relativistic mean field theory (RMF). The nonlinear meson terms are
treated appropriately so that the consistency of the density correlation
derived in RPA with the thermodynamic derivative obtained from EOS by RMF is
satisfied in the static and long wave length limit. We employ pion and rho
meson exchange interactions together with the phenomenological Landau-Migdal
parameters for the isospin-dependent nuclear interactions. We find that both
the charged and neutral current reaction rates are suppressed from the standard
Bruenn's approximate formula considerably in the high density regime. In the
low density regime, on the other hand, the vector current contribution to the
neutrino-nucleon scattering rate is enhanced in the vicinity of the boundary of
the liquid-gas phase transition, while the other contributions are moderately
suppressed there also. In the high temperature regime or in the regime where
electrons have a large chemical potential, the latter of which is important
only for the electron capture process and its inverse process, the recoil of
nucleons cannot be neglected and further reduces the reaction rates with
respect to the standard approximate formula which discards any energy transfer
in the processes. These issues could have a great impact on the neutrino
heating mechanism of collapse-driven supernovae.

we simulate formation of 14 galaxies with different masses and spin parameters,

We find that the simulated galaxies reproduce the slope and scatter of the TF
relation: the slope is originated in the difference of total galactic masses,
and the scatter is produced by the difference of initial spin parameters. As
well as the TF relation, observed features of spiral galaxies, such as the

After that, the star formation proceeded at a low rate until the recent past,
the age of the most recent traces of star formation activity detected in the
galaxy being some 100 Myr.
  The star formation rate, $\psi(t)$ for old and intermediate ages shows a
gradient in the sense of taking smaller values for higher galactocentric radii.
Moreover, recent star formation is detected in the central
  $150 \times 90$ pc$^2$ only, where the youngest, 100 Myr old population is
found. The luminous blue {\it stars} discovered by Baade (1951) in the center
of NGC 185 are discussed using new CCD images in $B$ and Baade's original
photographic plates, reaching the conclusion that most of them are in fact star
clusters. A consistent picture arises in which the gas observed in the central
region of NGC 185 would have an internal origin. The rate at which evolved
stars return gas to the ISM is enough to seed the recent star formation
observed in the center of the galaxy and the SN rate is probably low enough to
allow the galaxy to retain the gas not used in the new stellar generations.

rotators with the initially split-monopole magnetic field are valid for the
oblique rotators as well. Rotational losses of the oblique rotator do not
depend on the inclination angle and there is no temporal evolution of this
angle. Self-consistent analytical and numerical solutions for the axisymmetric
plasma flows obtained earlier show that the rotators can be divided on fast
rotators ($\sigma_0/U_0^2 > 1$) and slow rotators ($\sigma_0/U_0^2 < 1$), where
$\sigma_0$ is the ratio of the Poynting flux to the matter energy flux in the
flow at the equator on the surface of the star, $U_0 = \gamma_0v_0/c$, $v_0$

self-consistent approximate analytical solution for the plasma flow from the

explaining the absence of post-T Tauri stars in the region with ages $\gtrsim

molecular gas show many features (broad asymmetric profiles, velocity shifts of
H I relative to $^{12}$CO) predicted by our MHD numerical simulations, in which
large-scale H I streams collide to produce dense filamentary structures. This
rapid evolution is possible because the H I flows producing and disrupting the
cloud have much higher velocities (5-10 kms) than present in the molecular gas
resulting from the colliding flows. The simulations suggest that such flows can
occur from the global ISM turbulence without requiring a single triggering
event such as a SN explosion.

complicating the formalism. On the contrary, downfolding is now more efficient
and the formalism is simpler and closer to that of screened multiple-scattering
theory. The NMTO method allows one to solve the single-electron Schroedinger
equation for a MT-potential -in which the MT-wells may overlap- using basis
sets which are arbitrarily minimal. The substantial increase in accuracy over
the LMTO-ASA method is achieved by substitution of the energy-dependent partial
waves by so-called kinked partial waves, which have tails attached to them, and
by using these kinked partial waves at N+1 arbitrary energies to construct the
set of NMTOs. For N=1 and the two energies chosen infinitesimally close, the
NMTOs are simply the 3rd-generation LMTOs. Increasing N, widens the energy
window, inside which accurate results are obtained, and increases the range of
the orbitals, but it does not increase the size of the basis set and therefore
does not change the number of bands obtained. The price for reducing the size
of the basis set through downfolding, is a reduction in the number of bands
accounted for and -unless N is increased- a narrowing of the energy window
inside which these bands are accurate. A method for obtaining orthonormal NMTO
sets is given and several applications are presented.

discuss the implications of recent data (including 708--day data
Super--Kamiokande data) which strongly indicate the need for neutrino
conversions to account for the solar and atmospheric neutrino observations. I
also mention the LSND data, which provides an intriguing hint. The simplest
ways to reconcile all these data in terms of neutrino oscillations invoke a
light sterile neutrino in addition to the three active ones. Out of the four
neutrinos, two are maximally-mixed and lie at the LSND scale, while the others
are at the solar mass scale. These schemes can be distinguished at
neutral-current-sensitive solar & atmospheric neutrino experiments. I discuss
the simplest theoretical scenarios, where the lightness of the sterile
neutrino, the nearly maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing, and the generation of
$\Delta {m^2}_\odot$ & $\Delta {m^2}_{atm}$ all follow naturally from the
assumed lepton-number symmetry and its breaking. Although the most likely
interpretation of the present data is in terms of neutrino-mass-induced
oscillations, one still has room for alternative explanations, such as flavour
changing neutrino interactions, with no need for neutrino mass or mixing. Such
flavour violating transitions arise in theories with strictly massless
neutrinos, and may lead to other sizeable flavour non-conservation effects,
such as $\mu \to e + \gamma$, $\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei, unaccompanied by
neutrino-less double beta decay.

non leptonic weak decays, and its generalization to finite temperature might be
useful in evaluating thermal effects in these processes. As an application we
compute the \pi^+-\pi^0 mass difference at T\neq 0; at small T we reproduce the
behaviour found by other authors: \delta m^2(T)= \delta
m^2(0)+\mathcal{O}(\alpha T^2), while for moderate T, near the deconfinement

neutrinoless double $\beta$-decay could possibly be discovered in the near

determined. In the other four-neutrino scheme (Scheme B) there is an upper
bound on $|< m >|$ of the order of $10^{-2}$ eV. In the case of three-neutrino
mixing the same is true if the neutrino mass spectrum is hierarchical, however,
if there exist two quasi-degenerate neutrinos and the first neutrino has a much
smaller mass, values of $|< m >|$ as large as $\sim 0.1$ eV are possible.

corrections can be summed to all orders in the background process $\gamma
\gamma \longrightarrow q \bar{q}$, $q=\{b,c\}$, from an initially polarized
$J_z=0$ state. In addition, running coupling corrections were included exactly
to all orders by employing the renormalization group. Thus all necessary
theoretical results for calculating the Higgs signal and the non-Higgs
continuum background contributions to the process $\gamma \gamma

the first time precise predictions for the measurement of the partial width

between signal and background is very sensitive to the experimental cuts and
the ability of the detectors to identify $b$-quarks in the final state. We
investigate this in some detail using a Monte Carlo analysis, and conclude that
a measurement with a 2 % statistical accuracy should be achievable. This could
have important consequences for the discovery of physics beyond the Standard

quantum frequencies are 0.124, 32.6, and 227 Zhz, respectively. By explaining
how these particles acquire phase at different rates, we explain why these
particles have different masses. Any free particle spin 1/2 wave function is a
sum of plane waves with spin parallel to velocity. Each plane wave, a pair of
2-component rotation eigenvectors, can be associated with a 2x2 matrix
representation of rotations in a Euclidean space without disturbing the plane
wave's space-time properties. In a space with more than four dimensions, only
rotations in a 4d subspace can be represented. So far all is well known. Now
consider that unrepresented rotations do not have eigenvectors, do not make
plane waves, and do not contribute phase. The particles e, $\pi,$ and p are
assigned rotations in a 4d subspace of 16d, rotations in an 8d subspace of 12d,
and rotations in a 12d subspace of 12d, respectively. The electron 4d subspace,
assumed to be as likely to align with any one 4d subspace as with any other,
produces phase when aligned with the represented 4d subspace in 16d. Similarly,
we calculate the likelihood that a 4d subspace of the pion's 8d space aligns
with the represented 4d subspace in 12d. The represented 4d subspace is
contained in the proton's 12d space, so the proton always acquires phase. By
the relationship between mass and phase, the resulting particle phase ratios
are the particle mass ratios and these are coincident with the measured mass

Submitted for publication","Int.J.Mod.Phys. B13 (1999) 3087-3106","10.1142/S0217979299002873",,"quant-ph cond-mat nlin.SI",,"  Dynamical symmetries of Hamiltonians quantized models of discrete non-linear
Schroedinger chain (DNLS) and of Ablowitz-Ladik chain (AL) are studied. It is
shown that for $n$-sites the dynamical algebra of DNLS Hamilton operator is
given by the $su(n)$ algebra, while the respective symmetry for the AL case is
the quantum algebra su_q(n). The q-deformation of the dynamical symmetry in the
AL model is due to the non-canonical oscillator-like structure of the raising
and lowering operators at each site.
  Invariants of motions are found in terms of Casimir central elements of su(n)
and su_q(n) algebra generators, for the DNLS and QAL cases respectively.
Utilizing the representation theory of the symmetry algebras we specialize to
the $n=2$ quantum dimer case and formulate the eigenvalue problem of each dimer
as a non-linear (q)-spin model. Analytic investigations of the ensuing
three-term non-linear recurrence relations are carried out and the respective
orthonormal and complete eigenvector bases are determined.
  The quantum manifestation of the classical self-trapping in the QDNLS-dimer
and its absence in the QAL-dimer, is analysed by studying the asymptotic
attraction and repulsion respectively, of the energy levels versus the strength
of non-linearity. Our treatment predicts for the QDNLS-dimer, a
phase-transition like behaviour in the rate of change of the logarithm of
eigenenergy differences, for values of the non-linearity parameter near the
classical bifurcation point.

considered in an EPR-type arrangement. On each side the Kochen-Specker
observables $\{J_1^2,J_2^2,J_3^2\}$ and $\{\bar J_1^2, \bar J_2^2,J_3^2\}$ with
$[J_1^2,\bar J_1^2]\neq 0$ are measured. The outcomes of measurements of
$J_3^2$ (via $J_1^2,J_2^2$) and $J_3^2$ (via $\bar J_1^2,\bar J_2^2$) are
compared. Although formally $J_3^2$ is associated with the same projection
operator, a strong form of quantum contextuality states that an outcome depends
on the complete disposition of the measurement apparatus, in particular whether
$J_1^2$ or $\bar J_1^2$ is measured alongside. It is argued that in this case
it is impossible to measure contextuality directly, a necessary condition being
a non-operational counterfactuality of the argument.
