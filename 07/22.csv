high mass X-ray binary Vela X-1 (4U 0900-40) using archival data from ASCA. The
observation covers a time interval centered on eclipse of the X-ray pulsar by
the companion. The spectrum exhibits two distinct sets of discrete features:
(1) recombination lines and radiative recombination continua from mostly H- and
He-like species produced by photoionization in an extended stellar wind; and
(2) fluorescent K-shell lines associated with near-neutral species also present
in the circumsource medium. Using a detailed spectral model that explicitly
accounts for the recombination cascade kinetics for each of the constituent
charge states, we are able to obtain a statistically acceptable (chi_r^2=0.88)
fit to the observed spectrum and to derive emission measures associated with
the individual K-shell ions of several elements. We find a best-fit mass loss
rate of ~2.7 x 10^-7 M-solar/yr, which is approximately a factor of 10 lower
than previous estimates of the mass loss rate for the Vela X-1 companion star,
which have primarily been determined from P Cygni profiles, and X-ray
absorption measurements. We argue that this discrepancy can be reconciled if
the X-ray irradiated portion of the wind in Vela X-1 is structurally
inhomogeneous, consisting of hundreds of cool, dense clumps embedded in a
hotter, more ionized gas. Most of the mass is contained in the clumps, while
most of the wind volume (>95%) is occupied by the highly ionized component. We
show quantitatively, that this interpretation is also consistent with the
presence of the X-ray fluorescent lines in the ASCA spectrum, which are
produced in the cooler, clumped component.

in the form of cold, primordial fractal clouds, as envisioned by Pfenniger,
Combes, & Martinet (1994) and Pfenniger & Combes (1994). We show that, after a
Hubble Time, primordial fractal clouds will convert most of their HI to H2, but
a small fraction of HI remains which is optically thick. This opens up a new
window for detecting dark matter which may exist in this form. The
detectability of such gas depends on its filling factor and temperature and
therefore should be observable in absorption against a background source, with
observations of sufficient sensitivity and resolution. The current VLA
observations have made a first step towards this goal by taking advantage of a
fortuitous alignment between the extension of the HI disk of the nearby galaxy,
NGC 3079, and a background quasar Q 0957+561. Our observations probe 28
independent beams against the quasar and all of velocity space between the
extension of a flat rotation curve and a Keplerian decline for the halo region
of NGC 3079. We do not detect any absorption features and investigate, in
detail, the implication of this result for the hypothesis that dark matter is
in the form of fractal clouds. While our analysis does not rule out fractal
clouds as dark matter, it does lay out the groundwork for future, more
sensitive observations and we consider what form these might take to probe the
range of possible cloud properties more deeply. It is interesting that the
observations can rule out cold optically thin HI gas, if it exists, to a limit
of 0.001% of the dark matter. In contrast, the existence of cold HI in a
fractal hierarchy would be an efficient way of hiding dark matter.

models that successfully reproduce the properties of local X-ray clusters and
groups require the presence of a minimum value for the entropy in the center of
X-ray halos. Such a minimum entropy is most likely generated by
non-gravitational processes, in order to produce the observed break in
self-similarity of the scaling relations of X-ray halos. At present there is no
consensus on the level, the source or the time evolution of this excess
entropy. In this paper we describe a strategy to investigate the physics of the
heating processes acting in groups and clusters. We show that the best way to
extract information from the local data is the observation of the entropy
profile at large radii in nearby X-ray halos (z~0.1), both at the upper and
lower extremes of the cluster mass scale. The spatially and spectrally resolved
observation of such X-ray halos provides information on the mechanism of the
heating. We demonstrate how measurements of the size of constant entropy
(adiabatic) cores in clusters and groups can directly constrain heating models,
and the minimum entropy value. We also consider two specific experiments: the
detection of the shock fronts expected at the virial boundary of rich clusters,
and the detection of the isentropic, low surface-brightness emission extending
to radii larger than the virial ones in low mass clusters and groups. Such
observations will be a crucial probe of both the physics of clusters and the
relationship of non-gravitational processes to the thermodynamics of the
intergalactic medium.

AGN is emitted from an optically thick medium we find an expression for the
characteristic energy of the ``UV bump'' in terms of the observable luminosity
and emission-line width. We show empirically and analytically that the bump
energy is anti-correlated with the black-hole mass and with the continuum
luminosity. Our model reproduces the observed inverse correlation between
equivalent width and continuum luminosity, yielding an explanation of the
Baldwin effect from first principles. The model gives a good fit to the Baldwin
Effect of the CIV line for a mean quasar EUV spectrum (Zheng et al. 1997) and

during the observations, the presence of VLFN and HFN in the power spectra, and
the high intrinsic X-ray luminosity of LMC X-2 (which historically spans

characteristic of a Z-source in its flaring branch than of an atoll-source. On
this basis, we provisionally reclassify LMC X-2 as a Z-source, the eighth such
source known and the first to be detected beyond our Galaxy.
  Using periodogram and Fourier analysis of the X-ray lightcurve we detect an
apparently-significant modulation with a period of 8.160+/-0.011 hrs and a
semi-amplitude increasing from 14% in the 1.8-4.0 keV range to 40% at 8.7-19.7

determined from optical photometry ten years prior to our campaign, but we

light curves and archival EXOSAT observations show no sign of such a pronounced
periodicity.

Comptonization models. Fits to phase(=intensity)-resolved spectra show strong

clear image of the electron-phonon interaction is revealed. The observed
structure in the current voltage characteristics at the phonon energies can be
used to measure, through inversion of the Eliashberg equations, the electron
phonon spectral density \alpha^2F(\omega). The coherence length in conventional
materials is long and the tunneling process probes several atomic layers into
the bulk of the superconductor. On the contrary, in the high-T_c oxides,
particularly for c-axis tunneling, the coherence length can be quite short and
in an optical experiment or in neutron scattering experiments the bulk of the
sample is probed. Therefore, these spectroscopies become the methods of choice
for the investigation of mechanisms of high-T_c superconductivity. Accurate
reflectance measurements in the infrared range and precise polarized neutron
scattering data are available for a variety of oxides. In this paper we show
that conducting carriers studied by means of infrared spectroscopy reveal
strong coupling to a resonance structure in the spectrum of spin fluctuations
examined with neutron scattering. The coupling strength inferred from
experiment is sufficient to account for high values of T_c which signals the
prominent role of spin excitations in the superconductivity of oxides.

coherence length xi(T) have a critical temperature T_c, oscillating as a
function of the applied perpendicular magnetic field H (or flux Phi). For a
thin-wire superconducting loop, the oscillations in T_c are perfectly periodic
with H (this is the well-known Little-Parks effect), while for a singly
connected superconducting disk the oscillations are pseudoperiodic, i.e. the
magnetic period decreases as H grows. In the present paper, we study the
intermediate case: a loop made of thick wires. By increasing the size of the
opening in the middle, the disk-like behaviour of T_c(H) with a quasi-linear
background (characteristic for '3-dimensional' (3D) behaviour) is shown to
evolve into a parabolic T_c(H) background ('2D'), superimposed with perfectly
periodic oscillations. The calculations are performed using the linearized
Ginzburg-Landau theory, with the proper normal/vacuum boundary conditions at
both the internal and the external interface. Above a certain crossover
magnetic flux Phi, T_c(Phi) of the loops becomes quasi-linear, and the flux
period matches with the case of the filled disk. This dimensional transition is
similar to the 2D-3D transition for thin films in a parallel magnetic field,
where vortices enter the material as soon as the film thickness t > 1.8 xi(T).
For the loops studied here, the crossover point appears for w = 1.8 xi(T) as
well, with w the width of the wires forming the loop. In the 3D regime, a
""giant vortex state"" establishes, where superconductivity is concentrated near
the sample's outer interface. The vortex is then localized inside the loop's
opening.

steadily sedimenting through a viscous fluid. The problem involves two coupled
fields, the density and the tilt; the latter describes the orientation of the
mass tensor with respect to the driving field. We map the problem to a 1-d
lattice model with two coupled species of spins evolving through conserved
dynamics. In the steady state of this model each of the two species shows
macroscopic phase separation. This phase separation is robust and survives at
all temperatures or noise levels--- hence the term Strong Phase Separation.
This sort of phase separation can be understood in terms of barriers to
remixing which grow with system size and result in a logarithmically slow
approach to the steady state. In a particular symmetric limit, it is shown that
the condition of detailed balance holds with a Hamiltonian which has
infinite-ranged interactions, even though the initial model has only local
dynamics. The long-ranged character of the interactions is responsible for
phase separation, and for the fact that it persists at all temperatures.
Possible experimental tests of the phenomenon are discussed.

breaking effects. For the 3-SAT problem, we find two transitions as the ratio
$\alpha$ of logical clauses per Boolean variables increases. At the first one
$\alpha_s \simeq 3.96$, a non-trivial organization of the solution space in
geometrically separated clusters emerges. The multiplicity of these clusters as
well as the typical distances between different solutions are calculated. At
the second threshold $\alpha_c \simeq 4.48$, satisfying assignments disappear
and a finite fraction $B_0 \simeq 0.13$ of variables are overconstrained and
take the same values in all optimal (though unsatisfying) assignments. These

approach, the SAT-UNSAT transition naturally appears as a mixture of a first

finite size effects are implemented through a Van der Waals like correction in
the normalization of the baryon fields. In this approach we investigate
$\beta$-stable matter in conditions that could be found in the interior of

significantly for densities above twice the symmetric nuclear matter saturation
density, although for the quark model the results strongly depends upon the
