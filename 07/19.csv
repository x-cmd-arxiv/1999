investigated. The distribution of rich superclusters is not isotropic: along
the main axis of the network it is periodic with a step of length about 130 Mpc

sigma_R) of self-gravitating bodies in various disc potentials is investigated
through two different numerical methods (statistical compilation of two-body
encounters and N-body simulations). The velocity dispersion generated by
two-body relaxation is considered. The ratio is given as a function of a disc
potential parameter, kappa/Omega, where kappa and Omega are the epicycle and
circular frequencies (the parameters kappa/Omega=1 and 2 correspond to Kepler
rotation and solid-body rotation). For 1 <= kappa/Omega <~ 1.5, the velocity
dispersion increases keeping some anisotropy (sigma_z / sigma_R ~ 0.5-0.7) if
the amplitude of radial excursion is larger than tidal radius, while sigma_z /
sigma_R << 1 for smaller amplitude. On the other hand, for 1.5 <~ kappa/Omega
<= 2.0, we found isotropic state (sigma_z / sigma_R ~ 1) in the intermediate
velocity regime, while anisotropic state (sigma_z / sigma_R < 1) still exists
for higher and lower velocity regimes. The range of the intermediate velocity
regime expands with kappa/Omega. In the limit of solid-body rotation, the
regime covers all over the velocity space. Thus, the velocity dispersion
generally has two different anisotropic states for each disc potential (1 <=
kappa/Omega < 2) and one isotropic state for 1.5 <~ kappa/Omega < 2 where the
individual states correspond to different amplitude of velocity dispersion,
while in the limit of solid-body rotation (kappa/Omega = 2.0), entire velocity

simplifying assumptions. In this paper, we test the reliability of these

simulations through a cosmological density field generated by very large N-body

the non-linear evolution of the matter distribution, such as the dispersion of
the aperture mass and the halo abundance, are surprisingly accurately
reproduced with our numerical results, whereas the predictions for the
skewness, based on quasi-linear theory, are rather imprecise. In particular, we
verify numerically that the probability distribution of the aperture mass
decreases exponentially for values much larger than the rms. Given the good
overall agreement, comparisons between the observed distribution of the
aperture mass and the theoretical values provide a powerful tool for testing
cosmological models.

conventional geometric algorithms, has been seriously challenged in recent
years, since digital computers do not exhibit such capability.
  A geometric predicate usually consists of evaluating the sign of some
algebraic expression. In most cases, rounded computations yield a reliable
result, but sometimes rounded arithmetic introduces errors which may invalidate
the algorithms. The rounded arithmetic may produce an incorrect result only if
the exact absolute value of the algebraic expression is smaller than some
(small) varepsilon, which represents the largest error that may arise in the
evaluation of the expression. The threshold varepsilon depends on the structure
of the expression and on the adopted computer arithmetic, assuming that the
input operands are error-free.
  A pair (arithmetic engine,threshold) is an ""arithmetic filter"". In this paper
we develop a general technique for assessing the efficacy of an arithmetic
filter. The analysis consists of evaluating both the threshold and the
probability of failure of the filter.
  To exemplify the approach, under the assumption that the input points be
chosen randomly in a unit ball or unit cube with uniform density, we analyze
the two important predicates ""which-side"" and ""insphere"". We show that the
probability that the absolute values of the corresponding determinants be no
larger than some positive value V, with emphasis on small V, is Theta(V) for
the which-side predicate, while for the insphere predicate it is Theta(V^(2/3))
in dimension 1, O(sqrt(V)) in dimension 2, and O(sqrt(V) ln(1/V)) in higher
dimensions. Constants are small, and are given in the paper.

However, the angular smearing introduced by the experimental inability of
detecting recoils in neutrino interactions with nuclei is large enough to wash
out, in practice, most of the differences between 3-dimensional and

of B-DNA duplexes can be obtained in relatively inexpensive computational
conditions with the bulk solvent represented implicitly, but the minor groove
filled with explicit water (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998, 120, 10928). The present
paper further explores these simulation conditions in order to understand the
main factors responsible for the observed surprisingly good agreement with
experimental data. It appears that in the case of the EcoRI dodecamer certain
sequence specific hydration patterns in the minor groove earlier known from
experimental data are formed spontaneously in the course of MD simulations. The
effect is reliably reproduced in several independent computational experiments
in different simulation conditions. With all major groove water removed,
closely similar results are obtained, with even better reproducibility. On the
other hand, without explicit hydration, metastable dynamics around a B-DNA like
state can be obtained which, however, only poorly compares with experimental
data. It appears, therefore, that a right-handed DNA helix with explicitly
hydrated minor groove is a minimal model system where the experimental
properties of B-DNA can be reproduced with non-trivial sequence-dependent
effects. Its small size makes possible virtually exhaustive sampling, which is
a major advantage with respect to alternative approaches. An appendix is
included with a correction to the implicit leapfrog integrator used in internal
coordinate MD.
