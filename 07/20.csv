the formation of a hierarchical rule to determine the dynamics of the
functional value. To study the periodic (or non-fixed) solution, the functional
dynamics is separated into fixed and non-fixed parts. It is shown that the
fixed parts generate a 1-dimensional map by which the dynamics of the
functional values of some other parts are determined. Piecewise-linear maps
with multiple branches are generally created, while an arbitrary
one-dimensional map can be embedded into this functional dynamics if the
initial function coincides with the identity function over a finite interval.
Next, the dynamics determined by the one-dimensional map can again generate a
`meta-map', which determines the dynamics of the generated map. This hierarchy
of meta-rules can continue recursively. It is also shown that the dynamics can
produce `meta-chaos' with an orbital instability that is stronger than
exponential. The relevance of the generated hierarchy to biological and
language systems is discussed, in relation with the formation of syntax of a
network.

The model is a dynamical system of a function $f$, not of variables, having a

biological system is often applied to itself, as is typically seen in rules in
the natural language or genes. Starting from an inarticulate network, two types
of fixed points are formed as an invariant structure with iterations. The
function is folded with time, until it has finite or infinite piecewise-flat
segments of fixed points, regarded as articulation. For an initial logistic
map, attracted functions are classified into step, folded step, fractal, and
random phases, according to the degree of folding. Oscillatory dynamics are

  Using the time delays determined by Fassnacht et al. (1999a), we find that
the best isothermal mass model gives H_0=59^{+7}_{-6} km/s/Mpc for Omega_m=1

three other gravitational lens systems (i.e. B0218+357, Q0957+561 and
PKS1830-211), SNe Ia, the S-Z effect and local determinations. The current
agreement on H_0 from four out of five gravitational lens systems (i)
emphasizes the reliability of its determination from isolated gravitational
lens systems and (ii) suggests that a close-to-isothermal mass profile can
describe disk galaxies, ellipticals and central cluster ellipticals.

component of stars older than 4 Gyr is required to match the observed

relation are unable to reproduce the width of the observed main sequence;
models with a range of metallicity at a given age provide a much better fit.
Such models allow us to construct complete ``population boxes'' for the LMC
based entirely on color-magnitude diagrams; remarkably, these qualitatively
reproduce the age-metallicity relation observed in LMC clusters. We discuss
some of the uncertainties in deriving star formation histories. We find,
independently of the models, that the LMC bar field has a larger relative
component of older stars than the outer fields. The main implications suggested
by this study are: 1) the star formation history of field stars appears to
differ from the age distribution of clusters, 2) there is no obvious evidence
for bursty star formation, but our ability to measure bursts shorter in
duration than $\sim$ 25% of any given age is limited by the statistics of the
observed number of stars, 3) there may be some correlation of the star
formation rate with the last close passage of the LMC/SMC/Milky Way, but there
is no dramatic effect, and 4) the derived star formation history is probably
consistent with observed abundances, based on recent chemical evolution models.

was measured with the narrow-field instruments on BeppoSAX on April 6 and 7,
1997. The spectrum is consistent with the Comptonization of a 0.6 keV thermal
spectrum by a hot cloud of temperature equivalent kT=20 keV. During the
observation two type I X-ray bursts were detected. From the bursts an upper
limit to the distance could be derived of 8 kpc. Combined with an elsewhere
determined lower limit of 4 kpc this implies a persistent X-ray luminosity
between 3.5 X 10^36 and 1.4 X 10^37 erg/s which is fairly typical for a LMXB
X-ray burster. The accurate determination of the energetics of the two bursts
and the persistent emission confirm results with the Wide Field Cameras on
BeppoSAX in a narrower bandpass (Ubertini et al. 1999). Comparison with
independent X-ray measurements taken at other times indicates that GS 1826-238
since its turn-on in 1988 is a rather stable accretor, which is in line with
the strong regularity of type I X-ray bursts.

proportional to L_{B_j}^{1.2--1.3}. We verify the robustness of this relation

moderately strong vertical (poloidal) magnetic field. Its mechanism is such
that a spiral density wave in the disk, driven by magnetic stresses (rather
than self-gravity as in galactic spirals), becomes unstable by exchanging
angular momentum with a Rossby vortex it generates at its corotation radius.
This angular momentum can then ``leak'' as Alfven waves emitted toward the
corona of the disk thus providing, as an element of the accretion process, an
energetic source for a wind or a jet. As galactic spirals, this instability
forms low azimuthal wavenumber, standing spiral patterns which might provide an

reported by Noheda et al. for the composition x= 0.48. In the present work,
samples with Ti contents of x= 0.47 and 0.50, which are both tetragonal below
their Curie points, have been investigated. In the sample with x= 0.50, the
tetragonal phase was found to transform to a monoclinic phase at about 200 K as
the temperature was lowered. The sample with x= 0.47 showed a complicated
region of phase coexistence between 440-320 K, becoming rhombohedral at around
300 K. No further symmetry change was found down to 20 K. Dielectric
measurements for these two samples are also reported. On the basis of these
results, a preliminary phase diagram is presented. Optimum compositional
homogeneity is needed to properly characterize the new monoclinic region.

Hall-effect and Shubnikov-de Haas measurements show that the electron densities
reached are higher than for other delta-dopants, like Si and Be. The maximum
carrier density determined by the Hall effect equals 8.4x10^13 cm^-2. For all

population of multiple subbands. The depopulation fields of the subbands were
determined by measuring the magnetoresistance with the magnetic field in the
plane of the delta-layer. The experimental results are in good agreement with
selfconsistent bandstructure calculations. These calculation shows that in the
sample with the highest electron density also the conduction band at the L

applied in particular to de Sitter horizons, and leads to a picture of the

micro-causality emerges, where the time parameter is being defined by the
discrete increase of entropy. Then, the model is analysed in the framework of
the theory of presheaves (varying sets on a causal set) and we get a quantum
history. A (bosonic) Fock space of the whole history is considered. The Fock

TeV or less). Additional interactions coming from the underlying theory, and
suppressed by the scale Lambda, give rise to model-dependent corrections to
precisely measured electroweak quantities. Dimension six operators arising from
the underlying physics naturally contribute to the S and T parameters, and
their effects should be included in a global fit to the precision data that
determines any limit on the Higgs mass. Using dimensional analysis, we estimate
the expected size of these corrections in a custodially-symmetric
strongly-interacting underlying theory. Taking these operators' coefficients to
be of natural size gives sufficiently large contributions to the T parameter to
reconcile Higgs masses as large as 400-500 GeV with the precision data.

B_c formation in deconfined and confined matter. Our initial calculations
suggest that: (a) The rates of normal hadronic production mechanisms at RHIC
energies are not sufficient to produce a detectable number of B_c mesons, (b)
If a region of deconfined quarks and gluons is formed, the production (and
survival) rate can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude, and (c) The
observation of B_c mesons at RHIC would signal a source of deconfined charmed

to 3d and 4d, in the form of field theories over group manifolds. We show that
the Barrett-Crane quantum gravity model arises naturally from a theory of this
type, but restricted to the homogeneous space S^3=SO(4)/SO(3), as a term in its
Feynman expansion. From such a perspective, 4d quantum spacetime emerges as a
Feynman graph, in the manner of the 2d matrix models. This formalism provides a
precise meaning to the ``sum over triangulations'', which is presumably
necessary for a physical interpretation of a spin foam model as a theory of
gravity. In addition, this formalism leads us to introduce a natural
alternative model, which might have relevance for quantum gravity.

which are self-adjoint. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. This is
because, in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, an operator is not necessarily
self-adjoint even if its expectation values are real. Instead, the operator may
be merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable - and as a
consequence they describe real degrees of freedom which display a form of
""unsharpness"" or ""fuzzyness"". For example, there are indications that this type
of operators could arise with the description of space-time at the string or at
the Planck scale, where some form of unsharpness or fuzzyness has long been
conjectured.
  A priori, however, a potential problem with merely symmetric operators is the
fact that, unlike self-adjoint operators, they do not generate unitaries - at
least not straightforwardly. Here, we show for a large class of these operators
that they do generate unitaries in a well defined way, and that these operators
even generate the entire unitary group of the Hilbert space. This shows that
merely symmetric operators, in addition to describing unsharp physical
entities, may indeed also play a r{\^o}le in the generation of symmetries, e.g.
within a fundamental theory of quantum gravity.

  Indian National Science Academy",,,"SBNC/99-07-01","hep-th hep-lat",,"  The role of the contribution from the fermion mass term in the axial vector
Ward identity in generating the U(1) axial anomaly, both local and global, is
elucidated. Gauge invariance requires the fermion to decouple from the gauge
field if it is very heavy. This identifies the Adler-Bell-Jackiw (ABJ) anomaly
with the asymptotic limit of the sign reversed mass term. In an instanton
background, the chiral limit $(m = 0)$ of the mass term does not vanish but
consists of contributions from fermion zero modes. Space time integral of these
zero mode contributions exactly cancels, thanks to the Atiyah-Singer index
theorem, the integral of the ABJ anomaly and suggests that the Jacobian for
global U(1) chiral transformation is trivial even in an instanton background.
This can be realised in the representation of the fermion partition function in
a Weyl basis. The resolution of the strong CP problem is thus achieved in an
axionless physical world. In chiral gauge theories the fermion partition
function admits of a gauge invariant representation but only at the cost of
locality. Implementation of fermion averaging of the gauge current with the
invariant partition function yields the current whose covariant derivative is
the covariant anomaly. With the covariant current as input one can derive an
integrable current whose covariant derivative is the minimal consistent anomaly
obeying the Wess-Zumino consistency condition. The distinction between the two
currents disappears if either the covariant or the consistent anomaly vanishes.
This is realised only if the fermion belongs to an anomaly-free representation
of the gauge group.

to a homomorphism from the K-theory of this C^*-algebra to the real numbers.
This paper addresses the range of this homomorphism. For torsion free groups,
the Baum-Connes conjecture and Atiyah's L2-index theorem implies that the range
consists of the integers. If the group is not torsion free, Baum and Connes
conjecture that the trace takes values in the rational numbers.
  We give a direct and elementary proof that if G acts on a tree and admits a
homomorphism \alpha to another group H whose restriction to every stabilizer
group of a vertex is injective, then the range of the trace for G,
tr_G(K(C_r^*G)) is contained in the range of the trace for H, tr_H(K(C_r^*H)).

  equality added in Eq.(16)","Phys.Rev.A61:024102,2000","10.1103/PhysRevA.61.024102",,"quant-ph",,"  For a time-dependent $\tau$-periodic harmonic oscillator of two linearly
independent homogeneous solutions of classical equation of motion which are
bounded all over the time (stable), it is shown, there is a representation of
states cyclic up to multiplicative constants under $\tau$-evolution or
$2\tau$-evolution depending on the model. The set of the wave functions is
complete. Berry's phase which could depend on the choice of representation can
be defined under the $\tau$- or $2\tau$-evolution in this representation. If a
homogeneous solution diverges as the time goes to infinity, it is shown that,
Berry's phase can not be defined in any representation considered. Berry's
phase for the driven harmonic oscillator is also considered. For the cases
where Berry's phase can be defined, the phase is given in terms of solutions of
the classical equation of motion.
