provided insight into how improved performance on a task requiring global
coordination emerges when only local interactions are possible. Two approaches
that can affect the search efficiency of the genetic algorithm are coevolution,
in which a population of problems---in our case, initial configurations of the
CA lattice---evolves along with the population of CAs; and resource sharing, in
which a greater proportion of a limited fitness resource is assigned to those
CAs which correctly solve problems that fewer other CAs in the population can
solve. Here we present evidence that, in contrast to what has been suggested
elsewhere, the improvements observed when both techniques are used together
depend largely on resource sharing alone.

  in Theoretical Population Biology, 2001",,,,"adap-org nlin.AO q-bio",,"  We revisit the classical population genetics model of a population evolving
under multiplicative selection, mutation and drift. The number of beneficial
alleles in a multi-locus system can be considered a trait under exponential
selection. Equations of motion are derived for the cumulants of the trait
distribution in the diffusion limit and under the assumption of linkage
equilibrium. Because of the additive nature of cumulants, this reduces to the
problem of determining equations of motion for the expected allele distribution
cumulants at each locus. The cumulant equations form an infinite dimensional
linear system and in an authored appendix Adam Prugel-Bennett provides a closed
form expression for these equations. We derive approximate solutions which are
shown to describe the dynamics well for a broad range of parameters. In
particular, we introduce two approximate analytical solutions: (1) Perturbation
theory is used to solve the dynamics for weak selection and arbitrary mutation
rate. The resulting expansion for the system's eigenvalues reduces to the known
diffusion theory results for the limiting cases with either mutation or
selection absent. (2) For low mutation rates we observe a separation of
time-scales between the slowest mode and the rest which allows us to develop an
approximate analytical solution for the dominant slow mode. The solution is
consistent with the perturbation theory result and provides a good
approximation for much stronger selection intensities.

Such encounters may explain the observed paucity of highly luminous red giants
within the central 0.2pc. The masses of the missing stars are likely to be in
the range 2 to 8 solar masses. Recent models of the galactic centre cluster's
density and velocity distributions are used to calculate two-body collision
rates. In particular we use stellar-evolution models to calculate the number of
collisions a star will have during different evolutionary phases. We find that
the number of two-body collisions per star is $\lo 1$ in the central 0.1 to 0.2
pc, depending strongly on the galactocentric radius. Using a 3D numerical
hydrodynamics code (SPH) we simulate encounters involving cluster stars of
various masses with 2 and 8 solar-mass red giants. The instantaneous mass loss
in such collisions is rarely enough to destroy either giant. A fraction of the
collisions do, however, lead to the formation of common envelope systems where
the impactor and giant's core are enshrouded by the envelope of the giant. Such
systems may evolve to expel the envelope, leaving a tight binary; the original
giant is destroyed. The fraction of collisions that produce common envelope
systems is sensitive to the local velocity dispersion and hence galactocentric
radius. Using our collision-rate calculations we compute the time-scales for a
giant star to suffer such a collision within the galactic centre. These
time-scales are >10^{9-10}years and so are longer than the lifetimes of stars
more-massive than 2 solar masses. Thus the observed paucity of luminous giants
is unlikely to be due to the formation of common envelope systems as a result
of two-body encounters involving giant stars.

  MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03272.x",,"astro-ph",,"  The modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), suggested by Milgrom as an
alternative to dark matter, implies that isothermal spheres with a fixed
anisotropy parameter should exhibit a near perfect relation between the mass
and the fourth power of the velocity dispersion. This is consistent with the
observed Faber-Jackson relation for elliptical galaxies-- a luminosity-velocity
dispersion relation with large scatter. However, the observable global
properties of elliptical galaxies comprise a three parameter family; they lie
on a ``fundamental plane'' in a logarithmic space consisting of central
velocity dispersion, effective radius, and luminosity. The scatter
perpendicular to this plane is significantly less than that about the
Faber-Jackson relation. I show here that, in order to match the observed global
properties of elliptical galaxies with MOND, models must deviate from being
strictly isothermal and isotropic; such objects can be approximated by
high-order polytropic spheres with a radial orbit anisotropy in the outer
regions. MOND imposes boundary conditions on the inner Newtonian regions which
restrict these models to a dynamical fundamental plane which may differ from
that implied by the traditional virial theorem. Scatter about this plane is
relatively insensitive to the necessary deviations from homology.

the symbolic names that are consistent with its knot-theoretic invariants and
with the topological structure of the attractor are first obtained using
template analysis. This information, and the locations of the periodic orbits
in the section plane, are then used to construct a generating partition by
means of triangulations. We provide numerical evidence of the validity of this
method by applying it successfully to sets of more than 1500 periodic orbits
extracted from numerical simulations, and obtain partitions whose border is
localized with a precision of 0.01%. A distinctive advantage of this approach
is that the solution is progressively refined using higher-period orbits, which
makes it robust to noise, and suitable for analyzing experimental time series.
Furthermore, the resulting encodings are by construction consistent in the
corresponding limits with those rigorously known for both one-dimensional and
hyperbolic maps.

techniques. The flows are assumed to be rotational and inviscid, and a new
technique is described to determine the streamfunctions for linear shear
profiles. The geometries considered are the snow cornice and the
backward-facing step, whose edges allow for the separation of the flow and
reattachment downstream of the recirculation regions. A point vortex has been
added to the flows in order to constrain the separation points to be located at
the edges, while the conformal mappings have been modified in order to smooth
the sharp edges and let the separation points be free to oscillate around the
points of maximum curvature. Unsteadiness is imposed on the flow by perturbing
the vortex location, either by displacing the vortex from equilibrium, or by
imposing a random perturbation with zero mean on the vortex in equilibrium. The
trajectories of passive scalars continuously released upwind of the separation
point and trapped by the recirculating bubble are numerically integrated, and
concentration time series are calculated at fixed locations downwind of the
reattachment points. This model proves to be capable of reproducing the
trapping and intermittent release of scalars, in agreement with the simulation
of the flow past a snow cornice performed by a discrete multi-vortex model, as
well as with direct numerical simulations of the flow past a backward-facing

the surface of the macroion. Cohesive energy of this liquid leads to additional
attraction of counterions to the surface which is absent in conventional
solutions of Poisson-Boltzmann equation. Away from the surface this attraction
can be taken into account by a new boundary condition for the concentration of
counterions near the surface. Poisson-Boltzmann equation is solved with this
boundary condition for a charged flat surface, a cylinder and a sphere. In all
three cases, screening is much stronger than in the conventional approach. At
some critical exponentially small concentration of multivalent counterions in
the solution they totally neutralize the surface charge at small distances from
the surface. At larger concentrations they invert the sign the net macroion
charge. Absolute value of the inverted charge density can be as large as 20% of
that of the bare one. In particular, for a cylindrical macroion, it is shown
that for screening by multivalent counterions predictions of the
Onsager-Manning theory are quantitatively incorrect. The net charge density of
the cylinder is smaller than their theory predicts and inverts sign with
growing concentration of counterions. Moreover the condensation looses its
universality and the net charge linear density depends on the bare one.

calculate the effects of the Coulomb interaction upon: i) the subgap Andreev

non-rigid-band behavior of the minority band due to spin fluctuations at finite

context of the heavy top quark, whose large mass may provide a clue as to the
mechanism which generates the mass of the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons. As a result,
it seems quite likely that the top quark may be special in the sense that it is
involved in dynamics not experienced by the light fermions. Examples of this
include models such as the top-condensate model in which a bound state of top
quarks condenses, generating both the top mass and the gauge boson masses, and
supersymmetric models in which the large top Yukawa coupling naturally explains
the EWSB by radiatively driving the squared mass of a scalar particle (which is
positive at a large energy scale) negative at low energies. Specific collider
signatures of the third family result from such scenarios, and can be used to
test the hypothesis that the top plays a role in the EWSB. In particular,
single top production, as a measure of the top's weak interactions, provides an
excellent probe of nonstandard top quark properties. The physics of single top
production at hadron colliders is carefully studied, with a particular eye
towards what can be learned from single top, including the signs of new physics

$\tan \beta \sim 2$ it becomes increasingly important to investigate physical
quantities sensitive to large masses of a pseudoscalar Higgs mass. This regime
is difficult and over a large range of $\tan \beta$ impossible to cover at the
LHC proton proton collider. In this paper we focus on the achievable
statistical precision of the Higgs decay into two photons at a future $\gamma
\gamma$ collider (PLC) in the MSSM mass range below 130 GeV. The MSSM and SM
predictions for $\Gamma (H \longrightarrow \gamma \gamma)$ can differ by up to
10 % even in the decoupling limit of large $m_A$. We summarize recent progress
in both the theoretical understanding of the background process $\gamma \gamma
\longrightarrow q \bar{q}$, $q=\{b,c\}$, and in the expected detector
performance allow for a high accuracy of the lightest MSSM or SM Higgs boson
decay into a $b \bar{b}$ pair. We find that for optimized but still realistic
detector and accelerator assumptions, statistically a 1.4% accuracy is feasible
after about four years of collecting data for a Higgs boson mass which excludes
$\tan \beta <2$.

is discussed quantitatively from a quantum perspective. Exact quantum
expressions for the Fourier components of the density (that include all
spherical aberration) are used to study the focusing numerically. The following
lens parameters and density profiles are calculated as functions of the pulsed
field area $\theta $: the position of the focal plane, peak atomic density,
atomic density pattern at the focus, focal spot size, depth of focus, and
background density. The lens parameters are compared to asymptotic, analytical
results derived from a scalar diffraction theory for which spherical aberration
is small but non-negligible ($\theta \gg 1$). Within the diffraction theory
analytical expressions show that the focused atoms in the far detuned case have
an approximately constant background density $0.5(1-0.635\theta ^{- 1/2})$
while the peak density behaves as $% 3.83\theta ^{1/2}$, the focal distance or
time as $\theta ^{-1}(1+1.27\theta ^{- 1/2})$, the focal spot size as
$0.744\theta ^{-3/4}$, and the depth of focus as $1.91\theta ^{- 3/2}$.
Focusing by the resonant standing wave field leads to a new effect, a Rabi-
like oscillation of the atom density. For the far-detuned lens, chromatic
aberration is studied with the exact Fourier results. Similarly, the
degradation of the focus that results from angular divergence in beams or
thermal velocity distributions in traps is studied quantitatively with the
exact Fourier method and understood analytically using the asymptotic results.
Overall, we show that strong thin lens focusing is possible with modest laser
powers and with currently achievable atomic beam characteristics.

  channel: a two-bit quantum gate for quantum information processing",,,"10.1103/PhysRevA.61.052310",,"quant-ph",,"  An exact reduced-density-operator for the output quantum states in
time-convolutionless form was derived by solving the quantum Liouville equation
which governs the dynamics of a noisy quantum channel by using a projection
operator method and both advanced and retarded propagators in time. The
formalism developed in this work is general enough to model a noisy quantum
channel provided specific forms of the Hamiltonians for the system, reservoir,
and the mutual interaction between the system and the reservoir are given.
Then, we apply the formulation to model a two-bit quantum gate composed of
coupled spin systems in which the Heisenberg coupling is controlled by the
tunneling barrier between neighboring quantum dots. Gate Characteristics
including the entropy, fidelity, and purity are calculated numerically for both
mixed and entangled initial states.
