morphological and physical diagnostic purposes. An unambiguous method for
computing asymmetry is developed, robust for both distant and nearby galaxies.
By degrading real galaxy images, we test the reliability of this asymmetry
measure over a range of observational conditions, e.g. spatial resolution and
signal-to-noise (S/N). Compared to previous methods, this new algorithm avoids
the ambiguity associated with choosing a center by using a minimization method,
and successfully corrects for variations in S/N. There is, however, a strong
relationship between the rotational asymmetry and physical resolution (distance
at fixed spatial resolution); objects become more symmetric when less
well-resolved. We further investigate asymmetry as a function of galactic
radius an rotation. We find the asymmetry index has a strong radial dependence
that differs vastly between Hubble types. As a result, a meaningful asymmetry
index must be specified within a well-defined radius representative of the
physical galaxy scale. We enumerate several viable alternatives, which excludes
the use of isophotes. Asymmetry as a function of angle (A[phi]) is also a
useful indicator of ellipticity and higher-order azimuthal structure. In
general, we show the power of asymmetry as a morphological parameter lies in
the strong correlation with (B-V) color for galaxies undergoing normal star
formation, spanning all Hubble types from ellipticals to irregular galaxies.
Interacting galaxies do not fall on this asymmetry-color ``fiducial sequence,''
as these galaxies are too asymmetric for their color. We propose to use this
fact to distinguish between `normal' galaxies and galaxies undergoing an
interaction or merger at high redshift.

are drawn from two population groups, one from low mass white dwarf secondaries
of close binaries identified with the bulge/thick disk population, and the
other from massive white dwarf secondaries identified with the outer thin
disk/spiral arm population, is discussed. We conclude that the M81 data are
consistent with the two population division as argued previously from (1) the
observational studies on other grounds by Della Valle et al. (1992, 1994),
Della Valle & Livio (1998), and Shafter et al. (1996) of nearby galaxies, (2)

give a nova distance modulus for M81 as $(m-M)_0 = 27.75$, consistent with the

position on the disk about 0.6"" away from the nucleus by Dopita et al. This
enhancement of Ly-alpha at the nucleus could point to significant differences
in the properties of the emitting gas and/or the excitation mechanism between
the outer and inner disk regions. The strength of the observed Ly-alpha places
limits on the properties of the absorbing gas present within M87. For instance,
if the hydrogen column at the systemic velocity of M87 is greater than about
10^18 cm^{-2} then it can cover only a small fraction of the line emitting
region. Spectra separated by 5 days show a 60% difference in the Ly-alpha flux,

between the aperture positions for the two sets of observations, or it could be
due to intrinsic variability of the source. The current observations do not
strongly favor either of these alternatives. The observations do show, however,
that the Ly-alpha line is a useful tracer of kinematics in the M87 nucleus.

difficult to understand with the currently popular ideas about CR origin - e.g.
the small Galacto-centric gradient of the cosmic-ray density and the absence of

close to maximal, and Delta_m^2 approximately equal to 3 E-3 (eV^2). This
interpretation of the data is in potential conflict with the successes of big
bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), since oscillations can result in a too large
contribution of the sterile state to the energy density of the universe at the
epoch of nucleosynthesis. The possibility to evade these cosmological
constraints has been recently the object of some controversy. In this work we
rediscuss this problem and find that the inclusion of a small mixing of the
sterile state with tau neutrino can result in the generation of a large lepton
asymmetry that strongly suppress the muon-sterile neutrino oscillations
eliminating the possible conflict with BBN bounds. In this scheme the mass of
the tau neutrino must be larger than few eV's and is compatible with
cosmological bounds. Our calculation is performed using a Pauli-Boltzmann
method. In this approach it is also possible to develop analytic calculations
that allow physical insight in the processes considered and give support to the

implies that the total (bosonic plus fermionic) mass correction in an N=1
supersymmetric soliton model is determined solely by the asymptotic values (and
derivatives) of the fermionic background potential. For a static soliton the
total mass correction is $-m/(2\pi)$, in agreement with recent analyses using

description of M^7 suggests the gauge group and the supersingleton fields. The
conformal dimensions of the latter can be independently calculated by
comparison with the mass of baryonic operators that correspond to 5-branes
wrapped on supersymmetric 5-cycles and are charged with respect to the Betti
multiplets. The entire Kaluza Klein spectrum of short multiplets agrees with
these dimensions. Furthermore, the metric cone over the Sasakian manifold is a
conifold algebraically embedded in some C^p. The ring of chiral primary fields
is defined as the coordinate ring of C^p modded by the ideal generated by the
embedding equations; this ideal has a nice characterization by means of
representation theory. The entire Kaluza Klein spectrum is explained in terms
of these vanishing relations. We give the superfield interpretation of all

E 61: 2996-3002 (2000)","10.1103/PhysRevE.61.2996",,"physics.bio-ph cond-mat q-bio.MN",,"  We study analytically the steady-state regime of a network of n error-prone
self-replicating templates forming an asymmetric hypercycle and its error tail.
We show that the existence of a master template with a higher non-catalyzed
self-replicative productivity, a, than the error tail ensures the stability of
chains in which m<n-1 templates coexist with the master species. The stability
of these chains against the error tail is guaranteed for catalytic coupling
strengths (K) of order of a. We find that the hypercycle becomes more stable
than the chains only for K of order of a2. Furthermore, we show that the
minimal replication accuracy per template needed to maintain the hypercycle,
the so-called error threshold, vanishes like sqrt(n/K) for large K and n<=4.

  Transmitted and Fluorescent Fields in the Weak Driving Field Limit","10 pages, 17 figures, submitted to Phys Rev A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.62.033802",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider the interaction of a two-level atom inside an optical parametric
oscillator. In the weak driving field limit, we essentially have an atom-cavity
system driven by the occasional pair of correlated photons, or weakly squeezed
light. We find that we may have holes, or dips, in the spectrum of the
fluorescent and transmitted light. This occurs even in the strong-coupling
limit when we find holes in the vacuum-Rabi doublet. Also, spectra with a
sub-natural linewidth may occur. These effects disappear for larger driving
fields, unlike the spectral narrowing obtained in resonance fluorescence in a
squeezed vacuum; here it is important that the squeezing parameter $N$ tends to
zero so that the system interacts with only one correlated pair of photons at a
time. We show that a previous explanation for spectral narrowing and spectral
holes for incoherent scattering is not applicable in the present case, and
propose a new explanation. We attribute these anomalous effects to quantum
interference in the two-photon scattering of the system.

spin-1/2 particles, and for a choice of observables, there is a unique state
which shows Hardy-type nonlocality. Moreover, an explicit expression for the
probability that an ensemble of particle pairs prepared in such a state
exhibits a Hardy-type nonlocality contradiction is given in terms of two
independent parameters related to the observables involved. Incidentally, a
wrong statement expressed in Mermin's proof of the converse [N.D. Mermin, Am.
J. Phys. 62, 880 (1994)] is pointed out.

motion. The mass is protected from perturbations by a cage, and the motion of
the latter is actively controlled to follow the motion of the proof mass. We
present a theoretical analysis of the effects of quantum fluctuations for this
technique. We show that a perfect drag free operation is in principle possible
at the quantum level, in spite of the back action exerted on the mass by the
position sensor.
