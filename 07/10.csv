Space Observatory and the NRAO Very Large Array. A search was also made for CO
line emission in two of the galaxies with the Onsala 20m radio telescope and
upper limits were placed on the mass of molecular gas in those galaxies. The
ring galaxy is believed to owe its morphology to a slightly off-center
collision between an `intruder' galaxy and a disk. An off-center collision is
predicted to generate a radially expanding density wave in the disk which
should show large azimuthal variations in overdensity, and have observational
consequences. The radio continuum emission shows the largest asymmetry,
exhibiting a crescent-shaped distribution consistent with either the trapping
of cosmic-ray particles in the target disk, or an enhanced supernova rate in
the compressed region. On the other hand, the ISO observations (especially
those made at $\lambda9.6\mu$m) show a more scattered distribution, with
emission centers associated with powerful star formation sites distributed more
uniformly around the ring. Low-signal to noise observations at
$\lambda15.0\mu$m show possible emission inside the ring, with little emission
directly associated with the \ion{H}{2} regions. The observations emphasize the
complex relationship between the generation of radio emission and the
development of star formation even in relatively simple and well understood
collisional scenarios.

uncertainties in the spectral indexes for the ionizing EUV (alpha_s = 1.8 +/-

range of Seyfert luminosities (0.001 - 100 L*) and the completeness of the

stringent upper limits on the ionizing background (Phi_ion < 10^4

lies within the range implied by other indirect measures. Starburst galaxies
with a sufficiently large Lyman continuum escape fraction, f_ esc > 0.05, may
provide a comparable background to AGN, I_0 (z=0) = 1.1 (+1.5/-0.7) x 10^{-23).
An additional component of the ionizing background of this magnitude would
violate neither upper limits from H-alpha observations nor the acceptable range

The X-ray outburst shows a very fast decay (initial e-folding time ~0.5 days,
slowing down to ~2.3 days). The X-ray spectrum in the 2-25 keV band is complex,
softening considerably during decay and with strongly variable intrinsic
absorption. A strong iron emission line is observed. No fast time variability
is detected (<0.5 % rms in the 1-4096 Hz band at the outburst peak). The
analysis of the optical/IR data suggests that the secondary is a B[e] star
surrounded by cool dust and places the system at a distance of >~ 2 kpc. At
this distance the peak 2-25 keV luminosity is ~4 x 10^37 erg/s. We compare the
properties of this peculiar system with those of the Be/NS LMC transient A
0538-66 and suggest that CI Cam is of similar nature. The presence of strong
radio emission during outburst indicates that the compact object is likely to
be a black hole or a weakly magnetized neutron star.

evidence supporting this conjecture. The X-ray fluxes detected in the

accounted for (an alternative to a thermal origin from hot intracluster gas).
Much less energetic electrons than those producing the synchrotron radio

  Ratio","18 pages, 5 figures, submitted to ApJ",,"10.1086/308317",,"astro-ph",,"  We have discovered a third quasar absorption system which is consistent with
a low deuterium to hydrogen abundance ratio, D/H = 3.4 times 10^-5. The z ~ 2.8
partial Lyman limit system towards QSO 0130-4021 provides the strongest
evidence to date against large D/H ratios because the H I absorption, which
consists of a single high column density component with unsaturated high order
Lyman series lines, is readily modeled -- a task which is more complex in other
D/H systems. We have obtained twenty-two hours of spectra from the HIRES
spectrograph on the W.M. Keck telescope, which allow a detailed description of
the Hydrogen. We see excess absorption on the blue wing of the H I Lyman alpha
line, near the expected position of Deuterium. However, we find that Deuterium
cannot explain all of the excess absorption, and hence there must be
contamination by additional absorption, probably H I. This extra H I can
account for most or all of the absorption at the D position, and hence D/H = 0
is allowed. We find an upper limit of D/H < 6.7 times 10^-5 in this system,
consistent with the value of D/H ~ 3.4 times 10^-5 deduced towards QSO
1009+2956 and QSO 1937-1009 by Burles and Tytler (1998a, 1998b). This
absorption system shows only weak metal line absorption, and we estimate [Si/H]
< -2.6 -- indicating that the D/H ratio of the system is likely primordial. All
four of the known high redshift absorption line systems simple enough to
provide useful limits on D are consistent with D/H = 3.4 +/- 0.25 times 10^-5.
Conversely, this QSO provides the third case which is inconsistent with much
larger values.

and periodic driving on phase space transport in 3-D Hamiltonian systems, a
problem directly applicable to systems like galaxies, where such perturbations
reflect internal irregularities and.or a surrounding environment. A new
diagnsotic tool is exploited to quantify how, over long times, different
segments of the same chaotic orbit can exhibit very different amounts of chaos.
First passage time experiments are used to study how small perturbations of an
individual orbit can dramatically accelerate phase space transport, allowing
`sticky' chaotic orbits trapped near regular islands to become unstuck on
suprisingly short time scales. Small perturbations are also studied in the
context of orbit ensembles with the aim of understanding how such
irregularities can increase the efficacy of chaotic mixing. For both noise and
periodic driving, the effect of the perturbation scales roughly in amplitude.
For white noise, the details are unimportant: additive and multiplicative noise
tend to have similar effects and the presence or absence of a friction related
to the noise by a Fluctuation- Dissipation Theorem is largely irrelevant.
Allowing for coloured noise can significantly decrease the efficacy of the
perturbation, but only when the autocorrelation time, which vanishes for white
noise, becomes so large that t here is little power at frequencies comparable
to the natural frequencies of the unperturbed orbit. This suggests strongly
that noise-induced extrinsic diffusion, like modulational diffusion associated
with periodic driving, is a resonance phenomenon. Potential implications for
galaxies are discussed.

skeletal LTRs, unspecified for words. New LTRs are created by instantiating a
template with words, provided that the words belong to the appropriate lexical
categories required by the template. We define two methods for creating an
inventory of templates and using them to generate new LTRs. A simpler method
consists of extracting a finite set of templates from a sample of hand coded
LTRs and directly using them in the generation process. A further method
consists of abstracting over the initial finite set of templates to define
higher level templates, where bilingual equivalences are defined in terms of
correspondences involving phrasal categories. Phrasal templates are then mapped
onto sets of lexical templates with the aid of grammars. In this way an
infinite set of lexical templates is recursively defined. New LTRs are created
by parsing input words, matching a template at the phrasal level and using the
corresponding lexical categories to instantiate the lexical template. The
definition of an infinite set of templates enables the automatic creation of
LTRs for multi-word, non-compositional word equivalences of any cardinality.

at high m(A) values where no triggering difficulties are expected with QCD

collimation or impact parameter selections are obviously possible. The main
irreducible background in these conditions is due to QCD jets with hard

high-mass reach in the m(A) tan(beta) parameter space for 3 x 10**4pb**-1 is
shown. This H -> tau+tau channel provides the highest mass reach and the best

focus on two issues related to gauge invariance. Our analysis is based on a
manifestly gauge-invariant approach that we introduced recently. It deals with
gauge-invariant Green's functions and provides a method to evaluate the
corresponding generating functional without fixing the gauge. First we show,
for the case where no fermions are included in the effective Lagrangian, that
the set of low-energy constants currently used in the literature is redundant.
In particular, by employing the equations of motion for the gauge fields one
can choose to remove two low-energy constants which contribute to the
self-energies of the gauge bosons. If fermions are included in the effective
field theory analysis the situation is more involved. Even in this case,
however, these contributions to the self-energies of the gauge bosons can be
removed. The relation of this result to the experimentally determined values
for the oblique parameters S, T, and U is discussed. In the second part of the
paper we consider the matching relation between a full and an effective theory.
We show how the low-energy constants of the effective Lagrangian can be
determined by matching gauge-invariant Green's functions in both theories. As
an application we explicitly evaluate the low-energy constants for the standard
model with a heavy Higgs boson. The matching at the one-loop level and at
next-to-leading order in the low-energy expansion is performed employing
functional methods.

Large mixing can be a property of the second and third generations, so that the
scheme with single large mixing is realized. It can be a generic property of
all leptons, thus leading to the bi-large or threefold large mixing schemes.

light front is equivalent to the usual one when bare mass is absent. A quantum
analysis demonstrates that a nonperturbative mean-field solution to the

condensate while a perturbative solution cannot. This description is due to our
identification of the ``zero-mode constraint'' with the gap equation. The
mean-field calculation clarifies unusual chiral transformation properties of
fermionic field, which resolves a seemingly inconsistency between triviality of
the null-plane chiral charge Q_5|0>=0 and nonzero condensate. We also calculate

on the two dimensional hyperboloid which admit separation of variables in at
least two coordinate systems. Here we consider two potentials introduced in a
paper of C.P.Boyer, E.G.Kalnins and P.Winternitz, which haven't yet been
studied. We give an example of an interbasis expansion and work out the
structure of the quadratic algebra generated by the integrals of motion.

nowhere interacted and whose paths nowhere crossed. The experiment puts
together two photons from two (non-maximal) singlet-like photon pairs and make
them interfere at an asymmetrical beam splitter. As a result one finds
polarization correlations between the other companion photons from the pairs
whose paths nowhere crossed each other even when no polarization measurements
have been carried out on the former photons. The latter set of photons that
nowhere interacted are therefore event-ready prepared by their pair-companion
photons. The result reveals nonlocality as a property of selection which can
even be a preselection. It also reveals that one can predict spin-correlated
behaviour of photons in space and at beam splitters by controlling a no-spin
observable. [From the Book of Abstracts as appeared at the Workshop.]

requires a detection efficiency of 67% is proposed. It enables realistic
detection efficiencies of 75% at a visibility of 85%. Two type-II crystals each
down convert one correlated photon pair and we entangle one photon from one
pair with one photon from the other pair on a highly transparent beam splitter.
The entanglement selects two other conjugate photons into a Bell state. Wide
solid angles for the conjugate photons then enable us to collect close to 100%
of them. The cases when both photon pairs come from only one of the two
crystals are successfully taken into account. Hardy's equalities are discussed.

of an unknown entangled state through noisy quantum channels. We find that the
quantum entanglement of the unknown state can be lost during the teleportation
even when the channel is quantum correlated. We introduce a fundamental
parameter of correlation information which dissipates linearly during the
teleportation through the noisy channel. Analyzing the transfer of correlation
information, we show that the purity of the initial state is important in
determining the entanglement of the replica state.

qubit is coupled independently to an environment affecting the state in a
dephasing or depolarizing way. For mixed states we suggest a quantification for
the property of showing {\it quantum} uncertainty on the macroscopic level. We
illustrate in which sense a large parameter can be seen as an indicator for
large entanglement and give hypersurfaces enclosing the set of separable
states. Using methods of the classical theory of maximum likelihood estimation
we prove that this parameter is decreasing with 1/\sqrt{n} for all those states
which have been exposed to the environment.
  Furthermore we consider a Quantum Computer with perfect 1-qubit gates and
2-qubit gates with depolarizing error and show that any state which can be
obtained from a separable initial state lies inbetween a family of pairs of
certain hypersurfaces parallel to those enclosing the separable ones.
