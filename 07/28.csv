galaxies, and in a carefully selected control sample of non-active galaxies, to
investigate the relation between the presence of bars and of nuclear activity.
To avoid the problems related to bar classification in the RC3, e.g.,
subjectivity, low resolution and contamination by dust, we have developed an
objective bar classification method, which we conservatively apply to our new
sub-arcsecond resolution near-infrared imaging data set (Peletier et al. 1999).
We are able to use stringent criteria based on radial profiles of ellipticity
and major axis position angle to determine the presence of a bar and its axial
ratio. Concentrating on non-interacting galaxies in our sample for which
morphological information can be obtained, we find that Seyfert hosts are
barred more often (79% +/- 7.5%) than the non-active galaxies in our control
sample (59% +/- 9%), a result which is at the 2.5 sigma significance level. The
fraction of non-axisymmetric hosts becomes even larger when interacting
galaxies are taken into account. We discuss the implications of this result for
the fueling of central activity by large-scale bars. This paper improves on
previous work by means of imaging at higher spatial resolution and by the use
of a set of stringent criteria for bar presence, and confirms that the use of
NIR is superior to optical imaging for detection of bars in disk galaxies.

(SNe Ia) have led to the use of SNe Ia as a ``standard candle'' to determine
cosmological parameters, such as the Hubble constant, the density parameter,
and the cosmological constant. Whether a statistically significant value of the
cosmological constant can be obtained depends on whether the peak luminosities
of SNe Ia are sufficiently free from the effects of cosmic and galactic
evolutions. Here we first review the single degenerate scenario for the
Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf (WD) models of SNe Ia. We identify the
progenitor's evolution and population with two channels: (1) the WD+RG
(red-giant) and (2) the WD+MS (near main-sequence He-rich star) channels. In
these channels, the strong wind from accreting white dwarfs plays a key role,
which yields important age and metallicity effects on the evolution. We then
address the questions whether the nature of SNe Ia depends systematically on
environmental properties such as metallicity and age of the progenitor system
and whether significant evolutionary effects exist. We suggest that the
variation of the carbon mass fraction $X$(C) in the C+O WD (or the variation of
the initial WD mass) causes the diversity of the brightness of SNe Ia. This
model can explain the observed dependence of SNe Ia brighness on the galaxy
types. Finally, applying the metallicity effect on the evolution of SN Ia
progenitors, we make a prediction of the cosmic supernova rate history as a
composite of the supernova rates in different types of galaxies.

to the He ICF. This happens because the ions cover a wide range of ionization,
the line pairs are not sensitive to electron temperature, they have similar
critical densities, and are formed within the He$^+$/H$^+$ region of the
nebula. We compute a very wide range of photoionization models appropriate for
galactic HII regions. The models cover a wide range of densities, ionization
parameters, stellar temperatures, and use continua from four very different
stellar atmospheres.
  The results show that each line pair has a critical intensity ratio above
which the He ICF is always small. Below these values the ICF depends very
strongly on details of the models for three of the ratios, and so other
information would be needed to determine the helium abundance. The [Ar III]
9$\micron$/[ArII] 6.9$\micron$ ratio can indicate the ICF directly due to the
near exact match in the critical densities of the two lines. Finally, continua
predicted by the latest generation of stellar atmospheres are sufficiently hard
that they routinely produce significantly negative ICFs.

observation a recent result of Worthey (1998) that Mg/Fe is determined by the
central kinetic energy, or escape velocity, of the stars, only, and not by the
formation time scale of the stars. A stellar population analysis using the
models of Vazdekis et al. (1996) shows that our observed H gamma agrees well
with what is predicted based on the other lines. Using the line strength of the

that Ca is an alpha-element. Finally, by combining the results of this paper

(b) for the intermediate metallicity group (-1.2<=[Fe/H]<-0.9) there is a clear

to be coeval within the uncertainties (except Pal12), but younger (~17%) than
the bulk of the Galactic globulars. The latter result is totally model
dependent. From the distribution of the GGC ages with the Galactocentric
distance, we can present a possible scenario for the Milky Way formation: The
GC formation process started at the same zero age throughout the halo, at least
out to ~20 kpc from the Galactic center. According to the present stellar
evolution models, the metal-rich globulars are formed at a later time (~ 17%
lower age). And finally, significantly younger halo GGCs are found at any

the distribution of the internal energy having two clear peaks that become more
distinct and sharp as the tricritical point is approached. However, the
distance between the peaks slowly decays to zero. The evidence shows that the

coil-globule, transition of an isolated polymer in solution can be seen in a
four-dimensional model. Here we investigate, via Monte Carlo simulations, the
canonical lattice model of polymer collapse, namely interacting self-avoiding
walks, to show that it not only has a distinct collapse transition at finite
temperature but that for any finite polymer length this collapse has many
characteristics of a rounded first-order phase transition. However, we also
show that there exists a `$\theta$-point' where the polymer behaves in a simple
Gaussian manner (which is a critical state), to which these finite-size
transition temperatures approach as the polymer length is increased. The
resolution of these seemingly incompatible conclusions involves the argument
that the first-order-like rounded transition is scaled away in the
thermodynamic limit to leave a mean-field second-order transition. Essentially
this happens because the finite-size \emph{shift} of the transition is
asymptotically much larger than the \emph{width} of the pseudo-transition and
the latent heat decays to zero (algebraically) with polymer length. This
scenario can be inferred from the application of the theory of Lifshitz,
Grosberg and Khokhlov (based upon the framework of Lifshitz) to four
dimensions: the conclusions of which were written down some time ago by
Khokhlov. In fact it is precisely above the upper critical dimension, which is
3 for this problem, that the theory of Lifshitz may be quantitatively
applicable to polymer collapse.

neutralino \chi^0_2--> \chi^0_1 ll or the 2 body decay \chi^0_2-->\tilde{l}l at
LHC. In the former case, the whole m_{ll} distribution observed at LHC would
constrain ino mixing and slepton masses. On the other hand, when \tilde{l}l
decay is open, the distribution of the asymmetry of the transverse momentum of
lepton pair A_T= p_{T1}/p_{T2} peaks at A_E=p_{1}/p_{2} in \chi^0_2 rest frame
for m_{ll} << m^{max}_{ll} samples, providing another model independent
information. The peak position and the edge of the m_{ll} distribution
constrain m_{\chi^0_2}, m_{\chi}^0_1} and m_{\tilde{l}}. Slepton mass
universality may be checked within a few % in the early stage of the
experiment. Finally I discuss the physics at TeVscale LC. The mass and
couplings of sparticles will be measured withinO(1%) error, and measurement of
the radiative correction to the ino-slepton-lepton coupling will determine the
first generation squark mass scale even in decoupling scenarios.

reflection symmetry. We observe effective irreversibility and approximate
thermalization. At large time the system approaches stationary solutions in the
vicinity of, but not identical to, thermal equilibrium. The ensemble therefore
retains some memory of the initial condition beyond the conserved total energy.
Such a behavior with incomplete thermalization is referred to as ""mesoscopic
dynamics"". It is expected for systems in a small volume. Surprisingly, we find
that the nonthermal asymptotic stationary solutions do not change for large
volume. This raises questions on Boltzmann's conjecture that macroscopic
isolated systems thermalize.

approach allows one to take into account the gauge invariance conditions (Ward
identities) and to perform the renormalization program. The iteration scheme
can be realized in two versions. The first one (""perturbative vacuum"")
corresponds to chain summation in the diagram language. In this version in
four-dimensional theory the non-physical singularity (Landau pole) arises which
leads to the triviality of the renormalized theory. The second version
(""nonperturbative vacuum"") corresponds to ladder summation and permits one to
make non-perturbative calculations of physical quantities in spite of the
triviality problem. For chiral-symmetrical leading approximation two terms of
the expansion of the first-step vertex function over photon momentum are
calculated. A formula for anomalous magnetic moment is obtained. A problem of
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) is considered, the calculations are
performed for renormalized theory in Minkowsky space. In the strong coupling
region DCSB-solutions arise. For the renormalized theory a DCSB-solution is
also possible in the weak coupling region but with a subsidiary condition on

second Betti number at least three, then it must be isomorphic to a subgroup of
S^1 x S^1, and the action must have nonempty fixed-point set.
  Our results strengthen and complement recent work by Edmonds, Hambleton and
Lee, and Wilczynski, among others. Our tools include representation theory,
finite group theory, and Borel equivariant cohomology.

  the new version",,,,"math.QA",,"  The main object considered in this paper is the trace function, defined as a
suitably normalized trace of a product of intertwining operators for the
Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group, multiplied by the exponential of an element of
the Cartan subalgebra. This function depends of two parameters -- the element
of the Cartan subalgebra, and the highest weight of the Verma module in which
the trace is taken. The main results of the paper are that the trace function
satisfies two systems of difference equations with respect to the first
parameter (the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard and Macdonald-Ruijsenaars
equations), and that it is symmetric with respect to the two parameters. In
particular, this implies that for each of the above two systems of equations
there is the dual system with respect to the second parameter, which is also
satisfied by the trace function.
  The paper establishes a connection between the I.Frenkel-Reshetikhin theory
of quantum conformal blocks, the work of Felder-Mukhin-Tarasov-Varchenko on the
quantum KZB and Ruijsenaars equations, the work of Etingof-I.Frenkel- Kirillov
Jr.-Styrkas on traces of intetwining operators, and the Macdonald- Cherednik
theory. The methods of the paper are based on the theory of dynamical twists
and R-matrices.

thermonuclear 50Ti(n,gamma)51Ti(5.8 min) cross section was measured by the fast
cyclic activation technique via the 320.852 and 928.65 keV gamma-ray lines of
the 51Ti-decay. Metallic Ti samples of natural isotopic composition and samples
of TiO2 enriched in 50Ti by 67.53 % were irradiated between two gold foils
which served as capture standards. The capture cross-section was measured at
the neutron energies 25, 30, 52, and 145 keV, respectively. The direct capture
cross section was determined to be 0.387 +/- 0.011 mbarn at 30 keV. We found
evidence for a bound state s-wave resonance with an estimated radiative width
of 0.34 eV which destructively interfers with direct capture. The strength of a
suggested s-wave resonance at 146.8 keV was determined. The present data served
to calculate, in addition to the directly measured Maxwellian averaged capture
cross sections at 25 and 52 keV, an improved stellar 50Ti(n,gamma)51Ti rate in
the thermonuclear energy region from 1 to 250 keV. The new stellar rate leads
at low temperatures to much higher values than the previously recommended rate,
e.g., at kT=8 keV the increase amounts to about 50 %. The new reaction rate
therefore reduces the abundance of 50Ti due to s-processing in AGB stars.

Starting from the axioms of (1) electric charge conservation, (2) the existence
of a Lorentz force density, and (3) magnetic flux conservation, we will derive
Maxwell's equations. They are expressed in terms of the field strengths
$(E,{\cal B})$, the excitations $({\cal D},H)$, and the sources $(\rho,j)$.
This fundamental set of four microphysical equations has to be supplemented by
somewhat less general constitutive assumptions in order to make it a fully
determined system with a well-posed initial value problem. It is only at this
stage that a distance concept (metric) is required for space-time. We will
discuss one set of possible constitutive assumptions, namely ${\cal D}\sim E$
and $H\sim {\cal B}$. {\em file erik8a.tex, 1999-07-27}
