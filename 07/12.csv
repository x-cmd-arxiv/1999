study of dense galaxian environments --- where interactions, tidally induced
activity, and mergers are expected to be at their highest rate of occurrence.
Here, we present first results from a new catalogue of compact groups, one
based upon the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). Using the equivalent width
of [OII]3727, we have studied the star formation activity in LCRS CGs: we find
strong evidence of depressed star formation in CGs relative to that in loose
groups or the field. Although much of this effect can be ascribed to
morphological mix (CGs contain a high fraction of early-type galaxies), there
is some evidence that the star formation rate in late-type galaxies is
particularly deficient --- perhaps only one-half to one-third that of field
spirals. We conclude that gas stripping mechanisms may play a role in CG
environments.

homogeneity and isotropy. Observationally one can find evidence that supports
these assumptions on very large scales, the strongest being the almost isotropy
of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation after assigning the whole dipole
to our proper motion relative to this background. However, on small and on
intermediate scales up to several hundreds of Mpcs, there are strong deviations
from homogeneity and isotropy. Here the problem arises how to relate the
observations with the homogeneous and isotropic models. The usual proposal for
solving this problem is to assume that Friedmann-Lemaitre models describe the
mean observables. Such mean values may be identified with spatial averages. For
Newtonian fluid dynamics the averaging procedure has been discussed in detail
in Buchert and Ehlers (1997), leading to an additional backreaction term in the
Friedmann equation. We use the Eulerian linear approximation and the
`Zel'dovich approximation' to estimate the effect of the backreaction term on
the expansion. Our results indicate that even for domains matching the
background density in the mean, the evolution of the scale factor strongly
deviates from the Friedmann solution, critically depending on the velocity

understanding the anomalous scaling in the anisotropic sectors. We show here
that the solutions of the Kraichnan equation for the $n$ order correlations
foliate into sectors that are classified by the irreducible representations of
the SO(d) group. We find a discrete spectrum of universal anomalous exponents
in every sector. Generically the correlations and structure functions appear as
sums over all the contributions, with non-universal amplitudes which are
determined by the anisotropic boundary conditions. The isotropic sector is
always characterized by the smallest exponent, and therefore for sufficiently
small scales local isotropy is always restored. The calculation of the
anomalous exponents is done in two complementary ways. In the first they are
obtained from the analysis of correlations of gradient fields. The
corresponding theory involves the control of logarithmic divergences which
translate into anomalous scaling with the ratio of the inner and the outer
scales appearing in the final result. In the second way we compute the
exponents from the zero modes of the Kraichnan equation for the correlations of
the scalar field itself. In this case the renormalization scale is the outer
scale. The two approaches lead to the same scaling exponents for the same
statistical objects, illuminating the relative role of the outer and inner
scales as renormalization scales. We derive fusion rules which govern the small
scale asymptotics of the correlation functions in the sectors of the symmetry
group, in all dimensions.

with the charge discreteness. The uncertainty relation for electric charge and
current is given. Because the stationary Schr\""odinger equation is turned to be

tool (jH) patterned on javah automates the creation of C++WJ classes.
  The paper presents the rationale behind the choices that led to C++WJ.
Handling of Java class and interface hierarchy including Java type downcasts is
discussed. Efficiency considerations in the C++WJ lead to two flavors of C++

a JNI object reference. A Jtype is a heavyweight full wrapper of a JNI object

to new normalizations for the boundary two-point functions. In the massless

precisely the unitarity bound for scalar operators. We find a one-parameter
family of boundary conditions in the mixed case. There are again new
normalizations for the boundary two-point functions. For a particular choice of
the mixed boundary condition and with the mass squared in the range
$-d^2/4<m^2<-d^2/4+1$ the boundary operator has conformal dimension comprised
in the interval $[\frac{d-2}{2}, \frac{d}{2}]$. For mass squared $m^2>-d^2/4+1$

further establish a one-to-one correspondence between Lorentzian triangulations
and directed Random Walks. This gives a simple explanation why the Lorentzian
triangulations have fractal dimension 2 and why the curvature model lies in the
universality class of pure Lorentzian gravity. We also study integrable
generalizations of the curvature model with arbitrary polygonal tiles. All of

essential role in the solution of Thurston's ending lamination conjecture in

inside a magnetic trap with respect to spin flips, as a first step in our

that was used in this study was physically unrealistic because the magnetic
field was not curl-free. Here, we study, both classically and
quantum-mechanically, the problem of a neutral particle with spin S, mass m and
magnetic moment mu, moving in 3D in an inhomogeneous magnetic field
corresponding to traps of the Ioffe-Pritchard, `clover-leaf' and `baseball'
type. Defining by omega_p, omega_z and omega_r the precessional, the axial and
the lateral vibrational frequencies, respectively, of the particle in the
adiabatic potential, we find classically the region in the $(\omega_{r}%
(omega_r -- omega_z) plane where the particle is trapped.
  Quantum-mechanically, we study the problem of a spin-one particle in the same
field. Treating omega_r / omega_p and omega_z / omega_p as small parameters for
the perturbation from the adiabatic Hamiltonian, we derive a closed-form
expression for the transition rate 1/T_{esc} of the particle from its trapped
ground-state. We find that in the extreme cases, the expression for 1/T_{esc}
is dominated by the largest of the two frequencies omega_r and omega_z.
