show that the majority of the Class I sources in Taurus cannot be Class II
sources viewed edge-on because they are too luminous and their colors would be
consistent with disks seen only in a narrow range of inclinations. Our models
appear to be too geometrically thick at large radii, as suggested by: (a)
larger far-infrared disk emission than in the typical SEDs of T Tauri stars;
(b) wider dark dust lanes in the model images than in the images of HH30 and HK
Tau/c; and (c) larger predicted number of stars extincted by edge-on disks than
consistent with current surveys. The large thickness of the model is a
consequence of the assumption that dust and gas are well-mixed, suggesting that
some degree of dust settling may be required to explain the observations.

demonstrated that a very simple model in which supermassive black holes form
and accrete most of their mass in mergers of galaxies of comparable masses can
reproduce the observed relation of black hole mass to bulge luminosity. Here we
show that this simple model can account for the luminosity function of quasars
and for the redshift evolution of the quasar population provided a few
additional assumptions are made. We use the extended Press-Schechter formalism
to simulate the formation of galaxies in hierarchical models of the formation
of structures and we assume that, when two galaxies of comparable masses merge,
their central black holes coalesce and a fraction of the gas in the merger
remnant is accreted by the supermassive black hole over a time-scale of about
10^7 yr. We find that the decrease in the merging rate with cosmic time and the
depletion in the amount of cold gas available due to the formation of stars are
not sufficient to explain the strong decline in the space density of bright
quasars between z=2 and z=0, since larger and larger structures form, which can
potentially host brighter and brighter quasars. To explain the redshift
evolution of the space density of bright quasars between z=2 and z=0 we need to
assume that there is a dependence on redshift either in the fraction of
available gas accreted or in the time-scale for accretion.

density LCDM model. The high force, 2kpc/h, and mass, 10^9Msun/h, resolution
allows dark matter halos to survive in very dense environments of groups and
clusters making it possible to use halos as galaxy tracers. We find that the
velocity bias pvb measured as a ratio of pairwise velocities of the halos to
that of the dark matter evolves with time and depends on scale. At high
redshifts (z ~5) halos move generally faster than the dark matter almost on all
scales: pvb(r)~1.2, r>0.5Mpc/h. At later moments the bias decreases and gets
below unity on scales less than r=5Mpc/h: pvb(r)~(0.6-0.8) at z=0. We find that
the evolution of the pairwise velocity bias follows and probably is defined by
the spatial antibias of the dark matter halos at small scales. One-point
velocity bias b_v, defined as the ratio of the rms velocities of halos and dark
matter, provides a more direct measure of the difference in velocities because
it is less sensitive to the spatial bias. We analyze b_v in clusters of
galaxies and find that halos are ``hotter'' than the dark matter: b_v=(1.2-1.3)
for r=(0.2-0.8)r_vir, where r_vir is the virial radius. At larger radii, b_v
decreases and approaches unity at r=(1-2)r_vir. We argue that dynamical
friction may be responsible for this small positive velocity bias b_v>1 found

the LMC have difficulties. One of these proposed explanations, LMC
self-lensing, which invokes ordinary LMC stars as the long sought-after lenses,
has recently gained considerable popularity as a possible solution to the
microlensing conundrum. In this paper, we carefully examine the set of LMC
self-lensing models. In particular, we review the pertinent observations made
of the LMC, and show how these observations place limits on such self-lensing
models. We find that, given current observational constraints, no purely LMC
disk models are capable of producing optical depths as large as that reported
in the MACHO collaboration 2-year analysis. Besides pure disk, we also consider
alternate geometries, and present a framework which encompasses the previous
studies of LMC self-lensing. We discuss which model parameters need to be
pushed in order for such models to succeed. For example, like previous workers,
we find that an LMC halo geometry may be able to explain the observed events.
However, since all known LMC tracer stellar populations exhibit disk-like
kinematics, such models will have difficulty being reconciled with
observations. For SMC self-lensing, we find predicted optical depths differing
from previous results, but more than sufficient to explain all observed SMC
microlensing. In contrast, for the LMC we find a self-lensing optical depth
contribution between 0.47e-8 and 7.84e-8, with 2.44e-8 being the value for the

basic models of population genetics, which describe the evolution of the
composition of a population under the joint action of the various evolutionary
forces. Building on these foundations, we specify the ingredients explicitly,
namely, the various mutation models and fitness landscapes. We then review
recent developments concerning models of mutational degradation. These predict
upper limits for the mutation rate above which mutation can no longer be
controlled by selection, the most important phenomena being error thresholds,
Muller's ratchet, and mutational meltdowns. Error thresholds are deterministic
phenomena, whereas Muller's ratchet requires the stochastic component brought
about by finite population size. Mutational meltdowns additionally rely on an
explicit model of population dynamics, and describe the extinction of
populations. Special emphasis is put on the mutual relationship between these

  latex pages including 12 embedded ps figs",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  A large number (~10,000) of uniform stainless steel balls comprising less
than one layer coverage on a vertically shaken plate provides a rich system for
the study of excited granular media. Viewed from above, the horizontal motion
in the layer shows interesting collective behavior as a result of inelastic
particle-particle collisions. Clusters appear as localized fluctuations from
purely random density distributions, as demonstrated by increased particle
correlations. The clusters grow as the medium is ""cooled"" by reducing the rate
of energy input. Further reduction of the energy input leads to the nucleation
of a collapse: a close-packed crystal of particles at rest. High speed
photography allows for measurement of particle velocities between collisions.
The velocity distributions deviate strongly from a Maxwell distribution at low
accelerations, and show approximately exponential tails, possibly due to an
observed cross-correlation between density and velocity fluctuations. When the
layer is confined with a lid, the velocity distributions at higher
accelerations are non-Maxwellian and independent of the granular temperature.

substantially in heavy-ion collisions to provide an explanation for the
observed antikaon production rates at threshold. We demonstrate that the
in-medium production cross section of antikaons via pions and Sigma hyperons is
remarkably enhanced up to an order of magnitude. The effect of in medium
correction on the resulting kaon spectra is studied within a transport model.
We find that both in medium correction lead to about the same enhancement of
the spectrum. However, once the temperature dependence is taken into account no

different transverse density profiles for the particle emission region allows
for a quantitative discussion of possible model dependencies of the results.
Our fit results suggest a low thermal freeze-out temperature T approximately 95

Moreover, the fit favours a box-shaped transverse density profile over a
Gaussian one. We discuss the origins and the consequences of these results in
detail. In order to reproduce the measured pion multiplicity our model requires
a positive pion chemical potential. A study of the pion phase-space density
indicates \mu_\pi approximately 60 MeV for T = 100 MeV.

  equivalence with matrix method","22 pages, 10 figures",,,,"physics.acc-ph",,"  Analyses of betatron coupling can be broadly divided into two categories: the
matrix approach that decouples the single-turn matrix to reveal the normal
modes and the hamiltonian approach that evaluates the coupling in terms of the
action of resonances in perturbation theory. The latter is often regarded as
being less exact but good for physical insight. The common opinion is that the
correction of the two closest sum and difference resonances to the working
point is sufficient to reduce the off-axis terms in the 4X4 single-turn matrix,
but this is only partially true. The reason for this is explained, and a method
is developed that sums to infinity all coupling resonances and, in this way,
obtains results equivalent to the matrix approach. The two approaches is
discussed with reference to the dynamic aperture. Finally, the extension of the
summation method to resonances of all orders is outlined and the relative
importance of a single resonance compared to all resonances of a given order is
analytically described as a function of the working point.

ridges running circumferentially about the torso. These ridges extend into the
turbulent boundary layer and affect the evolution of coherent structures. The
development and evolution of coherent structures over a surface is described by
the formation and dynamics of vortex filaments. The dynamics of these filaments
over a flat, non-ridged surface is determined analytically, as well as through
numerical simulation, and found to agree with the observations of coherent
structures in the turbulent boundary layer. The calculation of the linearized
dynamics of the vortex filament, successful for the dynamics of a filament over
a flat surface, is extended and applied to a vortex filament propagating over a
periodically ridged surface. The surface ridges induce a rapid parametric
forcing of the vortex filament, and alter the filament dynamics significantly.
A consideration of the contribution of vortex filament induced flow to energy
transport indicates that the behavior of the filament induced by the ridges can
directly reduce surface drag by up to 8%. The size, shape, and distribution of
cutaneous ridges for Tursiops Truncatus is found to be optimally configured to
affect the filament dynamics and reduce surface drag for swimming velocities
consistent with observation.
