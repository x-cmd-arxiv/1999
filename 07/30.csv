luminosity-weighted ages of the E and S0 galaxies in these clusters. The
precision of this measurement would indicate that any recent star formation in
the cluster S0s at z=0.31 could have involved bursts of no more than ~11% (by
mass) in strength in no more than half of these galaxies. Our results, in
conjunction with other work, suggest that the progenitors of S0 galaxies in

simple families of analytic, thermohydrodynamic models for these global states,

formation rates, phase balances, and hydrodynamic forces are all tightly
coupled and balanced. The models have stratified radial flows, with the cold
gas slowly flowing inward in the midplane of the disk, and with the warm/hot

  The models suggest a number of results that are in accord with observation,
as well as some novel predictions, including the following. 1) The large-scale
gas density and thermal phase distributions in galaxy disks can be explained as
the result of turbulent heating and spatial couplings. 2) The turbulent
pressures and stresses that drive radial outflows in the warm gas also allow a
reduced circular velocity there. This effect was observed by Swaters, Sancisi

(LF) is a power law, with exponent \alpha = -2.12 +/- 0.04. However, after
decoupling the cluster and stellar LFs, which overlap in the range -9 < M_V <

slightly lower than the characteristic mass of globular clusters in the Milky

resolved, with median effective radii of 4 +/- 1 pc, similar to or perhaps
slightly larger than those of globular clusters in our Galaxy. However, the
radial extents of some of the very young clusters (ages < 10 Myr) are much
larger than those of old globular clusters. A combination of the UBVI colors,
\Halpha morphology, and GHRS spectra enables us to age-date the clusters in
different regions of The Antennae. We find two groups of young star clusters
with ages <~ 20Myr and ~100Myr, as well as an intermediate-age group (~500 Myr)
and a handful of old globular clusters from the progenitor galaxies. Age
estimates derived from GHRS spectroscopy yield 3 +/- 1 Myr for Knot K (just

in the rotating core stabilizes against convection. The limited convection
leads to explosions which occur later and are weaker than the explosions
produced from the collapse of non-rotating cores. However, because the
convection is constrained to the polar regions, when the explosion occurs, it
is stronger along the polar axis. This asymmetric explosion can explain the
polarization measurements of core-collapse supernovae. These asymmetries also
provide a natural mechanism to mix the products of nucleosynthesis out into the
helium and hydrogen layers of the star. We also discuss the role the collapse
of these rotating stars play on the generation of magnetic fields and neutron
star kicks. Given a range of progenitor rotation periods, we predict a range of
supernova energies for the same progenitor mass. The critical mass for black

gas pressure-driven jet. On the other hand, in the counter-rotating disk case,
a new powerful magnetically-driven jet is formed inside the gas pressure-driven

unseen in deep optical surveys due to dust obscuration. Current models suggest
that this population represents the formation of the spheroidal components of
galaxies at z between 2 and 5, constituting about half of the total amount of
cosmic star formation from the big bang to the present. High resolution imaging
at cm wavelengths provides sub-arcsecond astrometry, and can be used to search
for gravitational lensing and/or for the presence of an AGN. Radio continuum
observations provide unique information on the magnetic fields in early
galaxies, and give a gross indication of the star formation rate, while the

quite broad and the fraction of blue galaxies (\sim 70%) is much larger than in
intermediate-redshift clusters. Using evolutionary synthesis models, we show
that this color distribution can be explained by galaxies with various amounts
of star-formation activity mixed with the old stellar populations. Notably,
there are about a dozen galaxies which show very red optical-NIR colors but
also show significant UV excess with respect to passive-evolution models. They
can be interpreted as old early-type galaxies with a small amount of star
formation. The fact that the UV-excess red galaxies are more abundant than the
quiescent red ones suggests that a large fraction of old galaxies in this
cluster are still forming stars to some extent. However, a sequence of
quiescent red galaxies is clearly identified on the R-K versus K

observational contamination in general relativistic cosmology. In particular,
we consider the nonlinear effects of density and velocity evolution using
high-resolution N-body simulations in cold dark matter models. We find that the
theoretical modeling on the basis of the fitting formulae of nonlinear density
and velocity fields accurately describes the numerical results, especially in
quasi-nonlinear regimes. These corrections for nonlinear effects are essential
in order to use the the cosmological redshift-space distortion as a
cosmological test. We perform a feasibility test to derive constraints from the
future catalogues of high-redshift quasars using our theoretical modeling and
results of N-body simulations. Applying the present methodology to the future
data from on-going surveys of high-redshift galaxies and quasars will provide a
useful tool to constrain a geometry of the universe.

diagram is often used to determine their mass and age by comparison with
pre-main-sequence evolution tracks. On the assumption that the stellar models
are accurate, we demonstrate that, if the metallicity is known, the mass
obtained is a good estimate. However, the age determination can be very
misleading because it is significantly (generally different by a factor of two
to five) dependent on the accretion rate and, for ages less than about one
million years, the initial state of the star. We present a number of accreting
protostellar tracks that can be used to determine age if the initial conditions
can be determined and the underlying accretion rate has been constant in the
past. Because of the balance established between the Kelvin-Helmholtz,
contraction timescale and the accretion timescale a pre-main-sequence star
remembers its accretion history. Knowledge of the current accretion rate,
together with an H--R-diagram position gives information about the rate of
accretion in the past but does not necessarily improve any age estimate. We do
not claim that ages obtained by comparison with these particular accreting
tracks are likely to be any more reliable than those from comparisons with
non-accreting tracks. Instead we stress the unreliability of any such
comparisons and use the disparities between various tracks to estimate the
likely errors in age and mass estimates. We also show how a set of coeval
accreting objects do not appear coeval when compared with non-accreting tracks.
Instead accreting pre-main-sequence stars of around a solar mass are likely to
appear older than those of either smaller or larger mass.

could affect the interpretation of the recent high-redhisft Type Ia supernovae
results. If the local value of $G$ at the space-time location of distant
supernovae is different, it would change both the thermonuclear energy release
and the time scale of the supernova outburst. In both cases the effect is
related to a change in the Chandrasekhar mass $M_{\rm Ch}\propto G^{-3/2}$.
Moreover the integrated variation of $G$ with time would also affect cosmic
evolution and therefore the luminosity distance relation. Here we investigate
in a consistent way how these different effects of a varying $G$ could change
the current interpretation of the Hubble diagram of Type Ia supernovae. We
parametrize the variation of $G$ using scalar-tensor theories of gravity, such
as the Jordan-Brans-Dicke theory or its extensions. It is remarkable that
Dirac's hypothesis that $G$ should decrease with time can qualitatively explain
the observed $\Delta m \simeq 0.2$ mag decrease at $z\simeq 0.5$ (with respect
to a decelerating universe) and, at the same time, reduce the duration of the
risetimes of distant Type Ia supernovae as recently reported.

0.2; these results might suggest that the dynamics of the observed objects are
similar. We then proceed to investigate the existence of anisotropy in the
scaling of GGD 18 using the Generalized Scale Invariance (GSI) formalism. It is
found that differential rotation and stratification are involved in the outflow
mechanism. The stratification is believed to be dynamical in nature i.e.,

optical potential rigorously accounts for the complex many-body nature of the

fixed-nuclei optical potential is a valid adiabatic approximation to the
dynamical optical potential even when projectile and nuclear motion are
(nonadiabatically) coupled as long as the scattering energy is well below the
electronic excitation thresholds of the target. For extremely low projectile
velocities, however, when the cross sections are most sensitive to the
scattering potential, we expect the influences of the nuclear dynamics on the
optical potential to become relevant. For these cases, a systematic way to
improve the adiabatic approximation to the dynamical optical potential is
presented that yields non-local operators with respect to the nuclear

Depending on the dimension of the one-particle Hilbert space such a universal

effect. We put the emphasis on explicit theoretical evaluations which can help
comparing experimental results with theory. The reduction of the Casimir force
is evaluated for plane metallic plates. The reduction of the Casimir energy in
the same configuration is also calculated. It can be used to infer the
reduction of the force in the plane-sphere geometry through the `proximity
theorem'. Frequency dependent dielectric response functions of the metals are
represented either by the simple plasma model or, more accurately, by using the
optical data known for the metals used in recent experiments, that is Al, Au
and Cu. In the two latter cases, the results obtained here differ significantly
from those published recently.

half-cycle pulse (HCP) is described with the help of a multidimensional
semiclassical treatment. This approach relates the quantum evolution of the
electron to its underlying classical dynamics. The method is nonperturbative
and is valid for arbitrary spatial and temporal shapes of the applied HCP. On
the basis of this approach angle- and energy-resolved spectra resulting from
the ionization of Rydberg atoms by HCPs are analyzed. The different types of
spectra obtainable in the sudden-impact approximation are characterized in
terms of the appearing semiclassical scattering phenomena. Typical
modifications of the spectra originating from finite pulse effects are
discussed.
