markets. The present model can describe the dynamics of any market where the
pricing is based on supply and demand. It will be applied here, as an example,
for the German stock market presented by the Deutscher Aktienindex (DAX), which
is a measure for the market status. The duality of the present model consists
of the superposition of the two components - the long and the short term
behaviour of the market. The long term behaviour is characterised by a stable
development which is following a trend for time periods of years or even
decades. This long term growth (or decline) is based on the development of
fundamental market figures. The short term behaviour is described as a
dynamical evaluation (trading) of the market by the participants. The trading
process is described as an exchange between supply and demand. In the framework
of this model there the trading is modelled by a system of nonlinear
differential equations. The model also allows to explain the chaotic behaviour
of the market as well as periods of growth or crashes.

realistic template SEDs, extending over four decades in wavelength (i.e from
0.05 $\mu m$ to 1 mm). The SEDs are constructed for four different spectral
types of galaxies (elliptical, spiral, irregular and starburst) and satisfy the
following characteristics: a). they are optimised to produce the observed
colours of galaxies at $z\sim 0$; b). incorporate the chemo-photometric
spectral evolution of galaxies of different types, in agreement with
observations; c). allow treatment of dust contribution and its evolution with
redshift, consistent with the spectral evolution model; d). include absorption
and re-emission of radiation by dust and hence, realistic estimates of the
far-infrared radiation; e). include correction for inter-galactic absorption by
Lyman continuum and Lyman forest.
  Using these template SEDs, the photometric redshifts are estimated to an
accuracy of $\Delta z = 0.11$. The degeneracy in the method and hence, the
redshifts and spectral types, are explored via Monte Carlo simulations. The
consistency of the technique is demonstrated by applying it on a UV selected
sample of HDF galaxies and comparing the statistical results with those from
other independent studies.

one finds a nearly divergent contribution to the low multipole CMB anisotropy,

weaker, but matching the low multipoles forces the added feature to be large

the power spectrum of density fluctuations at small scales; (2) because of the
effects of gas clumping, full reionization occurs at z ~ 10 in all models; (3)
the CMBR polarization and the stars and quasars to baryons ratio are strong
potential discrimants between different assumed power spectra; (4) the
formation of galactic spheroids may be regulated by the evolution of reheating
through feedback, so that the Jeams mass tracks the non-linear mass scale; and

the currently-favoured low-density model with a cosmological constant, a

corresponding to different redshifts in order to include contributions to the
Compton y-parameter out to the highest necessary redshifts. Our main results
are:
  1. The mean y-distortion is around $4 \times 10^{-6}$ for low-density
cosmologies, and $1 \times 10^{-6}$ for critical density. These are below
current limits, but not by a wide margin in the former case.
  2. In low-density cosmologies, the mean y-distortion comes from a broad range
of redshifts, the bulk coming from $z < 2$ and a tail out to $z \sim 5$. For
critical-density models, most of the contribution comes from $z < 1$.
  3. The number of SZ sources above a given $y$ depends strongly on instrument
resolution. For a one arcminute beam, there is around 0.1 sources per square
degree with $y > 10^{-5}$ in a critical-density Universe, and around 8 such
sources per square degree in low-density models. Low-density models with and
without a cosmological constant give very similar results.

25000 SZ sources if the Universe has a low density, or around 10000 if it has

determination. The effect of underlying stellar absorption, though present, is
much smaller in the SE component. Assuming all systematic uncertainties are
negligible, the He mass fraction derived in this component is Y =
0.243+/-0.007. The high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum (> 100 in the continuum)
of SBS 0335-052 allows us to measure the helium mass fraction with a precision
better than 2% -- 5% in nine different regions along the slit. Assuming all

characterizes their size distribution. Scaling formulas are derived and used to
relate these two geometrical exponents to the roughness exponent of a
self-affine surface, thus providing independent measurements of this important
quantity. Furthermore, we define the scale dependent curvature and demonstrate
that by measuring its third moment departures of the height fluctuations from
Gaussian behavior can be ascertained. These nonlinear measures are used to
characterize the morphology of computer generated Gaussian rough surfaces,
surfaces obtained in numerical simulations of a simple growth model, and
surfaces observed by scanning-tunneling-microscopes. For experimentally
realized surfaces the self-affine scaling is cut off by a correlation length,

reflection/transmissions by partially transparent interfaces, (e.g., in
multi-layer mesoscopic structures or grain boundaries in high-Tc's), in the

argued that in the presence of interfaces, a straight-line trajectory
transforms to a simple connected 1-dimensional tree (graph) with knots, i.e.
the points where the interface scattering events occur and pieces of the
trajectories are coupled. For the 2-component trajectory ""wave function"" which
factorizes the matrix Gor'kov Green's function, a linear boundary condition on
the knot is formulated for an arbitrary interface, specular or diffusive (in
the many channel model). From the new boundary condition, we derive: (i) the
excitation scattering amplitude for the multi-channel Andreev/ordinary
reflection/transmission processes; (ii) the boundary conditions for the Riccati
equation; (iii) the transfer matrix which couples the trajectory Green's
function before and after the interface scattering. To show the usage of the
method, the cases of a film separated from a bulk superconductor by a partially
transparent interface, and a SIS' sandwich with finite thickness layers, are
considered. The electric current response to the vector potential (the
superfluid density $\rho_s$) with the $\pi $ phase difference in S and S' is
calculated for the sandwich. It is shown that the model is very sensitive to
imperfection of the SS' interface: the low temperature response being
paramagnetic ($\rho_s <0$) in the ideal system case, changes its sign and
becomes diamagnetic ($\rho_s > 0$) when the probability of reflection is as low
as a few percent.

intensities as a function of the laser wavelength above and below the phase
transition temperature. In the polarized Raman spectra at room temperature we
observe resonant enhancement of the 969 $cm^{-1}$ phonon mode when the laser
energy approaches 2.7 eV, presumably related to the (p-d) electron hopping
band, $O_3$($p_y$)-V($d_{xy}$), at 3.2 eV. The 969 $cm^{-1}$ mode originates
from the stretching vibrations along the c-axis involving the V-$O_1$ bonds.
Since an ellipsometric determination of the dielectric function $\epsilon_{cc}$
yields no structure in the 1.7 to 5.5 eV photon energy range, we conclude that
plane bonds couple strongly with the apical oxygens leading to a large Raman
efficiency. In the low-temperature Raman spectra, almost all modes that become
active below the phase transition temperature T$_c$=34 K show resonant
behavior. The most interesting ones, those at 66 and 106 $cm^{-1}$, possibly of
magnetic origin, exhibit a resonant intensity enhancement, approximately by an
order of magnitude, for laser photon energies around 1.85 eV with respect to
2.43 eV. This resonance effect may be associated with a weak absorption band
around 2 eV. Finally, a destructive interference between the resonant and the
nonresonant contribution to the Raman scattering amplitude (i.e. an
antiresonance) is found in the spectra for most of the (bb) low-temperature
modes.

potential. We then proceed to examine results for a quantum point contact (QPC)
in a normal lead connecting to a superconductor. Of interest is the fluctuating
current in a gate capacitively coupled to a QPC. The results are compared with
the case when all leads are normal. We find a doubling of the equilibrium
charge fluctuations and a large enhancement (>2) in the current noise spectrum
to first order in |eV|, when a channel in the QPC is opening.

regularized massless on-shell double box Feynman diagrams with arbitrary
polynomials in numerators and general integer powers of propagators. Recurrence
relations following from integration by parts are solved explicitly and any
given double box diagram is expressed as a linear combination of two master
double boxes and a family of simpler diagrams. The first master double box
corresponds to all powers of the propagators equal to one and no numerators,
and the second master double box differs from the first one by the second power
of the middle propagator. By use of differential relations, the second master
double box is expressed through the first one up to a similar linear
combination of simpler double boxes so that the analytical evaluation of the
first master double box provides explicit analytical results, in terms of
polylogarithms $\Li{a}{-t/s}$, up to $a=4$, and generalized polylogarithms
$S_{a,b}(-t/s)$, with $a=1,2$ and $b=2$, dependent on the Mandelstam variables
$s$ and $t$, for an arbitrary diagram under consideration.

dGamma/dE_gamma including the infinite set of terms of the form alpha_s^n
log^{n+1}(1-x) and alpha_s^n log^n(1-x) in the Sudakov exponent. The
resummation is potentially important since these logs turn into
log(2E_{cut}/m_b), when the rate is integrated from the lower cut
x=2E_{cut}/m_b to 1. The resummed rate is then convolved with models for the
structure function to study whether or not the logs will be enhanced due to the
fermi motion of the heavy quark. A detailed discussion of the accuracy of the
calculation with and without the inclusion of the non-perturbative effects
dictated by the B meson structure function is given. We also investigate the
first moment with respect to (1-x), which can be used to measure \bar\Lambda
and lambda_1. It is shown that there are some two loop corrections which are
just as large as the alpha_s^2 beta_0 term, which are usually expected to
dominate. We conclude that, for the present energy cut, the threshold logs do
not form a dominant sub-series and therefore their resummation is unnecessary.
Thus, the prospects for predicting the rate for B -> X_s gamma accurately,
given the present energy cut, are promising.

gauge invariance, supersymmetry and translational invariance, simple symmetry

exact relations between physical quantities that are valid to all orders, and
they provide a powerful tool for the practical determination of the

regularization, where supersymmetry is spoiled at the regularized level, and
show how the counterterms necessary to restore supersymmetry can be read off

however, subtleties in this translation related to generic growth of amplitudes
near the boundary of anti de-Sitter space. Flat space amplitudes are recovered
after a delicate projection of CFT correlators onto normal-mode frequencies of

and construction of finite-dimensional (minimal) triangular Hopf algebras (A,R)
introduced by Drinfeld. Only recently Etingof and the author completely solved
this problem for semisimple A over algebraically closed fields of
characteristics 0 and p>>dim(A) (any p if one assumes that A is also
cosemisimple). In this paper we take the first step towards solving this
problem for finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras over an algebraically
closed field k of characteristic 0. We first prove that the fourth power of the
antipode of any triangular pointed Hopf algebra A is the identity. We do that
by focusing on minimal triangular pointed Hopf algebras (A,R) (every triangular
Hopf algebra contains a minimal triangular sub Hopf algebra) and proving that
the group algebra of the group of grouplike elements of A (which must be
abelian) admits a minimal triangular structure and consequently that A has the
structure of a biproduct. We also generalize our result on the order of the
antipode to any finite-dimensional quasitriangular Hopf algebra A whose
Drinfeld element u acts as a scalar in any irreducible representation of A
(e.g. when A^* is pointed). Second, we describe a method of construction of
finite-dimensional pointed Hopf algebras which admit a minimal triangular
structure, and classify all their minimal triangular structures. We conclude
the paper by proving that any minimal triangular Hopf algebra which is
generated as an algebra by grouplike elements and skew primitive elements is
isomorphic to a minimal triangular Hopf algebra constructed using our method.

particle emission takes place from the whole space-time domain available for

in fluid dynamical models. Pions are continuously emitted from the whole volume
of the reaction and reflect the main trends of the system evolution. Nucleons
in Pb+Pb collisions initially come from the surface region. For both systems
there is a separation of the elastic and inelastic freeze-out. The mesons with
large transverse momenta, $p_t$, are predominantly produced at the early stages
of the reaction. The low $p_t$-component is populated by mesons coming mainly
from the decay of resonances. This explains naturally the decreasing source
sizes with increasing $p_t$, observed in HBT interferometry. Comparison with
S+S and Au+Au systems at 11.6 AGeV/$c$ is also presented.

\geq 10$ fm/$c$ in a central cell. At these times the equation of state may be
approximated by a simple dependence $P \cong (0.12-0.15) \epsilon$. Increasing
deviations of the yields and the energy spectra of hadrons from statistical
model values are observed for increasing bombarding energies. The origin of
these deviations is traced to the irreversible multiparticle decays of strings
and many-body $(N \geq 3)$ decays of resonances. The violations of LE indicate
that the matter in the cell reaches a steady state instead of idealized
equilibrium. The entropy density in the cell is only about 6% smaller than that
of the equilibrium state.
