NGC 4258 by Wilkes et al. (1995) provides an intriguing application of the
unified model of Seyfert nuclei to a galaxy in which there is known to be an
edge-on, rotating disk of molecular gas surrounding the nucleus. Unlike most
Seyfert nuclei, however, NGC 4258 has strongly polarized narrow emission lines.
To further investigate the origin of the polarized emission, we have obtained
spectropolarimetric observations of the NGC 4258 nucleus at the Keck-II
telescope. The narrow-line polarizations range from 1.0% for [S II] 6716 to
13.9% for the [O II] 7319,7331 blend, and the position angle of polarization is
oriented nearly parallel to the projected plane of the masing disk. A
correlation between critical density and degree of polarization is detected for
the forbidden lines, indicating that the polarized emission arises from
relatively dense (n_e > 10^4 cm^-3) gas. An archival Hubble Space Telescope
narrow-band [O III] image shows that the narrow-line region has a compact,
nearly unresolved core, implying a FWHM size of <2.5 pc. We discuss the
possibility that the polarized emission might arise from the accretion disk
itself and become polarized by scattering within the disk atmosphere. A more
likely scenario is an obscuring torus or strongly warped disk surrounding the
inner portion of a narrow-line region which is strongly stratified in density.
The compact size of the narrow-line region implies that the obscuring structure
must be smaller than ~2.5 pc in diameter.

calculating the mean first-passage time (MFPT) for particle displacement
because of its tractability and its accessibility in real and simulation
measurements. The MFPT dynamic entropy $S(\epsilon)$ is defined to equal the
inverse of the average first-passage time for a particle to exit a sphere of
radius $\epsilon$. This measure of the degree of chaotic motion allows us to
identify characteristic time and space scales and to quantify the increasingly
correlated particle motion and intermittency occurring in supercooled liquids.
In particular, we identify a ``cage'' size defining the scale at which the
particles are transiently localized, and we observe persistent particle motion
at intermediate length scales beyond the scale where caging occurs.
Furthermore, we find that the dynamic entropy at the scale of one interparticle

generalization of the classical theories of atomic diffusion and
diffusion-induced phase separation to account for constitutive nonlinearities,
external forces, and the deformation of the lattice. In this framework, we
regard atomic diffusion as a microscopic process described by two independent
kinematic variables: (i) the atomic flux, which reckons the local motion of
atoms relative to the motion of the underlying lattice, and (ii) the time-rate
of the atomic density, which encompasses nonlocal interactions between
migrating atoms and characterizes the kinematics of phase separation. We
introduce generalized forces power-conjugate to each of these rates and require
that these forces satisfy ancillary microbalances distinct from the
conventional balance involving the forces that expend power over the rate at
which the lattice deforms. A mechanical version of the second law, which takes
the form of an energy imbalance accounting for all power expenditures
(including those due to the atomic diffusion and phase separation), is used to
derive restrictions on the constitutive equations. With these restrictions, the
microbalance involving the forces conjugate to the atomic flux provides a
generalization of the usual constitutive relation between the atomic flux and
the gradient of the diffusion potential, a relation that in conjunction with
the atomic balance yields a generalized Cahn-Hilliard equation.

formulation is purely spatial and needs no recourse to a fixed reference
configuration or an elastic-plastic decomposition of the strain. Such a
decomposition can be introduced however through an incremental elastic
deformation superposed onto an already dislocated state, but leads to
additional equilibrium conditions. The presentation emphasizes the role of
{configurational forces} as they provide a natural framework for the
description and interpretation of singularities and phase transitions.

the finite-size effects of the magnetization $M$ for the three-dimensional
Ising model in a finite cubic geometry with periodic boundary conditions. The
field theory with infinite cutoff gives a scaling form of the equation of state
$h/M^\delta = f(hL^{\beta\delta/\nu}, t/h^{1/\beta\delta})$ where
$t=(T-T_c)/T_c$ is the reduced temperature, $h$ is the external field and $L$
is the size of system. Below $T_c$ and at $T_c$ the theory predicts a
nonmonotonic dependence of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x \equiv
hL^{\beta\delta/\nu}$ at fixed $y \equiv t/h^{1/\beta \delta}$ and a crossover
from nonmonotonic to monotonic behaviour when $y$ is further increased. These
results are confirmed by MC simulation. The scaling function $f(x,y)$ obtained
from the field theory is in good quantitative agreement with the finite-size MC
data. Good agreement is also found for the bulk value $f(\infty,0)$ at $T_c$.

Feynman diagrams, and some of its applications. These are diagrams containing
one or more energetic particles that suffer very little recoil in their
interactions. When recoil is completely neglected, a decomposition formula can
be proven. This formula is a generalization of the well-known eikonal formula,
to non-abelian interactions. It expresses the amplitude as a sum of products of
irreducible amplitudes, with each irreducible amplitude being the amplitude to
emit one, or several mutually interacting, quasi-particles. For abelian
interaction a quasi-particle is nothing but the original boson, so this
decomposition formula reduces to the eikonal formula. In non-abelian situations
each quasi-particle can be made up of many bosons, though always with a total
quantum number identical to that of a single boson. This decomposition enables
certain amplitudes of all orders to be summed up into an exponential form, and
it allows subleading contributions of a certain kind, which is difficult to
reach in the usual way, to be computed. For bosonic emissions from a heavy
source with many constituents, a quasi-particle amplitude turns out to be an
amplitude in which all bosons are emitted from the same constituent. For
high-energy parton-parton scattering in the near-forward direction, the
quasi-particle turns out to be the Reggeon, and this formalism shows clearly
why gluons reggeize but photons do not. The ablility to compute subleading
terms in this formalism allows the BFKL-Pomeron amplitude to be extrapolated to
asymptotic energies, in a unitary way preserving the Froissart bound. We also
consider recoil corrections for abelian interactions in order to accommodate
the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal effect.

algebraic quantum field theory ideas from renormalization group analysis of
short-distance (high energy) behavior by passing to certain scaling limit
theories. Buchholz and Verch distinguish between different types of theories
where the limit is unique, degenerate, or classical, and the method allows in
principle to extract the `ultraparticle' content of a given model, i.e. to
identify particles (like quarks and gluons) that are not visible at finite
distances due to `confinement'. It is therefore of great importance for the
physical interpretation of the theory. The method has been illustrated in a
simple model in with some rather surprising results.
  This paper will focus on the question how the short distance behavior of
models defined by euclidean means is reflected in the corresponding behavior of
their Minkowski counterparts. More specifically, we shall prove that if a
euclidean theory has some short distance limit, then it is possible to pass
from this limit theory to a theory on Minkowski space, which is a short
distance limit of the Minkowski space theory corresponding to the original
euclidean theory.

chains Ge, Se, Kr, and Sr. We use a deformed selfconsistent HF+RPA approach
with density-dependent effective interactions of Skyrme type. We find that most
of the isotopes present two HF minima corresponding to two different shapes. In
addition to static quadrupole moments and other ground state band properties,
we present results for Gamow-Teller strength distributions, as well as for
half-lives and summed strengths. The role of deformation is particularly
emphasized.

climate to variations in insolation caused by oscillations of the orbital
parameters. However, this theory has problems to account for some major
observed phenomena of the past few million years. Here, we present an
alternative explanation for these phenomena. It is based on the idea that the
solar system until quite recently contained an additional massive object of
planetary size. This object, called Z, is assumed to have moved on a highly
eccentric orbit bound to the sun. It influenced Earth's climate through a gas
cloud of evaporated material. Calculations show that more than once during the
last 3.2 Myr it even approached the Earth close enough to provoke a significant
shift of the geographic position of the poles. The last of these shifts
terminated Earth's Ice Age epoch about 11.5 kyr ago. The origin and fate of Z
is also discussed.

from process information. The integration of product and process models in a
unified data model could provide the means by which information could be shared
across an enterprise throughout the system lifecycle from design through to
production. Recently attempts have been made to integrate these two separate
views of systems through identifying common data models. This paper relates
description-driven systems to multi-layer architectures and reveals where
existing design patterns facilitate the integration of product and process
models and where patterns are missing or where existing patterns require
enrichment for this integration. It reports on the construction of a so-called
description-driven system which integrates Product Data Management (PDM) and
Workflow Management (WfM) data models through a common meta-model.

nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computing (NMRQC). The dipolar coupling
between nuclear spins manifest in the NMR spectra of molecules oriented by a
liquid crystal permits a significant increase in clock frequency, while short
spin-lattice relaxation times permit fast recycling of algorithms, and save
time in calibration and signal-enhancement experiments. Furthermore, the use of
liquid crystal solvents offers scalability in the form of an expanded library
of spin-bearing molecules suitable for NMRQC. These ideas are demonstrated with
the successful execution of a 2-qubit Grover search using a molecule
($^{13}$C$^{1}$HCl$_3$) oriented in a liquid crystal and a clock speed eight
times greater than in an isotropic solvent. Perhaps more importantly, five
times as many logic operations can be executed within the coherence time using
the liquid crystal solvent.

mechanical state of an electron emitting synchrotron radiation and on the
intensity of that radiation. Calculations are done with the variant of
perturbation theory based on the use of extended coherent states. A general
formula is derived for the number of emitted photons, which allows for taking
into account their mutual interaction. A model problem is used to demonstrate
the absence of the infrared catastrophe in the modified perturbation theory.
Finally, the electron density matrix is calculated, and the analysis of this
matrix makes it possible to conclude that the degree of the elecron's spatial
localization increases with the passage of time if the electron is being
accelerated.

the optimal time for the detection window of photon pairs in two-photon

measurement? We propose a model independent answer: the information obtained is
equal to the minimum entropy of the outputs of the measurement, where the
minimum is taken over all measurements which measure the same ``property'' of
the state. This minimization is necessary because the measurement outcomes can
be redundant, and this redundancy must be eliminated. We show that this minimum
entropy is less or equal than the von Neumann entropy of the unknown states.
That is a measurement can extract at most one meaningful bit from every qubit
carried by the unknown states.
