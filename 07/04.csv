  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/308044",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the pulsational properties of white dwarf star models with
temperatures appropriate for the ZZ Ceti instability strip and with masses
large enough that they should be substantially crystallized. Our work is
motivated by the existence of a potentially crystallized DAV, BPM 37093, and
the expectation that digital surveys in progress will yield many more such
massive pulsators.
  A crystallized core makes possible a new class of oscillations, the torsional
modes, although we expect these modes to couple at most weakly to any motions
in the fluid and therefore to remain unobservable. The p-modes should be
affected at the level of a few percent in period, but are unlikely to be
present with observable amplitudes in crystallizing white dwarfs any more than
they are in the other ZZ Ceti's. Most relevant to the observed light variations
in white dwarfs are the g-modes. We find that the kinetic energy of these modes
is effectively excluded from the crystallized cores of our models. As
increasing crystallization pushes these modes farther out from the center, the
mean period spacing between radial overtones increases substantially with the
crystallized mass fraction. In addition, the degree and structure of mode
trapping is affected. The fact that some periods are strongly affected by
changes in the crystallized mass fraction while others are not suggests that we
may be able to disentangle the effects of crystallization from those due to
different surface layer masses.

their interrelationships are of utmost importance in the theories of structure
formation. The observational implementation of these concepts is usually based
on the Newtonian hydrodynamic equations, but used up to scales where general
relativistic effects come in. Using a perturbation of FRW metric in harmonic
gauge, we show that the relativistic effects reduce to light cone effects
including the expansion of the universe. Within the Newtonian gravitation, the
linear perturbation theory of large scale structure formation predicts the
peculiar velocity field to be directly proportional to gravitational force due
to the matter distribution. The corresponding relation between peculiar
velocity field and density contrast has been given by Peebles. Using the
general relativistic perturbation we have developed, this familiar relation is
modified by doing the calculation on the light cone in contrast to the usual
procedure of taking a space-like slice defined at a definite time. The velocity
and density--spectrum are compared to the familiar Newtonian expressions. In
particular, the relativistic $\beta$--value obtained is reduced and leads to an
increased bias factor or a decreased expected amount of the dark matter in a
cluster.

resolution of FWHM = 7 km/s, and a typical signal-to-noise ratio per 2 km/s
pixel of ~25 in the Ly-alpha forest region, and ~60 longward of the Ly-alpha
emission. The observed Ly-alpha forest systems have a mean redshift of z=2.7.
There is marginal evidence of clustering along the line of sight over the
velocity range 100 < v < 250 km/s. The 1-point and 2-point joint probability
distributions of the transmitted flux for the Ly-alpha forest were calculated,
and shown to be very insensitive to the heavy element contamination. We could
find no evidence of Voigt profile departures due to infalling gas, as observed
in the simulated forest spectra. Twelve heavy-element absorption systems were
identified, including damped Lyman-alpha systems at z=2.62 and 2.91. The C, N,
O, Al, Si, P, S, Mg, Fe, and Ni absorption features of these systems were
studied, and the elemental abundances calculated for the weak unsaturated
lines. The systems have metallicities of Z(2.62) ~1/20 Z(solar) and Z(2.91)
\~1/45 Z(solar). Both systems appear to have a low dust content. They show an
over-abundance of alpha-elements relative to Fe-peak elements, and an
under-abundance of odd atomic number elements relative to even. Nitrogen was
observed, and found to be under-abundant relative to oxygen, in line with the
time delay model of primary nitrogen production. C II* was also seen, allowing
us to determine an upper limit to the cosmic microwave background temperature
at z=2.62 of T(CMB)<12.9K.

It is found that a zero-field electrical conduction is a power function of the

Current-voltage characteristics of such nanowires are found to be nonlinear and
at sufficiently low temperatures follows the power law $I\propto V^\beta$. It

this conclusion as they indicate a $\sim 30-40%$ probability of the gluon
induced diffraction for $Q^2\sim 4 $GeV$^2$. The need for the high-precision
measurements of the $t$-dependence of inclusive and exclusive diffraction for
pinpointing higher twist effects in the gluon sector is emphasized.The $eA$
collisions at HERA would provide a strong amplification of the gluon densities
allowing to reach deep into the regime of nonlinear QCD evolution. Connection
between the leading twist nuclear shadowing and leading twist diffraction in
$ep$ scattering is explained. The presented model independent results for the
nuclear shadowing for light nuclei indicate much larger shadowing for the gluon
sector than for the sea quark sector.It is argued that HERA in $eA$ mode would
be able to discover a number of new phenomena including large gluon shadowing,
large nonlinearities in parton evolution, small $x$ color transparency in the
vector meson production followed by color opacity at $x\le .005$, large
probability of inclusive diffraction. Implications for the nucleus-nucleus
