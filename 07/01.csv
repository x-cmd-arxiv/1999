a period of exponential expansion in the early universe responsible for the
large scale homogeneity and flatness of our observable patch of the universe. A
spectrum of density perturbations, seen in the microwave background as
temperature anisotropies, could have been produced during inflation from
quantum fluctuations that were stretched to cosmological size by the expansion,
and later gave rise, via gravitational collapse, to the observed large scale
structure of clusters and superclusters of galaxies. Furthermore, the same
theory predicts that all the matter and radiation in the universe today
originated at the end of inflation from an explosive production of particles
that could also have been the origin of the present baryon asymmetry, before
the universe reached thermal equilibrium at a very large temperature. From
there on, the universe cooled down as it expanded, in the way described by the
standard hot big bang model. With the observations that will soon become
available in the next millenium, we will be able to test the validity of the

a short central bar and extended spiral arms, both reaching far beyond the
optical component. We use Tremaine & Weinberg (1984) method to measure the
pattern speed of the bar from HI radio synthesis data. Our measurements yield a
pattern speed of 0.21+/-0.06 km/s/arcsec (8.0+/-2.4 km/s/kpc for D=5.3 Mpc), in
disagreement with the general view that corotation in barred disks lies just
outside the end of the bar, but consistent with recent models of barred
galaxies with dense dark matter halos. Our adopted bar semi-length puts
corotation at more than 1.7 bar radii. The existence of the pattern is also
problematic. Because NGC 2915 is isolated, interactions cannot account for the
structure observed in the HI disk. We also demonstrate that the low observed
disk surface density and the location of the pseudo-rings make it unlikely that
swing amplification or bar-driven spiral arms could explain the bar and spiral
pattern.
  Based on the similarity of the dark matter and HI surface density profiles,
we discuss the possibility of dark matter distributed in a disk and following
closely the HI distribution. The disk then becomes unstable and can naturally
form a bar and spiral pattern. However, this explanation is hard to reconcile
with some properties of NGC 2915. We also consider the effect of a massive and
extended triaxial dark matter halo with a rotating figure. The existence of
such halos is supported by CDM simulations showing strongly triaxial dark halos
with slow figure rotation. The observed structure of the HI disk can then arise
through forcing by the rotating triaxial figure. We associate the measured
pattern speed in NGC 2915 with the figure rotation of its dark halo.

first four moments of the color distributions, as well as a measure for their
non--unimodality. The number of globular clusters in each galaxy ranges from 18
(in NGC 2778) to 781 (NGC 5846). For those systems having more than 100
clusters, seven of sixteen (44%) show significant bimodality. Overall, roughly
half of all the systems in our sample show hints of a bimodal color
distribution. In general, the distributions of the faint galaxies are
consistent with unimodality, whereas those of the brighter galaxies are not. In
comparing the moments of the V-I distributions with various galaxy properties
for the early-type galaxies, we find the following difference in the
correlations between the field and cluster galaxy populations: the peak V-I
color of the globular cluster distribution correlates well with the central
velocity dispersion---and hence the Mg2 index and total luminosity---for
galaxies in cluster environments; there exists no such correlation for field
galaxies. This difference between cluster and field galaxies possibly reflects
different formation scenarios for their globular cluster systems. Among the
explanations for such a correlation, we consider either a larger age spread in
the field populations or the possibility that cluster galaxies are always
affected by significant accretion whereas some field galaxies could host pure
``in situ'' formed populations.

some of GRBs emit quite a large amount of energy, and total energy release from
GRBs seems to change from burst to burst by a factor of 10^{2-3} as E_{gamma,
iso} \sim 10^{52-55} erg, where E_{gamma, iso} is the observed GRB energy when
radiation is isotropic. If all GRBs are triggered by similar events, such a
wide dispersion in energy release seems odd. Here we propose a unified picture
for these various energetics of GRBs, in which all GRB events release roughly
the same amount of energy of E_{iso} \sim 10^{55-56} erg as relativistic
motion, with the baryon load problem almost resolved. A mild dispersion in the
initial Lorentz factor (\Gamma) results in difference of E_{gamma, iso} up to a
factor of m_p/m_e \sim 10^3. Protons work as ``a hidden energy reservoir'' of
the total GRB energy, and E_{gamma, iso} depends on the energy transfer
efficiency from protons into electrons (or positrons) in the internal shock. We
show that this transfer occurs via e^{+-} pair-creation by very high energy
photons of proton-synchrotron radiation, and this efficiency depends quite
sensitively on \Gamma. We also show that, in spite of the wide dispersion in
E_{gamma, iso}, this model predicts roughly a constant photon energy range of
the e^{+-} pair-synchrotron at \sim MeV, which is well consistent with GRB
observations. The optical flash of GRB 990123 can be explained by the internal
shock origin in our model. The apparent no-correlation between E_{gamma, iso}
and observed afterglow luminosity is consistent with the expectation of our
scenario.

circulation of the ISM and metals following the starburst. We assume a
single-phase rotating ISM in equilibrium in the galactic potential generated by
a stellar disk and a spherical dark halo. The starburst is assumed to occur in
a small volume in the center of the galaxy, and it generates a mechanical power
of 3.8e39 erg/s or 3.8e40 erg/s for 30 Myr. We found, consistently with
previous investigations, that the galactic wind is not very effective in
removing the ISM. The metal rich stellar ejecta, instead, may be efficiently
expelled from the galaxy and dispersed in the intergalactic medium. Moreover,
we found that the central region of the galaxy is always replenished with cold
and dense gas after a few 100 Myr from the starbust, achieving the requisite
for a new star formation event in 0.5-1 Gyr. The hydrodynamical evolution of
galactic winds is thus consistent with the episodic star formation regime
suggested by many chemical evolution studies. We also discuss the X-ray
emission of these galaxies and find that the observable (emission averaged)
abundance of the hot gas underestimates the real one if thermal conduction is
effective. This could explain the very low hot gas metallicities estimated in
starburst galaxies.

possible, the HRI has been used in order to take advantage of the higher

to radial profiles in order to separate the resolved and unresolved X-ray

5-GHz luminosities of the radio cores in this sample. This suggests a physical
relationship between the soft X-ray emission of radio galaxies and the
jet-generated radio core emission. We infer a nuclear jet-related origin for at

its terminal velocity, V_{tr}. In the general case the latter is determined

extreme limits of slow and fast monolayer particles diffusion, we obtain

tracer the local density is higher than the average value, \rho_L, and
approaches \rho_L as an exponential function of the distance from the tracer.
Past the tracer the local density is lower than \rho_L and the approach to
\rho_L may proceed differently depending whether the particles number in the
monolayer is not or is explicitly conserved. In the former case the approach is
described by an exponential dependence with a different characteristic length,
compared to the behavior in front of the tracer; in the latter case, the
density tends to \rho_L algebraically. The characteristic lengths and the

$l\neq0$, these fall into two phases, weak and strong pairing, which may be
distinguished topologically. In the cases with conserved spin, we derive
explicitly the Hall conductivity for spin as the corresponding topological
invariant. For the spinless p-wave case, the weak-pairing phase has a pair
wavefunction that is asympototically the same as that in the Moore-Read
(Pfaffian) quantum Hall state, and we argue that its other properties (edge
states, quasihole and toroidal ground states) are also the same, indicating
that nonabelian statistics is a {\em generic} property of such a paired phase.
The strong-pairing phase is an abelian state, and the transition between the
two phases involves a bulk Majorana fermion, the mass of which changes sign at
the transition. For the d-wave case, we argue that the Haldane-Rezayi state is
not the generic behavior of a phase but describes the asymptotics at the
critical point between weak and strong pairing, and has gapless fermion
excitations in the bulk. In this case the weak-pairing phase is an abelian
phase which has been considered previously. In the p-wave case with an unbroken
U(1) symmetry, which can be applied to the double layer quantum Hall problem,
the weak-pairing phase has the properties of the 331 state, and with nonzero

pairing energy for conventional superconductors is wavevector-independent. The

transition. A transition from the Goldstone phase to the symmetric phase is
expected as the number of fermions N_f is increased to some critical value.
Various investigations have suggested that a parity-doubled spectrum develops
as the critical value is approached. Using an effective Lagrangian as a guide,
we note that parity doubling is associated with the appearance of an enhanced
global symmetry in the spectrum of the theory. The enhanced symmetry would
develop as the spectrum splits into two sectors, with the first exhibiting the
usual pattern of a spontaneously broken chiral symmetry, and the second
exhibiting an additional, unbroken symmetry and parity doubling. The first
sector includes the Goldstone bosons and other states such as massive scalar
partners. The second includes a parity-degenerate vector and axial vector along
with other possible parity partners. We note that if such a near-critical
theory describes symmetry breaking in the electroweak theory, the additional
symmetry suppresses the contribution of the parity doubled sector to the S
parameter.

theory. One of the most appealing of these is the racetrack mechanism, in which
a delicate interplay between two strongly interacting gauge groups fixes the
value of the coupling constant. In this note, we explore this scenario. We find
that quite generally, some number of discrete tunings are required in order
that the mechanism yield a small gauge coupling. Even then, there is no sense
in which a weak coupling approximation is valid. On the other hand, certain
holomorphic quantities can be computed, so such a scheme is in principle
predictive. Searching for models which realize this mechanism is thus of great
interest. We also remark on cosmology in these schemes.

Polyakov-Weigmann cocycle describing their interactions. This is an effective
action for free fermions on a torus with nontrivial boundary conditions. It is
universal in the sense that all other known integrable models can be derived as
reductions of this model. Hence our motivation is to present an unified
description of different integrable models. We present a proof of this
universal action from the action of the trivial dynamical system on the
cotangent bundles of the loop group. We also present some examples of

in that gate, the so-called ""spectator"" spins; they must be returned to their
initial states at the end of the sequence. As a result, a homonuclear spin
system where there is appreciable coupling between every pair of spins would
seem to require a refocusing scheme that doubles in complexity and duration for
every additional spectator spin. Fortunately, for the more realistic practical
case where long-range spin-spin couplings can be neglected, simpler refocusing
schemes can be devised where the overall duration of the sequence remains
