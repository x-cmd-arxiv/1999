large-scale line-profile and/or photometric patterns of variability displayed
by some apparently single Wolf-Rayet stars, with the existence of an unseen
(collapsed?) companion or of spatially extended wind structures as potential
candidates. We present observations of WR 1 which highlight the unusual
character of the variations in this object. Our narrowband photometric
observations reveal a gradual increase of the stellar continuum flux amounting
to Delta v = 0.09 mag followed by a decline on about the same timescale (3-4
days). Only marginal evidence for variability is found during the 11 following
nights.
  Strong, daily line-profile variations are also observed but they cannot be
easily linked to the photometric variations.
  Similarly to the continuum flux variations, coherent time-dependent changes
are observed in 1996 in the centroid, equivalent width, and skewness of He II
4686. Despite the generally coherent nature of the variations, we do not find
evidence in our data for the periods claimed in previous studies. While the
issue of a cyclical pattern of variability in WR 1 is still controversial, it
is clear that this object might constitute in the future a cornerstone for our
understanding of the mechanisms leading to the formation of largely anisotropic
outflows in Wolf-Rayet stars.

systems containing a fluid star (mass $m$ and radius $R_0$) and a Kerr black
hole (mass $M$) in circular orbit. We consider the limit $M\gg m$ where
spacetime is described by the Kerr metric. The tidally deformed star is
approximated by an ellipsoid, and satisfies the polytropic equation of state.
The models also include fluid motion in the stellar interior, allowing binary
models with nonsynchronized stellar spin (as expected for coalescing neutron
star-black hole binaries) to be constructed. Tidal disruption occurs at orbital
radius $r_{\rm tide}\sim R_0(M/m)^{1/3}$, but the dimensionless ratio $\hat
r_{\rm tide}=r_{\rm tide}/[R_0(M/m)^{1/3}]$ depends on the spin parameter of
the black hole as well as on the equation of state and the internal rotation of
the star. We find that the general relativistic tidal field disrupts the star
at a larger $\hat r_{\rm tide}$ than the Newtonian tide; the difference is
particularly prominent if the disruption occurs in the vicinity of the black
hole's horizon. In general, $\hat r_{\rm tide}$ is smaller for a (prograde
rotating) Kerr black hole than for a Schwarzschild black hole. We apply our
results to coalescing black hole-neutron star and black hole-white dwarf
binaries. The tidal disruption limit is important for characterizing the
expected gravitational wave signals and is relevant for determining the
energetics of gamma ray bursts which may result from such disruption.

northern OR expanding along the line of sight at about 26 km/s, and for the
southern OR, about 23 km/s. Similar results are found with CTIO 4m data.
Accounting for inclination, the best fit to all data show both ORs with an
expansion from the SN of 26 km/s. The ratio of the ER to OR velocities is
nearly equal to the ratio of ER to OR radii, so the rings are roughly
homologous, all having kinematic ages corresponding to about 20,000 yr before
the SN explosion. This makes previously reported, large compositional
differences between the ER and ORs difficult to understand. Additionally, a
grid of longslit 4m/echelle spectra centered on the SN shows two velocity
components over a region roughly coextensive with the outer circumstellar
envelope extending about 5 pc (20 arcsec) from the SN. One component is
blueshifted and the other redshifted from the SN centroid by about 10 km/s

relation similar to that of black holes produced in asymptotically flat
spacetime. Distinct from PBHs formed with mass about the horizon mass (Type I),
the PBHs with the scaling relation (Type II) can be created with a range of
masses at a given formation time. In general, only the case in which the PBH
formation is concentrated at one epoch has been considered. However, it is
expected that PBH formation is possible over a broad range of epochs if the
density fluctuation has a rather large amplitude and smooth scale dependence.
In this paper, we study the PBH formation for both types assuming the power
spectrum of double inflationary models in which the small scale fluctuations
could have large amplitudes independent of the CMBR anisotropy. The mass
spectrum of Type II PBHs is newly constructed without limiting the PBH
formation period. The double inflationary power spectrum is assumed to be of
double simple power-law which are smoothly connected. Under the assumed power
spectrum, the accumulation of small PBHs formed at later times is important and
the mass range is significantly broadened for both Types. The PBH mass spectra
are far smoother than the observed MACHO spectrum due to our assumption of a
smooth spectrum. In order to fit the observation, a more spiky spectrum is
required.

have problems, due to the very short cooling times of the emitting electrons,
which implies a predicted spectrum F(nu) proportional to nu^(-1/2), much
steeper than what is observed. It is therefore compelling to look for
alternative emission processes, such as quasi-thermal Comptonization, implying
the presence of mildly or sub-relativistic electrons, producing, through
multiple Compton scatterings, a spectrum proportional to nu^0 ending with a
Wien peak where photons and electron energies balance. The afterglow light,
instead, can be indeed due to synchrotron radiation, and a confirmation of this
is the recently detected optical linear polarization of the afterglow of GRB
990510. Some consequences of this discovery will be outlined. A quantum leap in
our understanding of the physics of gamma-ray bursts is expected to come with

large amplitude luminosity variability, associated with spectacular spectral
changes, particularly when compared to the last observation when the source was

scattering of low energy seed photons and our observations provide the first
reliable detection of correlated variations in 3C273 between the X-ray band and

that it is probable that each decade of the seed photon distribution from the
mm to IR waveband contributes roughly equally to the medium energy X-ray flux.

simplifications are also explored: a cylindrical gravitational potential (the
``cylindrical disk''), and axisymmetry. The results from those simulations are
compared with fully three dimensional global simulations. The global
simulations investigate initial equilibrium pressure supported accretion tori
with two different initial field geometries: poloidal fields that are constant
along initial equidensity surfaces, and toroidal fields with a constant ratio
of gas to magnetic pressure. In both cases the magnetorotational instability
rapidly develops, and the torus becomes turbulent. The resulting turbulence
transports angular momentum, and the torus develops an angular momentum
distribution that is near Keplerian.

Farey sequences, are not smooth neither continuous. Instead they are deformed
and broken in regions characterised by high Lyapunov Characteristic Numbers

repeller, as discussed by Gaspard and Baras (1995), and are thus closely

argued that the fractal properties of the phase space should affect the

shown that correlation effects in the underlying itinerant electron system lead
to singularities in the order parameter field theory that result in an
effective long-range interaction between the spin fluctuations. This
interaction turns out to be generically {\em antiferromagnetic} for clean
systems. In disordered systems analogous correlation effects lead to even
stronger singularities. The resulting long-range interaction is, however,
generically ferromagnetic.
  We discuss two possibilities for the ferromagnetic quantum phase transition.
In clean systems, the transition is generically of first order, as is
experimentally observed in MnSi. However, under certain conditions the
transition may be continuous with non-mean field critical behavior. In
disordered systems, one finds a very rich phase diagram showing first order and
continuous phase transitions and several multicritical points.

that for every fixed bandwidth there exist functions which pass through any
finite number of arbitrarily prespecified points. Further, we show that, in
spite of the presence of superoscillations, the behavior of bandlimited
functions can be characterized reliably, namely through an uncertainty
relation. This also generalizes to time-varying bandwidths. In QFT, we identify

we show that, generically, the ``ingoing'' ($s>0$) component of the perturbing
field dies off along the EH more rapidly than its ``outgoing'' ($s<0$)
counterpart. Thus, while along $r=const>2M$ lines both components of the
perturbation admit the well-known $t^{-2l-3}$ decay rate, one finds that along
the EH the $s<0$ component dies off in advanced-time $v$ as $v^{-2l-3}$,
whereas the $s>0$ component dies off as $v^{-2l-4}$. We then describe the
extension of this analysis to a Kerr black hole. We conclude that for axially
symmetric modes the situation is analogous to the Schwarzschild case. However,
for non-axially symmetric modes both $s>0$ and $s<0$ fields decay at the same
rate (unlike in the Schwarzschild case).

t^2$ with $\mu$ the string tension per unit length and the scaling parameter,
$\xi \sim (0.9-1.3)$, irrespective of the cosmic time. We also find that the
loop distribution function can be fitted with that predicted by the so-called
one scale model. Concretely, the number density, $n_{l}(t)$, of the loop with
the length, $l$, is given by $n_{l}(t) = \nu/[t^{3/2} (l + \kappa t)^{5/2}]$
where $\nu \sim 0.0865$ and $\kappa$ is related with the Nambu-Goldstone(NG)
boson radiation power from global strings, $P$, as $P = \kappa \mu$ with
$\kappa \sim 0.535$. Therefore, the loop production function also scales and

or superstring theories, predict the presence of particles with weak scale
masses and Planck-suppressed couplings. Typical examples are the scalar moduli
and the gravitino. Excessive production of such particles in the early Universe
destroys the successful predictions of nucleosynthesis. In particular, the
thermal production of these relics after inflation leads to a bound on the
reheating temperature, T_{RH} < 10^9 GeV. In this paper we show that the
non-thermal generation of these dangerous relics may be much more efficient
than the thermal production after inflation. Scalar moduli fields may be
copiously created by the classical gravitational effects on the vacuum state.
Consequently, the new upper bound on the reheating temperature is shown to be,
in some cases, as low as 100 GeV. We also study the non-thermal production of
gravitinos in the early Universe, which can be extremely efficient and overcome
the thermal production by several orders of magnitude, in realistic

singularity. We deduce the field content and lagrangian of such theories and
present a systematic method for mapping the moment map levels characterizing
the partial resolutions of the singularity to the Fayet-Iliopoulos parameters
of the D-brane worldvolume theory. As opposed to the simpler cases studied
before, we find a complex web of partial resolutions and associated
field-theoretic Fayet-Iliopoulos deformations. The analysis is performed by
toric methods, leading to a structure which can be efficiently described in the
language of convex geometry. For the worldvolume theory, the analysis of the
moduli space has an elegant description in terms of quivers. As a by-product,
we present a systematic way of extracting the birational geometry of the
classical moduli spaces, thus generalizing previous work on resolution of
singularities by D-branes.

Skyrmions can be captured by the domain walls. We show also that, when the mass

the domain wall. They look like deformed 2-dimensional Skyrmions captured by
the wall. The field configurations of these solutions can interpreted as having
come from the evolution of the 3-dimensional Skyrmions captured by the domain
wall. For more conventional choices of the mass term of the model in the model
the attraction between the Skyrmions and the wall leads to the capture of the
Skyrmions which are then turned into topological waves which spread out on the

group then the group is infinite cyclic. We show that for any classical knot
group there is a virtual knot with that group and trivial longitude. It is well
known that the second homology of a classical knot group is trivial. We provide
counterexamples of this for virtual knots.

operators of arbitrary order is obtained. This solution is closely related to
the ``Q condition'' of A.J.Coleman. The representability conditions are
formulated in orbital representation and are easy to use. They are tested
numerically on the base of CI calculation of simple atomic and molecular
systems. General scheme of construction of the contraction operator right
inverses is proposed and the explicit expression for the right inverse
associated with the expansion operator is derived as an example. Two algorithms
for direct 2-density matrix determination are described.

  (v2 with tiny changes and typo corrections)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Clifford algebras are used for definition of spinors. Because of using
spin-1/2 systems as an adequate model of quantum bit, a relation of the
algebras with quantum information science has physical reasons. But there are
simple mathematical properties of the algebras those also justifies such
applications.
  First, any complex Clifford algebra with 2n generators, Cl(2n,C), has
representation as algebra of all 2^n x 2^n complex matrices and so includes
unitary matrix of any quantum n-gate. An arbitrary element of whole algebra
corresponds to general form of linear complex transformation. The last property
is also useful because linear operators are not necessary should be unitary if
they used for description of restriction of some unitary operator to subspace.
  The second advantage is simple algebraic structure of Cl(2n) that can be
expressed via tenzor product of standard ""building units"" and similar with
behavior of composite quantum systems. The compact notation with 2n generators
also can be used in software for modeling of simple quantum circuits by modern
conventional computers.

coherent or incoherent pump. We consider both three- and four-level gain
schemes, and examine the output spectrum of such lasers. We find that the
linewidth generally scales as the inverse of the photon number. For large
atom-field coupling, a vacuum-Rabi doublet structure is obtained. In the
three-level case, this vacuum-Rabi splitting is apparent only for small
intracavity photon numbers, and vanishes for large pumps. In the four-level
scheme, the vacuum-Rabi structure appears at a nonzero pump level, and is
maintained for large pumps, even when the intracavity photon number is larger
than unity. This behavior is explained utilizing the quantum trajectory
approach.

exponential behavior of the error probability, are the most important
quantitative characteristics of the channel performance. From a general point
of view, these bounds provide certain measures of distinguishability of a given
set of states. In an earlier paper we introduced quantum analogs of the random
coding and the expurgation lower bounds for the case of pure signal states.
Here we discuss the general case, in particular, we prove the previously
conjectured expurgation bound and find the quantum cutoff rate in the case of
arbitrary mixed signal states.

Fidelity can be interpreted as the probability that a decoded message possesses
the same information content as the message prior to coding and transmission.
In this paper, we give a formula of Bures fidelity for displaced squeezed
thermal states directly by the displacement and squeezing parameters and
birefly discuss how the results can apply to quantum information theory.
