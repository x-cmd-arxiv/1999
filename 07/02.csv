did not detect emission in the most distant galaxy or in the 2 Seyfert 1
galaxies in our sample because of the luminosity of the nuclear point sources.
In NGC 5643, NGC 2110 and MKN 1066, molecular hydrogen emission is detected in
the extended narrow line region on scales of a few hundred pc from the nucleus.
Emission is coincident with [OIII] and H alpha+[NII] line emission. This
emission is also near dust lanes observed in the visible to near-infrared color
maps suggesting that a multiphase medium exists near the ionization cones and
that the morphology of the line emission is dependent on the density of the
ambient media. The high 1-0 S(1) or S(3) H2 to H alpha flux ratio suggests that
shock excitation of molecular hydrogen (rather than UV fluorescence) is the
dominant excitation process in these extended features. In NGC 2992 and NGC
3227 the molecular hydrogen emission is from 800 and 100 pc diameter `disks'
(respectively) which are not directly associated with [OIII] emission and are
near high levels of extinction (AV > 10). In NGC 4945 the molecular hydrogen
emission appears to be from the edge of a 100 pc superbubble. In these 3
galaxies the molecular gas could be excited by processes associated with local
star formation. We confirm previous spectroscopic studies finding that no
single mechanism is likely to be responsible for the molecular hydrogen
excitation in Seyfert galaxies.

broad-band properties of High-Energy Peaked (HBL) BL Lacs we have statistically
identified a sample of 218 objects that is expected to include about 85% of BL
Lacs and that is therefore several times larger than all other published
samples of HBLs. Using a subset (155 objects) that is radio flux limited and
statistically well-defined we have derived the \vovm distribution and the
LogN-LogS of extreme HBLs (fx/fr >= 3E-10 erg/cm2/s/Jansky) down to 3.5 mJy. We
find that the LogN-LogS flattens around 20 mJy and that <V/Vm> = 0.42 +/- 0.02.
This extends to the radio band earlier results, based on much smaller X-ray
selected samples, about the anomalous cosmological observational properties of
HBL BL Lacs. A comparison with the expected radio LogN-LogS of all BL Lacs
(based on a beaming model) shows that extreme HBLs make up roughly 2% of the BL
Lac population, independently of radio flux. This result, together with the
flatness of the radio logN-logS at low fluxes, is in contrast with the
predictions of a recent model which assumes an anti-correlation between peak
frequency and bolometric luminosity. The extreme fx/fr flux ratios and high
X-ray fluxes of these BL Lacs makes them good candidate TeV sources, some of

chain Ni56-Co56-Fe56 usually directly powers the UV/optical/IR (UVOIR)
bolometric luminosity of supernovae in their quasi-steady state phase until
very late times. The result for this phase is exponential/quasi-exponential
UVOIR bolometric light curves and often exponential/quasi-exponential broad

treatment of RDE deposition that provides a straightforward understanding of
the exponential/quasi-exponential behavior of the UVOIR bolometric luminosity
and a partial understanding of the exponential/quasi-exponential behavior of
the broad band light curves. The treatment reduces to using a normalized
deposition function N_{Ni}^{*}(t) as an analysis tool. The one free parameter
of N_{Ni}^{*}(t) is a fiducial time t_{0} which governs time-varying gamma-ray
optical depth behavior of a supernova. The N_{Ni}^{*}(t) function is used to
analyze the preliminary UVOIR bolometric light curve of SN Ic 1998bw (the
possible cause of gamma-ray burst GRB980425). The SN 1998bw t_{0} is found to
be 134.42 days and a prediction is made for the evolution of the SN 1998bw RDE
deposition curve and quasi-steady state UVOIR bolometric light curve out to day

from the light curve analysis is 4.26 M_{Sun}. As further examples of the
simple analytic treatment, the RDE deposition and luminosity evolution of SN Ia
1992A and SN II 1987A have also been examined. The simple analytic treatment of
RDE deposition has actually existed for 20 years at least without, apparently,

enough to cause planetesimals to graze or impact the star. We integrate
numerically the motions of particles which pass through the 3:1 or 4:1 mean
motion resonances of a migrating Jupiter mass planet. We find that many
particles can be trapped in the 3:1 or 4:1 resonances and pumped to high enough
eccentricities that they impact the star. This implies that for a planet
migrating a substantial fraction of its semi major axis, a significant fraction
of its mass in planetesimals could impact the star. This process may be capable
of enriching the metallicity of the star, and at a time when the star is no
longer fully convective. Upon close approaches to the star the surfaces of
these planetesimals will be sublimated. Orbital migration should cause
continuing production of evaporating bodies, suggesting that this process
should be detectable with searches for transient absorption lines in young
stars. The remainder of the particles will not impact the star but can be
subsequently ejected by the planet as it migrates further inwards. This allows
the planet to migrate a substantial fraction of its initial semi-major axis via
ejection of planetesimals.

data to the star formation rate suggests that high resolution radio continuum
maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy could be exploited to locate submm
sources. We targeted with SCUBA a sample of micro-Jy radio sources in the
flanking fields of the Hubble Deep Field selected from the uniform (8 micro-Jy
at 1-sigma) 1.4 GHz VLA image of Richards (1999). We find that the majority of
bright (>6 mJy) submm sources have detectable radio counterparts. With the
precise positions from the radio, we also find that these submm sources are
extremely faint in the optical and NIR (I>>24 and K=21-22) and are therefore
inaccessible to optical spectroscopy. Redshift estimates can, however, be made
from the shape of the spectral energy distribution in the radio and submm. This
procedure, which we refer to as millimetric redshift estimation, places the
bright submm population at z=1-3, where it forms the high redshift tail of the

thin thermal continuum emission by these particles can balance cosmic-ray

the known heating rate in the disk sets a minimum mass of order 10^-6 Msun

about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. It
combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption
that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. While the
predicted mass function is reasonably accurate at the high mass end, it has
more low mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering.
This discrepancy can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed
to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical collapse. In the spherical
model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold
value, delta_sc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region,
and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size,
delta_sc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse
of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial
overdensity. Therefore, there is a relation between the density threshold value
required for collapse, and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting
function to this delta_ec(m) relation for initially Gaussian fields which
simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach.
We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo
distribution in high resolution N-body simulations, and show that our simple
parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents a significant
improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we
show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the
large scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the
standard predictions.

10^5M_\odot$. Beginning with a idealized model of a Reissner-Nordstrom EMBH
with charge to mass ratio $\xi=0.1$, numerical hydrodynamic calculations are
made to model the expansion of the pair-electromagnetic pulse (PEM pulse) to
the point that the system is transparent to photons. Three idealized special
relativistic models have been compared and contrasted with the results of the
numerically integrated general relativistic hydrodynamic equations. One of the
three models has been validated: a PEM pulse of constant thickness in the
laboratory frame is shown to be in excellent agreement with results of the
general relativistic hydrodynamic code. It is remarkable that this precise
model, starting from the fundamental parameters of the EMBH, leads uniquely to
the explicit evaluation of the parameters of the PEM pulse, including the
energy spectrum and the astrophysically unprecedented large Lorentz factors (up
to $6\cdot 10^3$ for a $10^3 M_{\odot}$ EMBH). The observed photon energy at
the peak of the photon spectrum at the moment of photon decoupling is shown to
range from 0.1 MeV to 4 MeV as a function of the EMBH mass. Correspondingly the
total energy in photons is in the range of $10^{52}$ to $10^{54}$ ergs,
consistent with observed gamma-ray bursts. In these computations we neglect the
presence of baryonic matter which will be the subject of forthcoming
publications.

unit on a single optical chip. Integrated optics are compact, provide
stability, low sensitivity to external constrains like temperature, pressure or
mechanical stresses, no optical alignment except for coupling, simplicity and
intrinsic polarization control. The integrated optics devices are inexpensive
compared to devices that have the same functionalities in bulk optics. We think
integrated optics will fundamentally change single-mode interferometry.
Integrated optics devices are in particular well-suited for interferometric
combination of numerous beams to achieve aperture synthesis imaging or for
space-based interferometers where stability and a minimum of optical alignments

star-forming galaxy yet detected (~10^42 ergs/s). Long-slit optical
spectroscopy and a deep, high-resolution ROSAT X-ray image show that the
starburst is driving a ""superwind"" which accounts for ~20% of the observed soft
(kT~0.3 keV) X-ray emission. Our model for the broadband X-ray emission of
NGC3256 contains two additional components: a warm thermal plasma (kT~0.8 keV)
associated with the central starburst, and a hard power-law component with an
energy index of ~0.7. We find that the input of mechanical energy from the
starburst is more than sufficient to sustain the observed level of emission. We
also examine possible origins for the power-law component, concluding that
neither a buried AGN nor the expected population of high-mass X-ray binaries
can account for this emission. Inverse-Compton scattering, involving the
galaxy's copious flux of infrared photons and the relativistic electrons
produced by supernovae, is likely to make a substantial contribution to the
hard X-ray flux. Such a model is consistent with the observed radio and IR
fluxes and the radio and X-ray spectral indices. We explore the role of
X-ray-luminous starbursts in the production of the cosmic X-ray background
radiation. The number counts and spectral index distribution of the faint radio
source population, thought to be dominated by star-forming galaxies, suggest
that a significant fraction of the hard X-ray background could arise from
starbursts at moderate redshift.

XY-model coupled to lattice gauge field $a_{\mu}$ with coupling $g$, is studied
taking into account both the instantons and vortices. This model corresponds to
integer filling of the bosons, and can be mapped to a dual superconductor. Our
main resut is that the instantons introduce a term which couples linearly to
the dual superconductor order parameter, and tend to pin its phase. As a result
the vortex condensation always occurs due to the instantons, and the Meissner
effect for the gauge field $a_\mu$ is absent, although $a_{\mu}$ is massive.
This state is essentially the same as the confining phase of the pure gauge
model. Away from integer filling, a ``magnetic field'' $\mu$ (the chemical
potential of the bosons) is applied to this dual superconductor. Then the Higgs
phase revives in the case of weak $g$ and large $x$, where vortices do not
condense in spite of the instantons. In the opposite case, i.e., strong $g$ and
small $x$, phase separation occurs, forming either microscopic patches or
macroscopic stripe domains of the Mott insulating state.

shown to give the expected results for the homogeneous case at zero

these diagrams if summed properly will solve a ln T anomaly in the specific

can be generated by imposing non-universal GUT scale scalar masses consistent
with universality within SO(10) plus extra $D$-term contributions associated
with the reduction in rank of the gauge symmetry group when SO(10)
spontaneously breaks to $SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)$. We comment upon the
consequences of the sparticle mass spectrum for collider searches for
supersymmetry. One implication of SO(10) unification is that the light bottom
squark can be by far the lightest of the squarks. This motivates a dedicated
search for bottom squark pair production at $p\bar{p}$ and $e^+e^-$ colliders.

counting special Lagrangian rational homology 3-spheres N in M in each
3-homology class, with a certain weight w(N) depending on the topology of N.
This is motivated by the Gromov-Witten invariants of a symplectic manifold,
which count the J-holomorphic curves in each 2-homology class.
  In order for this invariant to be interesting, it should either be unchanged
by deformations of the underlying (almost) Calabi-Yau structure, or else
transform according to some rigid set of rules as the periods of the almost
Calabi-Yau structure pass through some topologically determined hypersurfaces
in the cohomology of M.
  As we deform the underlying almost Calabi-Yau 3-fold, the collection of
special Lagrangian homology 3-spheres only change when they become singular.
Thus, to determine the stability of the invariant under deformations we need
know about the singular behaviour of special Lagrangian 3-folds, which is not
well understood.
  We describe two kinds of singular behaviour of special Lagrangian 3-folds,
and derive identities on the weight function w(N) for I to be unchanged or
transform well under them. The weight function w(N)=|H_1(N,Z)| satisfies these
identities. We conjecture that an invariant I defined with this weight is
independent of the Kahler class, and changes in certain ways as the holomorphic
3-form passes through some real hypersurfaces in H^3(M,C).
  Finally we consider connections with String Theory. We argue that our
invariant I counts isolated 3-branes, and that it should play a part in the
Mirror Symmetry story for Calabi-Yau 3-folds.

  2000.",,,"math.OA math.DG",,"  In Alain Connes noncommutative geometry, the question of the existence of a
non-trivial integral can be described in terms of the singular traceability of
the compact operator |D|^(-d), D being the Dirac operator, namely of the
existence of a finite non-trivial singular trace on the ideal generated by
|D|^(-d). A condition on the non triviality of the Dixmier logarithmic trace on
the above mentioned ideal has been given by Connes in terms of the
cohomological dimension of the Chern character of the phase of D. In this paper
we show that, under suitable regularity conditions on the eigenvalue sequence
of |D|, the dimension d can be uniquely determined by imposing that |D|^(-d) is
singularly traceable, thus providing a geometric measure theoretic definition
for d. More precisely, defining d as the inverse of the polynomial order of
|D|^(-1), the operator |D|^(-d) always produces a singular trace which gives
rise to a non-trivial integration procedure, even when the logarithmic trace
fails. In the second part of the paper we discuss large scale counterparts of
the geometric measure theoretic dimension for the case of covering manifolds.
We prove that in the case of the coverings studied by Atiyah, the inverse of
the polynomial order at 0 of Delta_p^(-1/2), defined via the Atiyah trace,
coincides with the Novikov-Shubin number alpha_p. As a consequence, Novikov-
Shubin numbers can be considered as (asymptotic) dimensions in the sense of
geometric measure theory, since the corresponding power of Delta_p^(-1/2)
produces a singular trace. Generalizations of the mentioned results on covering
manifolds to the case of open manifolds with bounded geometry are studied in

g > 23 the moduli space is of general type, while for g\leq 22, Harris and
Morrison conjectured that M_g is uniruled. The result on M_{23} is obtained by
investigating the relative position of three explicit multicanonical divisors
which are of Brill-Noether type.

elliptic curves in an attempt to mimic the familiar toral automorphisms. At the
non-archimedean primes, a continuous map is constructed on the local elliptic
curve whose topological entropy is given by the local canonical height. Also, a
precise formula for the periodic points is given. There follows a discussion of
how these local results may be glued together to give a map on the adelic
curve. We are able to give a map whose entropy is the global canonical height
and whose periodic points are counted asymptotically by the real division
polynomial (although the archimedean component of the map is artificial).
Finally, we set out a precise conjecture about the existence of elliptic
dynamical systems and discuss a possible connection with mathematical physics.

'mutually braided' in the sense of Rudolph. It deals with closed braids which

a close control on the way in which the whole family of fibre surfaces meet the
family of discs spanning the braid axis. We show how such a braid can be
presented naturally as a word in the `band generators' of the braid group
discussed by Birman, Ko and Lee in their recent account of the band
presentation of the braid groups. In this context we are able to convert the
conditions for mutual braiding into the existence of a suitable sequence of
band relations and other moves on the braid word, and derive a combinatorial
method for deciding whether a braid is mutually braided.

incompressible flows [H. Tasso and G. N. Throumoulopoulos, Phys. Plasmas {\bf
5}, 2378 (1998)] is extended to the generic case of helically symmetric
equilibria with incompressible flows. It is shown that the equilibrium states
of the system under consideration are governed by an elliptic partial
differential equation for the helical magnetic flux function $\psi$ containing
five surface quantities along with a relation for the pressure. The above
mentioned equation can be transformed to one possessing differential part
identical in form to the corresponding static equilibrium equation, which is
amenable to several classes of analytic solutions. In particular, equilibria
with electric fields perpendicular to the magnetic surfaces and
non-constant-Mach-number flows are constructed. Unlike the case in axisymmetric
equilibria with isothermal magnetic surfaces, helically symmetric $T=T(\psi)$
equilibria are over-determined, i.e., in this case the equilibrium equations
reduce to a set of eight ordinary differential equations with seven surface
quantities. In addition, it is proved the non-existence of incompressible
helically symmetric equilibria with (a) purely helical flows (b) non-parallel
flows with isothermal magnetic surfaces and the magnetic field modulus being a
surface quantity (omnigenous equilibria).

computation if it is switched on. Counterfactual computation is a process by
which the result of the computation may be learnt without actually running the
computer. Such processes are possible within quantum physics and to achieve
this effect, a computer embodying the possibility of running the computation
must be available, even though the computation is, in fact, not run. We study
the possibilities and limitations of general protocols for the counterfactual
computation of decision problems (where the result r is either 0 or 1). If p(r)
denotes the probability of learning the result r ``for free'' in a protocol
then one might hope to design a protocol which simultaneously has large p(0)
and p(1). However we prove that p(0)+p(1) never exceeds 1 in any protocol and
we derive further constraints on p(0) and p(1) in terms of N, the number of
times that the computer is not run. In particular we show that any protocol
with p(0)+p(1)=1-epsilon must have N tending to infinity as epsilon tends to 0.
These general results are illustrated with some explicit protocols for
counterfactual computation. We show that ""interaction-free"" measurements can be
regarded as counterfactual computations, and our results then imply that N must
be large if the probability of interaction is to be close to zero. Finally, we
consider some ways in which our formulation of counterfactual computation can
be generalised.
