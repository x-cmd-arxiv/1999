clustering objects is scale-independent on scales beyond galaxy clusters, and
may also be independent of the mass of the objects. In this paper, we show that
the scale behavior of $M/L$ ratio is closely related to the scaling of cosmic
structures larger than clusters. The scale dependence of the $M/L$ ratio can be
determined by comparing the observed scaling of richness function (RF) of
multi-scale identified objects with the model-predicted scaling of mass
function (MF) of large scale structures. Using the multi-scale identified
clusters from IRAS 1.2 Jy galaxy survey, we have made comparisons of the
observed RF scaling of IRAS $r_{cl}$-clusters with the MF scalings given by
simulations of three popular models SCDM, LCDM and OCDM. We find that, the M/L
ratio basically is scale-independent from the Abell radius up to about 24
$h^{-1}$Mpc, while it seems to show a slight, but systematical, increase over
this scale range. This result is weakly dependent on the cosmological
parameters.

PG1404+226 with ASCA and HST, and a re-analysis of our earlier observations
with ROSAT. The soft X-ray spectrum is very steep and displays an absorption
feature (edge or line at ~1.1 keV). We have applied a variety of models to the
ASCA and ROSAT spectra without finding a completely satisfactory fit, and the
identification of the edge remains uncertain. A satisfactory fit of the ASCA
spectrum assuming that the edge is produced by highly ionized iron (using the
code absori in XSPEC) is obtained with an overabundance of iron by a factor >
25 compared to solar, a suggestion supported by the extremely high equivalent
width of the Fe K_alpha line at 6.4 keV. A warm absorber model fitting the
absorption feature with NeVII-NeX edges and assuming a peculiar oxygen/neon
abundance ratio is consistent with the ROSAT data but not the ASCA data.
Finally, it is also possible that the observed edge is caused by a OVIII or
OVII edge or line, blueshifted by z_abs=0.2 to 0.5 depending on the specific
identification, as has been suggested previously for 2 other NL quasars, but
there are no other features in the UV and X-ray spectra in support of this
suggestion. Two systems of UV absorption lines, one nearly at rest in the
source frame, the other blueshifted by ~1900 km/s are identified in the HST/FOS
spectra.
  Photoionization models indicate that the UV absorption and the ~1 keV
absorption are probably caused by absorbers with different physical conditions.
PG1404+226 is one more case of AGN where both UV and X-ray absorption features
are detected, thereby increasing further the significance of the previously
noted statistical association of the two types of absorbers.

inadequate fit to the spectrum, in contrast to previous studies by Einstein and
Ginga. Although the 2-10 keV spectrum can be fit adequately with a
bremsstrahlung model with kT = 7.4 +/- 0.3 keV, an additional soft component
with kT = 0.38 +/- 0.03 keV is required to fit the spectrum below 2 keV. This
soft component comprises 38% +/- 6% of the total emission in the 0.1-2.0 keV
band, and possibly more depending on the absorption value used in the fit.
Since previous spatial studies of the bulge of M31 indicate that < 25% of the
X-ray emission from the bulge in this band is from a diffuse gaseous component,
this implies that stellar sources, namely low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), are
responsible for some if not all of the soft component. The spectral properties
of M31 are very similar to those of the X-ray faint early-type galaxy NGC4382.
This supports the claim that the unexplained soft X-ray emission seen
previously in these galaxies also emanates from LMXBs.

dwarf spheroidal galaxy reveal that the red horizonal branch (RHB) stars are
strongly concentrated towards the center of the galaxy relative to the dominant
old population in Sculptor, confirming an earlier claim of such a gradient (Da
Costa et al. 1996). Since we find no radial gradients of the age or metallicity
distribution within Sculptor, neither age nor metallicity can individually
account for the internal `second parameter' problem observed within the galaxy.
We have also identified an unusual `spur' of stars that extends from the main
sequence turnoff region and located between the canonical blue straggler region
and the subgiant branch. These stars are also more centrally concentrated than
the oldest stars in Sculptor, although not as extremely as the RHB stars.
Unable to convincingly interpret the spur either as an unusual young population
or as a foreground population of stars, we conclude that binary stars offer the
most reasonable explanation for the origin of the spur that is also consistent
with other features in the CMD of Sculptor. We infer that 30-60% of all
apparently single stars in the inner region of Sculptor may be binaries. We
speculate that the possible radial gradient in the binary-star population may
be related to the variation of the HB morphology in Sculptor.

scattering features. The spectrum is strongly pulse phase dependent and
absorption features are detected at virtually all phases. In particular, four
absorption-like features at 12.74 keV, 24.16 keV, 35.74 keV, and 49.5 keV are
observed in the descending edge of the main peak of the pulse profile. The
ratios between the centroid energies of the lines with respect to the first are
1:(1.9):(2.8):(3.9). These values are close to the harmonic relation expected
from cyclotron resonant scattering in a strong magnetic field, when
relativistic effects are taken into account. The equivalent widths of the
second, third, and fourth harmonics are found to be larger than that of the
first harmonic, confirming the key role of two-photon processes in the spectral
formation. These results provide the first evidence for {\it four harmonically

that GPS sources and CSOs are indeed the young counterparts of large, extended
sources. They are therefore the objects of choice to study the initial
evolution of extragalactic radio sources. Observational constraints on the
luminosity evolution of young radio sources have mainly come from number
density statistics and source size distributions, indicating that young sources
should decrease in luminosity by a factor ~10 as they evolve to extended
objects. We argue that the growth or decay in radio power of the individual
objects has a strong influence on the slope of their collective luminosity
function. This has led to a new method of constraining the evolution of young
sources by comparing their luminosity function to that of large extended
objects. The luminosity function of GPS sources is shown to be flatter than
that of extended objects. This is consistent with the proposed scenario that
young sources increase in radio luminosity and large size radio sources
decrease in luminosity with time, but larger homogeneous samples are needed.
The new large area radio surveys and the current sensitivity and flexibility of
VLBI networks allow the construction and investigation of such large and
homogeneous samples of young sources.

Both models give reasonable fits to the overall observed spectra; however,
neither is able to reproduce all the observed features. Some conspicuous
observed features are absent and some predicted features are unobserved. No
model that we have explored is able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed
infrared feature near 1 micron on April 15, 1994 (+7d), which has been
attributed to the triplet He I lambda 10830 transition. The low-mass
hydrodynamic model produces an infrared feature with a blend of He I, C I, O I,
and Si I--II lines, but it predicts a strong unobserved absorption feature near
6100 Angstroms due to Fe III, and the observed feature just blueward of 6000
Angstroms most likely due to Na D is not reproduced. The more massive model
does a better job of reproducing the observed infrared lineshape, but also
predicts the unobserved feature near 6100 Angstroms. The early-time spectrum of
the low-mass model is far too blue; thus, a more massive model may be slightly
favored. Since the predicted infrared feature is produced by a blend of so many
elements and there is no overwhelming evidence for other helium features such

time-delayed feedback is shown to be accessible to time series analysis of a
scalar variable only. The mapping of the original dynamics onto scalar
time-delay systems defined on sufficiently high dimensional spaces is
thoroughly discussed. The dimension of the ``embedding'' space turns out to be
independent of the delay time and thus of the dimensionality of the attractor
dynamics. As a consequence, the procedure described in the present paper turns
out to be definitely advantageous with respect to the standard ``embedding''
technique in the case of high-dimensional chaos, when the latter is practically
unapplicable. The mapping is not exact when delayed maps are used to reproduce
the dynamics of time-continuous systems, but the errors can be kept under
control. In this context, the approximation of delay-differential equations is
discussed with reference to different classes of maps. Appropriate tools to
estimate the a priori unknown delay time and the number of hidden components
are introduced. The generalized Mackey-Glass system is investigated in detail
as a testing ground for the theoretical considerations.

nonlocal effects will also generically modify the linear $H$ dependence of the

the ""static"" field with a fiducial abelian gauge-potential. The fiducial static
space-time and the gauge potential are universal, i.e., they are determined by
the geometry of the given physical space-time and do not depend on the spin of
the field. The reduction of the stationary axially symmetric problem to the
static one leads to a considerable simplification in the study of statistical
mechanics and we use it to draw a number of conclusions. First, we prove that
divergences of the entropy of scalar and spinor fields at the horizon in the
presence of rotation have the same form as in the static case and can be
removed by renormalization of the bare black hole entropy. Second, we

coming experiments are likely to be able to distinguish the two models. We find
that the reason for the two models giving opposite predictions is that the

distribution in the baryon (meson) in the two models are quite different. To
further investigate these models, we use the same parametrizations for the

the behavior of the meson-baryon fluctuation function. Also the two models

constrain the existing models and signal that the neutrinos are massive
Majorana particles. From the elementary particle point of view it pops up in
almost every model. In addition to the traditional mechanisms, like the
neutrino mass, the admixture of right handed currents etc, it may occur due to
the R-parity violating supersymmetric (SUSY) interactions. From the nuclear
physics point of view it is challenging, because: 1) The relevant nuclei have
complicated nuclear structure. 2) The energetically allowed transitions are
exhaust a small part of all the strength. 3) One must cope with the short
distance behavior of the transition operators, especially when the intermediate
particles are heavy (eg in SUSY models). Thus novel effects, like the double
beta decay of pions in flight between nucleons, have to be considered. 4) The
intermediate momenta involved are about 100 MeV. Thus one has to take into
account possible momentum dependent terms in the nucleon current. We find that,
for the mass mechanism, such modifications of the nucleon current for light
neutrinos reduce the nuclear matrix elements by about 25 per cent, almost
regardless of the nuclear model. In the case of heavy neutrinos the effect is
much larger and model dependent.

detail the minimal anomaly-mediated model parametrized by only 3+1 parameters:
M_aux, m_0, \tan\beta, and sign(\mu). The renormalization group equations
exhibit a novel ""focus point"" (as opposed to fixed point) behavior, which
allows squark and slepton masses to be far above their usual naturalness
bounds. We present the superparticle spectrum and highlight several
implications for high energy colliders. Three lightest supersymmetric particle
(LSP) candidates exist: the Wino, the stau, and the tau sneutrino. For the Wino
LSP scenario, light Wino triplets with the smallest possible mass splittings
are preferred; such Winos are within reach of Run II Tevatron searches.
Finally, we study a variety of sensitive low energy probes, including b -> s
gamma, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the electric dipole
moments of the electron and neutron.

spectrum below the string scale provides further evidence to the assertion that
the true string vacuum is connected to the Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold in the vicinity
of the free fermionic point in the Narain moduli space. An important property
of the Z_2 x Z_2 orbifold is the cyclic permutation symmetry between the three
twisted sectors. If preserved in the three generations models the cyclic
permutation symmetry results in a family universal anomalous U(1)_A, which is
instrumental in explaining squark degeneracy, provided that the dominant
component of supersymmetry breaking arises from the U(1)_A D-term.
Interestingly, the contribution of the family--universal D_A-term to the squark
masses may be intra-family non-universal, and may differ from the usual
(universal) boundary conditions assumed in the MSSM. We contemplate how
D_A--term spectroscopy may be instrumental in studying superstring models
irrespective of our ignorance of the details of supersymmetry breaking. We
examine the possible effect of the intra--family non--universality on the
resulting SUSY spectrum and the values of the strong coupling, effective weak
mixing angle and W-gauge boson mass, up to a two loop accuracy, in the two
models (universal and non-universal). We find that non universality relaxes the
constraint of color and charge breaking minima which appears in the universal
case. In addition, it predicts a 3% smaller value of \alpha_s due to different
threshold masses obtained in the latter scenario. Finally, we present the
experimentally allowed predictions of the two models in an M_0 and M_{1/2}

requires an initial value problem specifying an initial quantum state or
density matrix. Arbitrary specifications of the initial quantum state (pure or
mixed) results in initial time singularities which are not removed by the usual
renormalization counterterms. We study the initial time singularities in the
linearized equation of motion for the scalar condensate in a renormalizable
Yukawa theory in 3+1 dimensions. In this renormalizable theory the initial time
singularities are enhanced. We present a consistent method for removing these
initial time singularities by specifying initial states where the distribution
of high energy quanta is determined by the initial conditions and the
interaction effects. This is done through a Bogoliubov transformation which is
consistently obtained in a perturbative expansion.The usual renormalization
counterterms and the proper choice of the Bogoliubov coefficients lead to a
singularity free evolution equation. We establish the relationship between the
evolution equations in the linearized approximation and linear response theory.
It is found that only a very specific form of the external source for linear
response leads to a real time evolution equation which is singularity free. We
focus on the evolution of spatially inhomogeneous scalar condensates by
implementing the initial state preparation via a Bogoliubov transformation up
to one-loop. As a concrete application, the evolution equation for an
inhomogenous condensate is solved analytically and the results are carefully
analyzed. Symmetry breaking by initial quantum states is discussed.

In the past, it has been studied in detail in the large-N limit. In this paper
we study its small-N behavior at finite temperature in 2+1 dimensions. We show
that at small N the phase diagram of this model is {\it principally} different
from its behavior at $N\to \infty$. We show that for a small number $N$ of
fermions the model possesses two characteristic temperatures $T_{KT}$ and
$T^*$. That is, at small N, along with a quasiordered phase $0<T<T_{KT}$ the
system possesses a very large region of precursor fluctuations $T_{KT}<T<T^*$
which disappear only at a temperature $T^*$, substantially higher than the
temperature $T_{KT}$ of Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

however, have been more difficult to probe, although the elementary information

Recently, a low energy effective theory of monopoles was constructed and argued
to contain these dyons as quantum bound states. In this paper, we find these
dyonic bound states explicitly in the N=4 supersymmetric low energy effective
theory. After identifying the correct angular momentum operators, we motivate
an anti-self-dual ansatz for all BPS bound states. The wavefunctions are found
explicitly, whose spin contents and degeneracies match exactly the expected

$p$-shell the predictions of the calculations are in reasonable agreement with
most of the experimental results for these reactions. Woods-Saxon radial wave
functions are used, with their asymptotic forms matched to the experimental
separation energies for bound states, and matched to a binding energy of 0.01
MeV for unbound states. For comparison purposes, some results are given for
harmonic oscillator radial functions. Closest agreement between theory and
experiment is achieved with unrestricted shell-model configurations and
Woods-Saxon radial functions. We obtain for the neutrino-absorption inclusive
cross sections: $\bar{\sigma} = 13.8 \times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$ for the
$(\nu_{\mu},\mu^{-})$ decay-in-flight flux in agreement with the LSND datum of
$(12.4 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-40}$ cm$^2$; and $\bar{\sigma} = 12.5 \times
10^{-42}$ cm$^2$ for the $(\nu_{e},e^{-})$ decay-at-rest flux, less than the
experimental result of $(14.4 \pm 1.2) \times 10^{-42}$ cm$^2$.

potential, usually called the gravitational redshift, is described in the
literature essentially in two ways: on the one hand the phenomenon is explained
through the behaviour of clocks which run the faster the higher they are
located in the potential, whereas the energy and frequency of the propagating
photon do not change with height. The light thus appears to be redshifted
relative to the frequency of the clock. On the other hand the phenomenon is
alternatively discussed (even in some authoritative texts) in terms of an
energy loss of a photon as it overcomes the gravitational attraction of the
massive body. This second approach operates with notions such as the
""gravitational mass"" or the ""potential energy"" of a photon and we assert that
it is misleading. We do not claim to present any original ideas or to give a
comprehensive review of the subject, our goal being essentially a pedagogical
one.

in-situ measurements of the fiber light output were done. During several months
after irradiation all fibers were measured concerning light emission and
transparency.
  Fibers irradiated at high rates to about 1 Mrad are clearly damaged but
recover within a few hours up to several weeks. Using smaller rates up to the
same integral dose a decrease of the light output of scintillating fibers of up
to 30% can not be excluded. Clear fibers seem to be uneffected up to 400 krad.
No significant influence of fiber coverage and atmosphere during irradiation
was found.

formation. Specifically, we show that the tangle between A and B, plus the
tangle between A and C, cannot be greater than the tangle between A and the
pair BC. This inequality is as strong as it could be, in the sense that for any
values of the tangles satisfying the corresponding equality, one can find a
quantum state consistent with those values. Further exploration of this result
leads to a definition of the ""three-way tangle"" of the system, which is
invariant under permutations of the qubits.

measurement subtracts photons from the original entangled two-mode squeezed

performing a joint photon-number measurement on the reflected beams. In this
way the degree of entanglement of the shared state is increased and so is the
fidelity of the teleported state.
