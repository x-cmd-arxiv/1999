for the determination of the parameters of interacting galaxies. This method
has been applied to the HI distribution of NGC4449. In a first step the fast
restricted N-body models were used to confine a region in parameter space
reproducing the main observational features. In a second step a genetic
algorithm is introduced which allows for an automated search in parameter space
as well as for a uniqueness test of special parameter sets. Using artificial
data I show that the genetic algorithm reliably recovers orbital parameters. In
the third step the results of the restricted N-body models are compared with
detailed self-consistent N-body simulations. In the case of NGC4449 the
applicability of the simple restricted N-body calculations is demonstrated.
  NGC4449 is an active star-forming dwarf galaxy of Magellanic type. From radio
observations van Woerden et al. (1975) found an extended HI-halo around NGC4449
which is at least a factor of 10 larger than the optical diameter. More
recently, Bajaja et al. (1994) and Hunter et al. (1998) discerned details in
the HI-halo: a disc-like feature around the center of NGC4449 and a lopsided
arm structure. In a series of simulations it is demonstrated that the main
features can be obtained by a gravitational interaction between NGC4449 and
DDO125, another nearby dwarf galaxy. According to these calculations the
closest approach between both galaxies happened 350 Myr ago at a minimum
distance of 25 kpc on a nearly parabolic orbit. In case of the encounter
scenario, the dynamical mass of DDO125 should not be smaller than 10% of
NGC4449's mass. The origin of this disc is still unclear, but it might be
caused by a previous interaction.

  dielectrics","10 Pages, RevTex, 8 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  The distribution function of relaxation times in disordered dielectrics has
been calculated in the random field theory framework. For this purpose, we
first consider the dynamics of single two-orientable impurity electric dipole
in a random electric field $E$ created by the rest of impurities in disordered
ferroelectric. This dynamics is conveniently described by Langevin equation.
Relaxation time $\tau $ is then a reciprocal probability (calculated on the
base of Fokker-Planck equation) of the dipole transition through barrier in a
double-well potential (corresponding to two possible dipole orientations),
distorted by a random fields. The obtained dependence $\tau (E)$ made it
possible to obtain the expression for relaxation times distribution function
$F(\tau)$(via random fields distribution function $f(E)$. Latter function has
been calculated self-consistently in the random field theory framework.
Nonlinear random field contribution and effects of spatial correlations between
impurities have also been taken into account. It was shown that nonlinear
contribution of random field gives asymmetric shape of $F(\tau)$, while in
linear case it is symmetric. Comparison of calculated $F(\tau)$ curves with
those extracted from empirical Cole-Cole (CC), Davidson-Cole (DC),
Kohlrausch-William-Watts (KWW) and Havriliak-Negami (HN) functions had shown,
that they correspond to mixed ferro-glass phase with coexistence of short and
long-range order. Different forms of $F(\tau)$ are determined by linear (CC) or
nonlinear (DC, KWW, HN) contributions of random field.

surface of Bi-2212 single crystals. The number of junctions in a stack was
tailored by progressively increasing the height of the stack by ion-beam
etching, while its tunneling characteristics were measured in-situ in a vacuum
chamber for temperatures down to ~13 K. Using this in-situ etching/measurements
technique in a single piece of crystal, we systematically excluded any spurious
effects arising from variations in the junction parameters and made clear
analysis on the following properties of the surface and inner conducting
planes. First, the tunneling resistance and the current-voltage curves are
scaled by the surface junction resistance. Second, we confirm that the
reduction in both the gap and the superconducting transition temperature of the
surface conducting plane in contact with a normal metal is not caused by the
variation in the doping level, but is caused by the proximity contact. Finally,
the main feature of a junction is not affected by the presence of other
junctions in a stack in a low bias region.
