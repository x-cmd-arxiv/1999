stellar crust. We follow the magneto-rotational evolution within a simple
recycling scenario, including the possibility of magnetospheric propeller.
  We find the presence of a tail in the period distribution of the synthetic
populations at periods shorter than 1.558 ms, the minimum detected so far. For
the soft EoS the recycling gives rise to a spin distribution which is
increasing monotonically toward short periods and a clear ``barrier'' forms at
the minimum period for the onset of mass shedding. For the stiff EoS the
distribution is flatter displaying a broad maximum about 2-4 ms.
  The estimated fraction of neutron stars spinning close to their shedding
limit over the millisecond pulsar population is found to be significant.
Crustal magnetic field decay models predict the existence of massive (M>1.4

strong absorption shortward of 1650 A, with specific spectroscopic features.
Such a cutoff in the emission from GRB 980329 may already have been observed by
Fruchter et al.; if so, GRB 980329 was at redshift 3.0 < z < 4.4 . BVRI
photometry of GRB 990510 could also be explained by H2 absorption if GRB 990510
is at redshift 1.6 < z < 2.3. The fluorescence accompanying the UV pumping of
the H2 will result in UV emission from the GRB which can extend over days or
months, depending on parameters of the ambient medium and beaming of the GRB
flash. The 7.5-13.6 eV fluorescent luminosity is \sim 10^{41.7} erg/s for

interpret these radio knots as extremely young, ultra-dense HII regions. We
model their luminosities and spectral energy distributions, finding that they
are consistent with unusually dense HII regions having electron densities, 1500
cm^-3 < n_e < 5000 cm^-3, and sizes of 3-8 pc. Since these H II regions are not
visible in optical images, we propose that the radio data preferentially reveal
the youngest, densest, and most highly obscured starforming events. Energy
considerations imply that each of the five \HII regions contains ~750 O7V
equivalent stars, greater than the number found in 30 Doradus in the LMC. The
high densities imply an over-pressure compared to the typical interstellar
medium so that such objects must be short-lived (<0.5 Myr expansion
timescales). We conclude that the radio continuum maps reveal the very young
(<0.5 Myr) precursors of ``super starclusters'' or ``proto globular clusters''
which are prominent at optical and UV wavelengths in He 2-10. If the
ultra-dense HII regions are typical of those which we predict will be found in
other starbursting systems, then super starclusters spend 15% of their lifetime
in heavily-obscured environments, similar to Galactic ultra-compact HII
regions. This body of work leads us to propose that massive extragalactic star
clusters (i.e. proto globular clusters) with ages <10^6 yr may be most easily
identified by finding compact radio sources with optically-thick thermal
bremsstrahlung spectral signatures.

have been regular over this time. The 530d period and its 1.5 - 2 magnitude

binary system (as also suspected from the structure of the circumstellar

dust orbiting with the companion. The properties of the envelope found from
molecular line observations: the fast molecular wind, the relatively small size
of the dense circumstellar envelope, and the high mass loss rate, all suggest
that V Hya has entered its `superwind' phase. However, its spectral type,
period, colors, and lack of ionizing radiation show that the star is still on
the AGB. These properties add to the evidence that the complex structures of
many planetary planetary nebulae, including fast stellar winds, originate
during the final phases of mass loss on the AGB.

the recent realizations of D-branes as tachyonic solitons, coming from bound
states of higher dimensional systems of unstable branes, are described. It is
shown how the K-theory formalism naturally reproduces the known spectra of BPS
and non-BPS D-branes, and how it can be systematically used to predict the
existence of new states. The emphasis is placed on the new interpretations of
D-branes as conventional topological solitons in other brane worldvolumes, how
the mathematical formalism can be used to deduce the gauge field content on
both supersymmetric and non-BPS branes, and also how K-theory predicts new
relationships between the various superstring theories and their D-brane
spectra. The implementations of duality symmetries as natural isomorphisms of
K-groups are discussed. The relationship with the standard cohomological

also briefly described.

harmonic oscillator that describes a one-mode bosonic field. We connect the
quantum measurement of an observable of the field with the possibility of
amplifying the observable ideally through a quantum amplifier. The
``classical'' measurement corresponds to the joint measurement of the position
$q$ and momentum $p$ of the harmonic oscillator, with following evaluation of a
function $f$ of the outcome $\alpha=q+ip$. For the electromagnetic field the
joint measurement is achieved by a heterodyne detector. The quantum measurement
of an observable $\hat O$ is obtained by preamplifying the heterodyne detector
through an ideal amplifier of $\hat O$, and rescaling the outcome by the gain
$g$. We give a general criterion which states when this preamplified heterodyne
detection scheme approaches the ideal quantum measurement of $\hat O$ in the
limit of infinite gain. We show that this criterion is satisfied and the ideal
measurement is achieved for the case of the photon number operator and for the
quadrature. For both operators the method is robust to nonunit quantum
efficiency of the heterodyne detector. On the other hand, we show that the
preamplified heterodyne detection scheme does not work for arbitrary observable
of the field. As a counterexample, we prove that the simple quadratic function
of the field $\hat K=i(a^{\dag 2}-a^2)/2$ has no corresponding polynomial
function $f(\alpha,\bar \alpha)$---including the obvious choice
$f=\hbox{Im}(\alpha^2)$---that allows the measurement of $\hat K$ through the
preamplified heterodyne measurement scheme.

result is, however, more generally applicable including to equations in higher
