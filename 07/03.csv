  http://www.santafe.edu/projects/evca/med.ps.gz",,,"Santa Fe Institute Working Paper 99-07-041","adap-org nlin.AO q-bio.PE",,"  We analytically study the dynamics of evolving populations that exhibit
metastability on the level of phenotype or fitness. In constant selective
environments, such metastable behavior is caused by two qualitatively different
mechanisms. One the one hand, populations may become pinned at a local fitness
optimum, being separated from higher-fitness genotypes by a {\em fitness
barrier} of low-fitness genotypes. On the other hand, the population may only
be metastable on the level of phenotype or fitness while, at the same time,
diffusing over {\em neutral networks} of selectively neutral genotypes.
Metastability occurs in this case because the population is separated from
higher-fitness genotypes by an {\em entropy barrier}: The population must
explore large portions of these neutral networks before it discovers a rare
connection to fitter phenotypes.
  We derive analytical expressions for the barrier crossing times in both the
fitness barrier and entropy barrier regime. In contrast with ``landscape''
evolutionary models, we show that the waiting times to reach higher fitness
depend strongly on the width of a fitness barrier and much less on its height.
The analysis further shows that crossing entropy barriers is faster by orders
of magnitude than fitness barrier crossing. Thus, when populations are trapped
in a metastable phenotypic state, they are most likely to escape by crossing an
entropy barrier, along a neutral path in genotype space. If no such escape
route along a neutral path exists, a population is most likely to cross a
fitness barrier where the barrier is {\em narrowest}, rather than where the
barrier is shallowest.

the H-alpha and mid/far-IR luminosity of the galaxies are becoming increasingly
available, effectively complementing the restframe UV data; they offer a better
handle on the amount of dust obscuration present in the galaxies, although some
ambiguity remains as to the distribution of the dust within the system and the
opacity correction factor this implies. At higher redshifts, most of the
available data cover the far-UV region only, representing a challenge for a
careful assessment of the effects of dust in galaxies. Finally, I discuss the

universe with Omega_Lambda=0 and the presence of > 0.1 micron dust grains with
a mass density of Omega_dust ~ (few) * 10^{-5} in the intergalactic (IG)
medium. The same dust that dims the SNe absorbs the cosmic UV/optical
background radiation around ~ 1 micron, and re-emits it at far infrared (FIR)
wavelengths. Here we compare the FIR emission from IG dust with observations of
the cosmic microwave (CMB) and cosmic far infrared backgrounds (FIRB) by the
DIRBE/FIRAS instruments. We find that the emission would not lead to measurable
distortion to the CMB, but would represent a substantial fraction (> 75%) of
the measured value of the FIRB in the 300-1000 micron range. This contribution
would be marginally consistent with the present unresolved fraction of the
observed FIRB in an open universe. However, we find that IG dust probably could
not reconcile the standard Omega=1 CDM model with the SN observations, even if
the necessary quantity of dust existed. Future observations able to reliably
resolve the FIRB to a flux limit of ~0.5 mJy, along with a more precise measure
of the coarse-grained FIRB, will provide a definitive test of the IG dust
hypothesis in all cosmologies.

based on belief propagation or message passing. We estimate the probability
that there exist no simple cycles of length less than or equal to k at a
randomly chosen node in a turbo decoding graph using a combination of counting
arguments and independence assumptions. For large block lengths n, this
probability is approximately e^{-{2^{k-1}-4}/n}, k>=4. Simulation results
validate the accuracy of the various approximations. For example, for turbo
codes with a block length of 64000, a randomly chosen node has a less than 1%

examine the essential self-adjointness of the time translation operator in the

singularity becomes regular if probed with waves while stronger classical
singularities remain singular. If the spacetime is regular when probed with
waves we may say that the spacetime is `globally hyperbolic.'

performed in the H1 experiment at HERA using 1994 to 1997 data corresponding to
an integrated luminosity of 37pb^-1. First generation leptoquarks (LQs) are
searched in very high Q^2 neutral (NC) and charged (CC) current data samples.
The measurements are compared to Standard Model (SM) expectations from
deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). A deviation in the Q^2 spectrum previously
observed in the 1994 to 1996 dataset at Q^2 \gsim 15000GeV^2 remains, though
with less significance. This deviation corresponded to a clustering in the
invariant mass spectrum at M \simeq 200 GeV which is not observed with the 1997
dataset alone. The NC DIS data is used to constrain the Yukawa couplings lambda
of first generation scalar and vector LQs in the Buchmueller-Rueckl-Wyler
effective model. Scalar LQs are excluded for masses up to 275GeV for a coupling
of electromagnetic strength, lambda=0.3. A sensitivity to coupling values \lsim
1 is established for masses up to 400GeV for any LQ type. The NC and CC DIS
data are combined to constrain lambda for arbitrary branching ratios of the LQ
into eq in a generic model. For a decay branching ratio into e^+ u pairs as
small as 10%, LQ masses up to 260 GeV are ruled out for lambda=0.3. LQs
possessing couplings to mixed fermion generations, which could lead to signals
of lepton flavor violation (LFV), are searched in events with a high transverse
momentum mu or tau. No mu+X or tau+X event candidate is found that is
compatible with LQ kinematics. Constraints are set on the Yukawa coupling
involving the mu and tau lepton in a yet unexplored mass range.

relaxed. The bound on $m_{H^{\pm}}$ in the MSSM--BRpV model is $\gsim 200-250$
GeV for the the heavy squark limit. For lighter squarks, light charged Higgs
bosons can be reconciled with $B(b \to s\gamma)$ only if there is also a light
chargino. In the BRpV model if we impose $m_{\chi^{\pm}_1}>90$ GeV $m_{H^{\pm}}
\gsim 75$ GeV, around 30 GeV down from the MSSM. In this case the charged Higgs
bosons would be observable at LEP II. The relaxation of the bounds is due
mainly to the fact that charged Higgs bosons mix with staus and they contribute
importantly to $B(b \to s\gamma)$.

spatial scale of less than 100 km) the correlation between the time series is
very strong, and that using windowing techniques a reliable correlation delay
time series can be produced for each pair of sites (10 such pairs are
available). We use this delay time series together with a frozen flow model to
estimate the velocity of a passing front, and compare the results to
meteorological data and Numerical Weather Prediction output, showing good
agreement. In the second approach, the data is analyzed using Empirical
Orthogonal Functions. We demonstrate that the temporally demeaned and
normalized analysis yields information about the passing of fronts, while the
spatially demeaned data yields orographic information. A common second mode
highlights the underlying wave behavior.

interaction Hamiltonian of the two-qubit system which would correspond to the
CNOT transformation; the analysis naturally generalizes to the Toffoli gate.
Despite nonuniqueness of the model of the interaction Hamiltonian, the analysis
distinguishes that the interaction Hamiltonian does not posses any global
(rotational) symmetry. This forces us to conclude that the direct
(non-mediated) interaction in the two-qubit system does not suffice for
implementing the CNOT gate. I.e., so as to be able succesfully to implement the
CNOT transformation, a mediator (i.e. an external physical system interacting
with both of the qubits) is required.
