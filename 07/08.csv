spherical halo is studied using both the Theory of Linear Response for
dynamical friction and N-Body simulations. The analytical approach includes the
effects of the gravitational wake, of the tidal deformation and the shift of
the barycenter of the primary, so unifying the local versus global
interpretation of dynamical friction. Sizes, masses, orbital energies and
eccentricities are chosen as expected in hierarchical clustering models. We
find that in general the drag force in self-gravitating backgrounds is weaker
than in uniform media and that the orbital decay is not accompanied by a
significant circularization. We also show that the dynamical friction time
scale is weakly dependent on the initial circularity. We provide a fitting
formula for the decay time that includes the effect of mass and angular
momentum loss. Live satellites with dense cores can survive disruption up to an
Hubble time within the primary, notwithstanding the initial choice of orbital
parameters. Dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way, like Sagittarius A
and Fornax, have already suffered mass stripping and, with their present
masses, the sinking times exceed 10 Gyr even if they are on very eccentric
orbits.

analytical model for galaxy formation; for the first time a joint comparison
with galaxy and QSO observables is performed. In this model it is assumed that
the same physical variable which determines galaxy morphology is able to
modulate the mass of the black hole responsible for QSO activity. Both halo
spin and the occurence of a major merger are considered as candidates to this
role. The predictions of the model are compared to available data for the
type-dependent galaxy mass functions, the star-formation history of elliptical
galaxies, the QSO luminosity function and its evolution (including the obscured
objects contributing to the hard-X-ray background), the mass function of
dormant black holes and the distribution of black-hole -- bulge mass ratios. A
good agreement with observations is obtained if the halo spin modulates the
efficiency of black-hole formation, and if the galactic halos at $z=0$ have
shone in an inverted order with respect to the hierarchical one (i.e., stars
and black holes in bigger galactic halos have formed before those in smaller
ones). This inversion of hierarchical order for galaxy formation, which
reconciles galaxy formation with QSO evolution, is consistent with many pieces
of observational evidence.

after its 1995-1996 decline is discussed. All of the components reported from
earlier declines are seen. This novel dataset provides new information on these
components including several aspects not previously seen in declines of RCrB
and other RCBs. In the latter category is the discovery that the decline's
onset is marked by distortions of absorption lines of high-excitation lines,
and quickly followed by emission in these and in low excitation lines. This
'photospheric trigger' implies that dust causing the decline is formed close to
the star. These emission lines fade quickly. After 1995 November 2, low
excitation narrow (FWHM ~12 km s-1) emission lines remain. These appear to be a
permanent feature, slightly blue-shifted from the systemic velocity, and
unaffected by the decline except for a late and slight decrease of flux at
minimum light. The location of the warm, dense gas providing these lines is
uncertain. Absorption lines unaffected by overlying sharp emission are greatly
broadened, weakened, and red-shifted at the faintest magnitudes when scattered
light from the star is a greater contributor than direct light transmitted
through the fresh soot cloud. A few broad lines are seen at and near minimum
light with approxiamately constant flux: prominent among these are the He I
triplet series, Na I D, and [N II] lines. These lines are blue-shifted by about
30 km s(-1) relative to the systemic velocity with no change in velocity over
the several months for whicht he lines were seen. It is suggested that these
lines, especially the He I lines, arise from an accretion disk around an unseen
compact companion, which may be a low-mass white dwarf. If so, R CrB is similar
to the unusual post-AGB star 89 Her.

on where the PSF center falls within a pixel. Such intra-pixel sensitivity
variations will not be corrected by flat field calibration and may limit the
accuracy of stellar photometry conducted with undersampled images, as are
typical for Hubble Space Telescope observations. The total flux in a stellar
image can vary by up to 0.03 mag in F555W WFC images depending on how it is
sampled, for example. For NIC3, these variations are especially strong, up to
0.39 mag, strongly limiting its use for stellar photometry. Intra-pixel
sensitivity variations can be corrected for, however, by constructing a
well-sampled PSF from a dithered data set. The reconstructed PSF is the
convolution of the optical PSF with the pixel response. It can be evaluated at
any desired fractional pixel location to generate a table of photometric
corrections as a function of relative PSF centroid. A caveat is that the
centroid of an undersampled PSF can also be affected by the pixel response
function, thus sophisticated centroiding methods, such as cross-correlating the
observed PSF with its fully-sampled counterpart, are required to derive the
proper photometric correction.

quasars, and stars emerged into their present form. We considered
high-throughput UV spectroscopy (10-50x throughput of HST/COS) and wide-field
optical imaging (at least 10 arcmin square). The exciting science to be
addressed in the post-HST era includes studies of dark matter and baryons, the
origin and evolution of the elements, and the major construction phase of
galaxies and quasars. Key unanswered questions include: Where is the rest of
the unseen universe? What is the interplay of the dark and luminous universe?
How did the IGM collapse to form the galaxies and clusters? When were galaxies,
clusters, and stellar populations assembled into their current form? What is
the history of star formation and chemical evolution? Are massive black holes a
natural part of most galaxies? A large-aperture UV/O telescope in space
(ST-2010) will provide a major facility in the 21st century for solving these
scientific problems. The UVOWG recommends that the first mission be a 4m
aperture, SIRTF-class mission that focuses on UV spectroscopy and wide-field
imaging. In the coming decade, NASA should investigate the feasibility of an 8m
telescope, by 2010, with deployable optics similar to NGST. No high-throughput
UV/Optical mission will be possible without significant NASA investments in
technology, including UV detectors, gratings, mirrors, and imagers.

for a dispersion in metallicity of 0.35+/-0.10 dex based on the scatter in the

Although existing observations of Local Group dwarf galaxies indicate that
their mean stellar metallicity depends rather sensitively on host galaxy

explosive nucleosynthesis and the matter mixing in a jet-like explosion are

is shown that the jet-like explosion model is favored because the radioactive
nuclei 44Ti is produced in a sufficient amount to explain the observed
bolometric luminosity at 3600 days after the explosion. It is also shown that
the observed line profiles of Fe[II] are well reproduced by the jet-like
explosion model. In particular, the fast moving component travelling at
(3000-4000) km/s is well reproduced, which has not been reproduced by the
spherical explosion models. Moreover, we conclude that the favored degree of a
jet-like explosion to explain the tail of the light curve is consistent with
the one favored in the calculation of the matter mixing. The concluded ratio of
the velocity along to the polar axis relative to that in the equatorial plane
at the Si/Fe interface is about 2:1. This conclusion will give good constraints
on the calculations of the dynamics of the collapse-driven supernova. The
asymmetry of the observed line profiles of Fe[II] can be explained when the
assumption of the equatorial symmetry of the system is removed, which can be
caused by the asymmetry of the jet-like explosion with respect to the
equatorial plane. In the case of SN 1987A, the jet on the north pole has to be
stronger than that on the south pole in order to reproduce the observed
asymmetric line profiles. Such an asymmetry may also be the origin of the
pulsar kick. When we believe some theories that cause such an asymmetric

close-packed crystal as a special limit, which represents an extreme testing
ground for the quality of such liquid-state based theories. We therefore study
the predictions of DFT for the structure and thermodynamics of the hard-sphere
crystal in this limit. We examine the Ramakrishnan-Yussouff (RY) approximation
and two variants of the fundamental-measure theory (FMT) developed by Rosenfeld
and coworkers. We allow for general shapes of the density peaks, going beyond
the common Gaussian approximation. In all cases we find that, upon approaching
close packing, the peak width vanishes proportionally to the free distance a
between the particles and the free energy depends logarithmically on a.
However, different peak shapes and next-to-leading contributions to the free
energy result from the different approximate functionals. For the RY theory,
within the Gaussian approximation, we establish that the crystalline solutions
form a closed loop with a stable and an unstable branch both connected to the
close-packing point at a=0, consistent with the absence of a liquid-solid
spinodal. That version of FMT that has previously been applied to freezing,
predicts asymptotically step-like density profiles confined to the cells of
self-consistent cell theory. But a recently suggested improved version which
employs tensor weighted densities yields wider and almost Gaussian peaks which
are shown to be in very good agreement with computer simulations.

evolution of black hole formation from the wave function by defining the
Hamilton-Jacobi characteristic function as $W = \hbar {\rm Im} \ln \psi$. We
find that the quantum corrected apparent horizon deviates from the classical
value only slightly without any qualitative change even in the critical case.

compactifications with vanishing cosmological constant, at least for low
orders, based on asymmetric orbifolds. A generic feature of these models is
that supersymmetry remains unbroken on the branes at all mass level, while it
is broken in the bulk in a way that preserves Fermi-Bose degeneracy at each

Cellular Automata (CA) theory, which is the most massively parallel computer
model currently known to science. We maintain that at the tiniest distance and
time scales the universe is completely deterministic, and utterly simple. Our
universe is a Cellular Automaton consisting of a huge array of cells capable of
storing numeric information. These cells form a vast, 3D 'geometric' CA, where
each cell has 26 surrounding neighboring cells that influence the state of a
given cell. CA theory directly implies that all the laws of physics must result
from interactions that are strictly local, therefore forbidding any form of
action at a distance. CA theory suggests that space, time, matter, energy, and
motion are all the same thing: the end result of information changing state in
the CA. The CA model automatically contains an inherent maximum speed limit for
which information can be moved from place to place.We propose that light
(photon) motion is the fixed, simple shifting of a photon information pattern
from cell to adjacent cell at every 'clock cycle'. Thus photons 'travel' only
at one fixed speed, which is unaffected by any possible source motion. By
adopting absolute CA space and time coordinates for the description of a pair
of observers in inertial reference frames with a relative velocity 'v', then
the Lorentz transformation follows mathematically. We explore the ramifications
of this CA model for all of physics.

inappropriate here and should be replaced by the word 'hypothetical'. Mermin's
choice imposes a strictly contextual meaning based upon an interpretation of
counterfactuality which he used to refute, without proof as we shall see,
Stapp's logical proof [3] of non-locality in quantum theory. In linguistic
theory both authors' choices of meaning: counterfactual versus hypothetical are
equally acceptable and therefore some of the issues they discussed lie outside
the domain of physics. The issues they discussed are further confused by the
fact that in his reply Stapp [2] seems to have adopted Mermin's counterfactual
interpretation against his own original [3] hypothetical interpretation. In the

statements but we modify his crucial statement LOC2 appropriately, then

of noncontextuality and is \emph{incompatible} with statistical predictions of
quantum mechanics. Thus noncontextual models can be empirically falsified,
\emph{independent} of locality condition. For this an appropriate entanglement
between \emph{disjoint} Hilbert spaces pertaining to translational and spin
degrees of freedom of a single spin-1/2 particle is invoked

hyperelliptic curves of infinite genus. In particular, we explore the extent to
which the classical Burchnall-Chaundy theory generalizes in the infinite genus
limit, and systematically study the effect of Darboux transformations for the
KdV hierarchy on such infinite genus curves. Our approach applies to
complex-valued periodic solutions of the KdV hierarchy and naturally identifies
the Riemann surface familiar from standard Floquet theoretic considerations
with a limit of Burchnall-Chaundy curves.

McGuire-Yang-Baxter equation in such a way that the spectral parameters do not
possess the difference property. A discussion of the derivation of the
supersymmetric U model is given in this context such that applied chemical
potential and magnetic field terms can be coupled arbitrarily. As a limiting
case the Bariev model is obtained.

  equation",,,"10.1088/0266-5611/16/1/306",,"solv-int nlin.SI",,"  A new (scalar) spectral decomposition is found for the Dirac system in two
dimensions associated to the focusing Davey--Stewartson II (DSII) equation.
Discrete spectrum in the spectral problem corresponds to eigenvalues embedded
into a two-dimensional essential spectrum. We show that these embedded
eigenvalues are structurally unstable under small variations of the initial
data. This instability leads to the decay of localized initial data into
continuous wave packets prescribed by the nonlinear dynamics of the DSII
equation.
