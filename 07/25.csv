dynamics in a slab geometry. We find that the atom-density profile presents a
pronounced layering, similar to those observed in low-temperature liquid metals
like Ga and Hg. The depth-dependent pair correlation function shows that the
effect originates from directional bonding of Si atoms at the surface, and
propagates into the bulk. The layering has no major effects in the electronic
and dynamical properties of the system, that are very similar to those of bulk
liquid Si. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a liquid surface by
first-principles molecular dynamics.

  relation to experiments become clearer",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Icicles with wave patterns on their surfaces can sometimes be seen hanging
from roofs of buildings. Surprisingly, most of these wave patterns are at
intervals of about 1 cm. The reason for this uniformity of interval has not
been clarified. Here we show a formula to explain this remarkable phenomenon by
introducing a new instability theory. This theory is given by thermal diffusion
in thin water layer streams flowing along the icicles. The streams change the
temperature distribution and control waves of short wavelengths. The specific
wavelength (about 1 cm) can be determined by Laplace instability of the heat
field in the atmosphere and by the thermal diffusion effect in thin-layer
streams.

on the observation that the quantum character of matter becomes more
significant as one gets closer to the big bang. As the metric loses its
meaning, it makes sense to consider Schrodinger's three generic types of
manifolds - unconnected differentiable, affinely connected, and metrically
connected - as a temporal sequence following the big bang. Hence one should
quantize the gravitational field on general differentiable manifolds or on
affinely connected manifolds. The SL(2,C) gauge theory of gravitation is
employed to explore this possibility. Within this framework, the quantization
itself may well be canonical.

of deformation quantization for any Poisson manifold. Kontsevich's formula has
been reinterpreted physically as quantum correlation functions of a topological
sigma model for open strings as well as in the context of D-branes in flat
backgrounds with a Neveu-Schwarz B-field. Here the corresponding Kontsevich's
formula for the dual of a Lie algebra is derived in terms of the formalism of
D-branes on group manifolds. In particular we show that that formula is encoded
at the two-point correlation functions of the Wess-Zumino-Witten effective
theory with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The B-field entering in the
formalism plays an important role in this derivation.

accompanied by shifts on momentum or winding lattice states. The models contain
variable numbers of D5 branes, whose massless (and, at times, even massive)
modes have variable numbers of supersymmetries. We display new type-I models
with partial supersymmetry breaking N=2 \to N=1, N=4 \to N=1 and N=4 \to N=2.
The geometry of these models is rather rich: the shift operations create brane
multiplets related by orbifold transformations that support gauge groups of
reduced rank. Some of the models are deformations of six-dimensional
supersymmetric type-I models, while others have dual M-theory descriptions.
