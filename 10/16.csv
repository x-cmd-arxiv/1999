produced in the case of isotropic incident radiation, P(nu -> nu'). The former

of X-ray and low-frequency lines upon scattering in hot, optically thin
plasmas, such as present in clusters of galaxies, in the coronae of accretion
disks in X-ray binaries and AGNs, during supernova explosions, etc. Both
formulae can also be employed as the kernels of the corresponding integral
kinetic equations (direction-dependent and isotropic) in the general problem of
Comptonization on thermal electrons. The K(nu,Omega -> nu',Omega') kernel, in
particular, is applicable to the problem of induced Compton interaction of
anisotropic low-frequency radiation of high brightness temperature with free
electrons in the vicinity of powerful radiosources and masers.
Fokker-Planck-type expansion (up to fourth order) of the integral kinetic
equation with the P(nu -> nu') kernel derived here leads to a generalization of

offset pointing provides an accurate background template for the cluster

point-to-point subtraction of the {\it in situ} background from the cluster
field, with appropriate propagation of errors. The resulting cluster radial

substantially lower than those of unlensed ones and also provide an independent
means of estimating the contribution of faint quasars to the hard X-ray
component of the cosmic X-ray background. Our spectral analysis indicate a
flattening of the spectral index in the hard band (4-20keV restframe) for 2
radio-loud quasars in the GL quasar sample for which the data have moderate
signal-to-noise ratio. We have identified a large fraction of Broad Absorption
Line (BAL) quasars amongst the GL quasar population. We find that approximately
35% of radio-quiet GL quasars contain BAL features which is significantly
larger than the 10% fraction of BAL quasars presently found in optically
selected flux limited quasar samples. We present a simple model that estimates
the effects of attenuation and lens magnification on the luminosity function of
quasars and that explains the observed fraction of GL BAL quasars. These
observations suggest that a large fraction of BAL quasars are missed from flux
limited optical surveys. Modeling of several X-ray observations of the GL BAL
quasar PG1115+080 suggests that the observed large X-ray variability may be
caused in part by a variable intrinsic absorber consistent with previously
observed variability of the BAL troughs in the UV band. The observed large
X-ray flux variations in PG1115+080 offer the prospect of considerably reducing
errors in determining the time delay with future X-ray monitoring of this

phases of strongly correlated electrons which support excitations with
fractional quantum numbers. Starting with a class of microscopic models
believed to capture much of the essential physics of the cuprate
superconductors, we derive a new gauge theory - based upon a {\it discrete}
Ising or Z_2 symmetry - which interpolates naturally between an
antiferromagnetic Mott insulator and a conventional d-wave superconductor. We
explore the intervening regime, and demonstrate the possible existence of an
exotic fractionalized insulator - the nodal liquid - as well as various more
conventional insulating phases exhibiting broken lattice symmetries. A crucial
role is played by vortex configurations in the Z_2 gauge field.
Fractionalization is obtained if they are uncondensed. Within the insulating
phases, the dynamics of these Z_2 vortices in two dimensions (2d) is described,
after a duality transformation, by an Ising model in a transverse field - the
Ising spins representing the Z_2 vortices. The presence of an unusual Berry's
phase term in the gauge theory, leads to a doping-dependent ""frustration"" in
the dual Ising model, being fully frustrated at half-filling. The Z_2 gauge
theory is readily generalized to a variety of different situations - in
particular, it can also describe 3d insulators with fractional quantum numbers.
We point out that the mechanism of fractionalization for d>1 is distinct from
the well-known 1d spin-charge separation. Other interesting results include a
description of an exotic fractionalized superconductor in two or higher
dimensions.

convenient point of departure for studying translational symmetry breaking in
doped antiferromagnets: these results are briefly reviewed here with an
emphasis on experimental implications. In the presence of stronger frustration,
it was also argued that the insulating antiferromagnet can undergo a transition

distinct sets of q-Hermite polynomials, one for q<1 and the other for q>1. It
turns out that these correspond to two distinct regimes: the previously studied
case of forward bias (q<1) and the regime of reverse bias (q>1) where the
boundaries support a current opposite in direction to the bulk bias. For the
forward bias case we confirm the previously proposed phase diagram whereas the

by an $S$-shape density profile, such that particles density from one side of
the origin (sites $X \leq 0$) is larger (high density phase, HDP) than that
from the other side (low-density phase, LDP). We suppose that all the lattice
gas particles, except for the rightmost particle of the HDP, have symmetric
hopping probabilities. The rightmost particle of the HDP, which determines the
position of the phase separating boundary, is subject to a constant force $F$,
oriented towards the HDP; in our model this force mimics an effective tension
of the phase separating boundary. We find that, in the general case, the mean
displacement $\bar{X(t)}$ of the phase boundary grows with time as $\bar{X(t)}
= \alpha(F) t^{1/2}$, where the prefactor $\alpha(F)$ depends on $F$ and on the
initial densities in the HDP and LDP. We show that $\alpha(F)$ can be positive
or negative, which means that depending on the physical conditions the HDP may
expand or get compressed. In the particular case when $\alpha(F) = 0$, i.e.
when the HDP and LDP coexist with each other, the second moment of the phase
boundary displacement is shown to grow with time sublinearly, $\bar{X^2(t)} =
\gamma t^{1/2}$, where the prefactor $\gamma$ is also calculated explicitly.
Our analytical predictions are shown to be in a very good agreement with the

energy barriers along stable uphill directions, while mechanism B consists in
finding unstable downhill directions out of a saddle. Depending on the mutual

  In our paper, we show that the spectral representation for isotropic
two-component composites also applies to uniaxial polycrystals. We have learned

derivation is more detailed, our result for the spectral function is the same
as Milton's. We very much regret not having been aware of this work at the time

  Original abstract:
  We extend the spectral theory used for the calculation of the effective
linear response functions of composites to the case of a polycrystalline
material with uniaxially anisotropic microscopic symmetry. As an application,
we combine these results with a nonlinear decoupling approximation as modified
by Ma et al., to calculate the third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility of
a uniaxial polycrystal, assuming that the effective dielectric function of the
polycrystal can be calculated within the effective-medium approximation.

  proceedings ""Stochastic Dynamics and Pattern Formation in Biological Systems""",,"10.1063/1.59954",,"cond-mat.soft q-bio",,"  The number of protein structures is far less than the number of sequences. By
imposing simple generic features of proteins (low energy and compaction) on all
possible sequences we show that the structure space is sparse compared to the
sequence space. Even though the sequence space grows exponentially with N (the
number of amino acids) we conjecture that the number of low energy compact
structures only scales as ln N. This implies that many sequences must map onto
countable number of basins in the structure space. The number of sequences for
which a given fold emerges as a native structure is further reduced by the dual
requirements of stability and kinetic accessibility. The factor that determines
the dual requirement is related to the sequence dependent temperatures,
T_\theta (collapse transition temperature) and T_F (folding transition
temperature). Sequences, for which \sigma =(T_\theta-T_F)/T_\theta is small,
typically fold fast by generically collapsing to the native-like structures and
then rapidly assembling to the native state. Such sequences satisfy the dual
requirements over a wide temperature range. We also suggest that the functional
requirement may further reduce the number of sequences that are biologically
competent. The scheme developed here for thinning of the sequence space that
leads to foldable structures arises naturally using simple physical
characteristics of proteins. The reduction in sequence space leading to the
emergence of foldable structures is demonstrated using lattice models of
proteins.

source composed of matter confined to compact regions and gravitational
non-linearities extending to infinity. The new method is free of divergences or
undefined integrals, correctly predicts all gravitational wave ``tail'' effects
caused by backscatter of the outgoing radiation off the background curved
spacetime, and yields radiation that propagates asymptotically along true null
cones of the curved spacetime. The method also yields equations of motion
through $O[(v/c)^4]$, radiation-reaction terms at $O[(v/c)^5]$ and
$O[(v/c)^7]$, and gravitational waveforms and energy flux through $O[(v/c)^4]$,
in agreement with other approaches. We report on progress in evaluating the

actions for AF spaces can be obtained from the AdS description just as taking
the limit of $\ell \to \infty$. An asymptotically flat spacetime with
non-spherical boundary is speculated. In the example, additional counterterms
to eliminate (leading) divergent terms due to deviation of boundary from round
sphere are imagined by observing (4-dimensional) holographic anomaly
proportional to $\Box R$. Argument of the deceptive-like anomaly is given by
comparing with the holographic description of 5-dimensional Kerr-AdS spacetime.

in superheavy nuclei are studied within the self-consistent Skyrme-Hartree-Fock
and Relativistic Mean-Field theories. Due to the presence of low-lying proton
continuum resulting in a free particle gas, special attention is paid to the
treatment of single-particle level density. To cure the pathological behavior
of shell correction around the particle threshold, the method based on the
Green's function approach has been adopted. It is demonstrated that for the
vast majority of Skyrme interactions commonly employed in nuclear structure
calculations, the strongest shell stabilization appears for Z=124, and 126, and
for N=184. On the other hand, in the relativistic approaches the strongest
spherical shell effect appears systematically for Z=120 and N=172. This
difference has probably its roots in the spin-orbit potential. We have also
shown that, in contrast to shell corrections which are fairly independent on
the force, macroscopic energies extracted from self-consistent calculations
strongly depend on the actual force parametrisation used. That is, the A and Z
dependence of mass surface when extrapolating to unknown superheavy nuclei is
prone to significant theoretical uncertainties.

wavefunctions, with appropriate symmetrization. These states may be potentially
useful for quantum computation. There may be robustness and stability due to
macroscopic occupation of a same single particle state. The nonlinearity of the
condensate wavefunction due to particle-particle interaction may be utilized to
realize nonlinear quantum computation, which was suggested to be capable of
solving NP-complete problems.

Mechanics. Indeed, the emphasis is on the role played by the {\it entire family
of classical trajectories} in terms of which the path integral is computed
exactly using a functional representation of the Dirac delta-distribution. We
argue that the new algorithm leads to a deeper insight into the connection
between classical and quantum systems, especially those encountered in high
