from five southern observatories, span a period from the initial alert until
the end of the event. Our data are incompatible with a static binary lens, but
are well fit by a rotating binary lens of mass ratio q=0.34 and angular
separation d ~ 0.5 (in units of the Einstein ring radius) in which the binary
separation changes in size by delta d = -0.070 +/- 0.009 and in orientation by
delta theta = (5.61 +/- 0.36) degrees during the 35.17 days between the
separate caustic transits. We use this measurement combined with other
observational constraints to derive the first kinematic estimate of the mass,
distance, and period of a binary microlens. The relative probability
distributions for these parameters peak at a total lens mass M ~ 0.3 solar
masses (M-dwarf binary system), lens distance D_L ~ 5.5 kpc, and binary period
P ~ 1.5 yr. The robustness of our model is demonstrated by its striking
agreement with MACHO/GMAN data that cover several sharp features in the light
curve not probed by the PLANET observations, and which did not enter our
modeling procedure in any way. Available data sets thus indicate that the light
curve of MACHO 97-BLG-41 can be modeled as a source crossing two caustics of a
physically-realistic rotating binary so that, contrary to a recent suggestion,
the additional effects of a postulated planetary companion to the binary lens
are not required.

temporal radio behavior indicate that the fireball has undergone a transition
to sub-relativistic expansion at t~100 days. This allows us to perform
""calorimetry"" of the explosion. The derived total energy, ~5\times 10^{50} erg,
is well below the ~5\times 10^{51} erg inferred under the assumption of
spherical symmetry from gamma-ray and early afterglow observations. A natural
consequence of this result, which can also account for deviations at t<100 days
from the spherical relativistic fireball model predictions, is that the
fireball was initially a wide-angle jet of opening angle ~30 degrees.
  Our analysis also allows to determine the energy fractions carried by
electrons and magnetic field, and the density of ambient medium surrounding the
fireball. We find that during the sub-relativistic expansion electrons and
magnetic field are close to equipartition, and that the density of the ambient
medium is ~1/cm^3. The inferred density rules out the possibility that the

Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are characteristically
double-humped, with lower-energy emission originating as synchrotron radiation
in a relativistically beamed jet, and higher-energy emission due to
inverse-Compton processes. This has accentuated the biases inherent in any
survey to favor objects which are bright in the survey band, and should serve
as a cautionary note both to those designing new surveys as well as theorists
attempting to model blazar properties. The location of the synchrotron peak
determines which blazar population is dominant at GeV and TeV energies. At GeV
energies, low-energy peaked, high luminosity objects, which have high $L_C/L_S$
ratios, dominate, while at TeV energies, high-energy peaked objects are all
that is seen. I review the differences between low-energy peaked and
high-energy peaked blazars, and models to explain those differences. I also
look at efforts to bridge the gap between these classes with new surveys. Two
new surveys have detected a large population of high-energy peaked emission
line blazars (FSRQ), with properties somewhat different from previously known
objects. This discovery has the potential to revolutionize blazar physics in a
way comparable to the discovery of X-ray selected BL Lacs ten years ago by {\it

source consisted of a dominant, compact component, essentially identical to the
structure seen outside the event. However, the source's diameter increased
slightly at 13 cm during the ESE. An increase in the source's diameter is
inconsistent with a simple refractive model. We also see no evidence for
ESE-induced substructure within the source or the formation of multiple images,
as would occur in a strongly refractive lens. However, a model in which the
decrease in flux density during the ESE occurs solely because of stochastic
broadening within the lens requires a larger broadening diameter during the ESE
than is observed. Thus, the ESE toward 1741-038 involved both stochastic
broadening and refractive defocussing within the lens. If the structure
responsible for the ESE has a size of order 1 AU, the level of scattering
within an ESE lens may be a factor of 10^7 larger than that in the ambient
medium. A filamentary structure could reduce the difference between the
strength of scattering in the lens and ambient medium, but we conclude that, if
ESEs arise from filamentary structures, they occur when the filamentary
structures are seen lengthwise. We predict the amount of pulse broadening that
would result from a comparable lens passing in front of a pulsar. The pulse
broadening would be no more than 1.1 microseconds, consistent with the lack of
pulse broadening detected during ESEs toward the pulsars PSR B1937+21 and PSR

derived for the one-dimensional subsystems. Then the Luttinger parameters,
which determine the low-temperature susceptibilities of the chains and ladders,
are calculated from the Bethe ansatz solution for these effective models. The
3D ordering transition line is obtained using a random phase approximation for
the weak inter-chain (inter-ladder) coupling. Finally, considering a Ginzburg
criterion, the fluctuation corrections to this approach are shown to be small.
The nature of the 3D ordered phase resembles a Bose condensate of integer-spin

e.g. N-leg spin-1/2 ladders, multi-component condensates can occur at high

We introduce a new variable called order parameter that accounts for possible
correlations in the vehicle motion at different lanes. So, it is principally
due to the ""many-body"" effects in the car interaction, which enables us to
regard it as an additional independent state variable of traffic flow. Basing
on the latest experimental data (cond-mat/9905216) we assume that these
correlations are due to a small group of ""fast"" drivers. Taking into account
the general properties of the driver behavior we write the governing equation
for the order parameter. In this context we analyze the instability of
homogeneous traffic flow manifesting itself in both of the mentioned above
phase transitions where, in addition, the transition ""synchronized motion ->
jam"" also exhibits a similar hysteresis. Besides, the jam is characterized by
the vehicle flows at different lanes being independent of one another. We
specify a certain simplified model in order to study the general features of
the car cluster self-formation under the phase transition ""free flow <->

motion only.

boundary, that is the line $\mathbb{R}^1$ or a circle $S^1$. The classification
of path-components of the space of Morse maps from $M$ into $P$ was recently
obtained by S. V. Matveev and V. V. Sharko for the case $P=\mathbb{R}$. For
$P=S^1$ the classification was obtained by the author. All this results can be
reformulated as one theorem: ""Two Morse maps $f,g:M \to P$ belong to the same
path component of a space of Morse mappings from $M$ into $P$ if and only if
they are homotopic and have the same number of crutucal points in each index
and the same sets of positive and negative boundary circles"". Here we give
another independent proof of this theorem based on Lickorish's theorem on
generators of homeotopy group of surface.

characterization of what they call EPR-states on a bipartite composite quantum

pairs of observables in the two subsystems, and the task is to determine all
such correlated pairs for a given state. In this note the argument is shortened
and simplified, and at the same time extended to observables in general von
Neumann algebras, which naturally arise in quantum field theory.

confinement integrability criterion in the case of discrete Painlev\'e
equations. The method used is based on the requirement of non-exponential
growth of the homogeneous degree of the iterate of the mapping. We show that
when we start from an integrable autonomous mapping and deautonomise it using
singularity confinement the degrees of growth of the nonautonomous mapping and
of the autonomous one are identical. Thus this low-growth based approach is
compatible with the integrability of the results obtained through singularity
confinement. The origin of the singularity confinement property and its
necessary character for integrability are also analysed.
