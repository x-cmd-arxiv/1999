silicon-rich ejecta from explosive oxygen-burning. Remarkably, our study finds
that the Fe-rich ejecta lies outside the Si-rich material, leading to the
conclusion that bulk motions of the ejecta were extensive and energetic enough
in Cas A to cause a spatial inversion of a significant portion of the supernova

``Fe''-rich ejecta emerging in plumes from the rising bubbles in the
neutrino-driven convection layer. In addition the radioactive decay energy from

inevitable consequence of interstellar turbulence, but could also be generated
by variability and anisotropy in a precursor wind from the GRB progenitor.
Detection of their properties could provide important clues about the
environments of GRB sources. We apply our calculations to GRB990510, where an
rms scatter of 2% was observed for the optical flux fluctuations on the 0.1--2
hour timescale during the first day of the afterglow, consistent with it being
entirely due to photometric noise (Stanek et al. 1999). The resulting upper
limits on the density fluctuations on scales of 20-200 AU around the source of
GRB990510, are lower than the inferred fluctuation amplitude on similar scales

curve over the 3 years of observations shows several flare-like events, one of
which (in January 1996) is associated with an optical flare (R=16.1) but with a
delay of 55 days. The OSSE/BATSE spectral analysis indicates that the source is
characterized by a flat power spectrum (Gamma about 1.1 - 1.3) when in a low
state; this spectral form is consistent within errors with the ASCA and ROSAT
spectra. This means that the power law observed from 0.1 to 10 keV extends up
to at least 1 MeV but steepens soon after to meet EGRET high energy data. BATSE
data taken around the January 1996 flare suggests that the spectrum could be
steeper when the source is in a bright state. The nuF-nu representation of the
source is typical of a low frequency peaked/gamma-ray dominated blazar, with
the synchrotron peak in the mm-FIR band and the Compton peak in the MeV band.
The BATSE and OSSE spectral data seem to favour a model in which the high
energy flux is due to the sum of the synchrotron self-Compton and the external
Compton contributions; this is also supported by the variability behaviour of
the source.

two-colour mosaic of deep WFPC2 images. The small corrections for the size of
the PSF and the high number density of background galaxies obtained in these
observations result in an accurate and well calibrated measurement of the
lensing induced distortion. The strength of the lensing signal depends on the
redshift distribution of the background galaxies. We used photometric redshift
distributions from the Northern and Southern Hubble Deep Fields to relate the
lensing signal to the mass. The predicted variations of the signal as a
function of apparent source magnitude and colour agrees well with the observed
lensing signal. We determine a mass of (1.2+-0.2)x10^15 Msun within an aperture
of radius 1 Mpc. Under the assumption of an isothermal mass distribution, the
corresponding velocity dispersion is 1311^{+83}_{-89} km/s. For the
mass-to-light ratio we find 269+-37 Msun/Lsun. The errors in the mass and
mass-to-light ratio include the contribution from the random intrinsic
ellipticities of the source galaxies, but not the (systematic) error due to the
uncertainty in the redshift distribution. However, the estimates for the mass
and mass-to-light ratio of MS 1054-03 agree well with other estimators,
suggesting that the mass calibration works well. The reconstruction of the
projected mass surface density shows a complex mass distribution, consistent
with the light distribution. The results indicate that MS 1054-03 is a young
system. The timescale for relaxation is estimated to be at least 1 Gyr.

probe the relationship between the galaxy distribution and the mass
distribution. The pairwise line-of-sight velocity dispersion of galaxies is
sensitive to the number of galaxies present in halos of different mass. The
galaxy velocity dispersion is ~40% lower than that of the dark matter and is in
reasonable agreement with the values measured in the Las Campanas redshift
survey by Jing et al. over two decades in pair separation. The origin of this
offset is statistical rather than dynamical, and depends upon the relative
efficiency of galaxy formation in dark matter halos of different mass. Although
the model galaxies and the dark matter have markedly different correlation
functions in real space, such biases conspire to cause the redshift space
correlation functions to be remarkably similar to each other. The predicted
redshift-space galaxy correlation function agrees well with observations. We
find no evidence in the model for a dependence of clustering strength on
intrinsic galaxy luminosity, unless extremely bright galaxies, two magnitudes
brighter than L*, are considered. However, there are significant differences
when model galaxies are selected either by morphology or by colour. Early type
or red galaxies show a much stronger clustering amplitude than late type or

field strengths of the very old neutron stars, and distribution of the magnetic
fields versus orbital periods in low-mass binary pulsars are used to test the
adopted field decay models. Contrary to the earlier claims, the buoyancy is
argued to be the dominant driving cause of the flux expulsion, for the single
as well as the binary neutron stars. However, the pinning is also found to play
a crucial role which is necessary to account for the observed low field binary
and millisecond pulsars.

considerable delay of the core flux expulsion if the initial field strength is

relatively weak initial magnetic field $B \approx 10^{11}$ G. The expulsion
time-scale depends not only on the conductivity of the crust, but also on the

the longitudinal and transverse current correlation function, respectively. For
wave-vectors q>0.4 Angstrom^{-1} the spectra are sitting on top of a flat
background which is due to multiphonon excitations. In the acoustic frequency
band, i.e. for nu<20 THz, the intensity of J_l(q,nu) and J_t(q,nu) in the
liquid and the glass approximately proportional to temperature, in agreement
with the harmonic approximation. In contrast to this, strong deviations from a
linear scaling are found for nu>20 THz. The dynamic structure factor S(q,nu)
exhibits for q>0.23 Angstrom^{-1} a boson peak which is located nearly
independent of q around 1.7 THz. We show that the low frequency part of the
boson peak is mainly due to the elastic scattering of transverse acoustic modes
with frequencies around 1 THz. The strength of this scattering depends on q and
is largest around q=1.7 Angstrom^{-1}, the location of the first sharp
diffraction peak in the static structure factor. By studying S(q,nu) for
different system sizes we show that strong finite size effects are present in
the low frequency part of the boson peak in that for small systems part of its
intensity is missing. We discuss the consequences of these finite size effects

several paths from a conventional critical point to SOC. They begin with an

and impose supervision or driving on the system; two commonly used methods are
extremal dynamics, and driving at a rate approaching zero. We illustrate this
in sandpiles, where SOC is a consequence of slow driving in a system exhibiting
an absorbing-state phase transition with a conserved density. Other paths to
SOC, in driven interfaces, the Bak-Sneppen model, and self-organized directed
percolation, are also examined. We review the status of experimental

understanding how radiation reaction drives the evolution of a binary system,
particularly in the extreme mass ratio limit. Such research is of direct
relevance to gravitational-wave sources for space-based detectors (such as
LISA). We present here a study of the radiative evolution of circular (i.e.,
constant Boyer-Lindquist coordinate radius), non-equatorial Kerr black hole
orbits. Recent theorems have shown that, at least in an adiabatic evolution,
such orbits evolve from one circular configuration into another, changing only
their radius and inclination angle. This constrains the system's evolution in
such a way that the change in its Carter constant can be deduced from knowledge
of gravitational wave fluxes propagating to infinity and down the black hole's
horizon. Thus, in this particular case, a local radiation reaction force is not
needed. In accordance with post-Newtonian weak-field predictions, we find that
inclined orbits radiatively evolve to larger inclination angles (although the
post-Newtonian prediction overestimates the rate of this evolution in the
strong field by a factor $\lesssim 3$). We also find that the gravitational
waveforms emitted by these orbits are rather complicated, particularly when the
hole is rapidly spinning, as the radiation is influenced by many harmonics of
the orbital frequencies.

of gauge mediated SUSY breaking. The idea is that for some boundary condition
of the scalar (Higgs and stop) masses, the Higgs (mass)$^2$, evaluated at the
renormalization scale $\sim O(100)$ GeV, is not very sensitive to (boundary
values of) the scalar masses (this has been called ``focussing'' in recent
literature). Then, the stop masses can be multi-TeV without leading to
fine-tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking. {\em Minimal} gauge mediation
does {\em not} lead to this focussing (for all values of $\tan \beta$ and the
messenger scale): the (boundary value of) the Higgs mass is too small compared
to the stop masses. Also, in minimal gauge mediation, the gaugino masses are of
the same order as the scalar masses so that multi-TeV scalars implies multi-TeV
gauginos (especially gluino) leading to fine-tuning. We discuss ideas to {\em
increase} the Higgs mass relative to the stop masses (so that focussing can be
achieved) and also to {\em suppress} gaugino masses relative to scalar masses
(or to modify the gaugino mass relations) in {\em non-minimal} models of gauge
mediation -- then multi-TeV (top and other) squarks can be natural. Specific
models of gauge mediation which incorporate these ideas and thus have squarks
(and in some cases, the gluino) heavier than a TeV without resulting in
fine-tuning are also studied and their collider signals are contrasted with
those of other models which have multi-TeV squarks.

a 5-D Universe with localized gravity has been studied previously. In the
radiation-dominated Universe, it was suggested that there are two solutions for
the cosmic scale factor a(t) : the standard solution $a\sim t^{1/2}$, and a
solution $a\sim t^{1/4}$, which is incompatible with standard big bang
nucleosynthesis. In this note, we reconsider expansion of the Universe in this
scenario. We derive and solve a first order, linear differential equation for
H^2, the square of the expansion rate of the Universe, as a function of a. The
differences between our equation for H^2 and the relationship found in standard
cosmology are (i) there is a term proportional to density squared (a fact
already known), which is small when the density is small compared to the brane
tension, and (ii) there is a contribution which acts like a relativistic fluid.
We show that this second contribution is due to gravitational degrees of
freedom in the bulk. Thus, we find that there need not be any conflict between
cosmology of the Randall-Sundrum scenario and the standard model of cosmology.
We discuss how reheating at the end of inflation leads to the correct
relationship between matter density and expansion rate, $H^2\to 8\pi
G\rho_m/3$, and the conditions that must be met for the expansion rate of the
Universe to be close to its standard model value around the epoch of
cosmological nucleosynthesis.

proposed recently is applied to $A$=46, 48 and 50 nuclei in the $fp$ shell
region.
  Exact shell model calculations in the truncated model space
  $(f_{7/2},p_{3/2},p_{1/2})$ prove the usefulness of the interaction.
  The simple model with the pairing plus quadrupole pairing plus $QQ$ force and
$J$-independent isoscalar proton-neutron force reproduces unexpectedly well
observed binding energies, energy levels of collective (yrast) states and
reduced $E2$ transition probabilities in $^{46}$Ti, $^{46}$V, $^{48}$V,
$^{48}$Cr, $^{50}$Cr and $^{50}$Mn.
  The correspondence between theory and experiment is almost comparable to that
attained by the full $fp$ shell model calculations with realistic effective
interactions. Some predictions are made for energy levels and variations of
$B(E2)$ in the yrast bands, in these nuclei. Characteristics of the interaction
are investigated by comparing with the realistic effective interactions.

charge distributions obtained by taking $m_1\to\infty$ and $m_2\to\infty$
respectively, while keeping the same Coulombic potential. We provide a simple
scaling criterion to determine whether an arbitrary Hamiltonian possesses this
property. In particular we show that, for a Coulombic system, fine structure
corrections preserve this Crater property while two-particle relativistic
corrections and/or hyperfine corrections may destroy it.

four kinds of bases within DNA. The transition matrix analysis of DNA sequences
shows that some measures of complexity based on transition proportion matrix
are of interest. We use some measures of complexity to distinguish exon and
intron. Regarding the evolution, we find that for species of higher grade, the
transition rate among the four kinds of bases goes further from the
equilibrium.

being erected at La Silla (Chile), Mauna Kea (Hawai), Las Palmas (Canary
Island), and Calar Alto (Spain), to name a view. In 1990, at the beginning of
The Decade of Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics (Bahcall [2]), the UN/ESA
Workshops on Basic Space Science initiated the establishment of small
astronomical telescope facilities, among them many particularly supported by
Japan, in developing countries in Asia and the Pacific (Sri Lanka,
Philippines), Latin America and the Caribbean (Colombia, Costa
  Rica, Honduras, Paraguay), and Western Asia (Egypt, Jordan, Morocco). The
annual UN/ESA Workshops continue to pursue an agenda to network these small
observatory facilities through similar research and education programmes and at
the same time encourage the incorporation of cultural elements predominant in
the respective cultures. Cross-cultural integration and multi-lingual
scientific cooperation may well be a dominant theme in the new millennium
(Pyenson [20]). This trend is supported by the notion that astronomy has deep
roots in virtually every human culture, that it helps to understand humanity's
place in the vast scale of the Universe, and that it increases the knowledge of
humanity about its origins and evolution=2E Two of these Workshops have been
organized in Europe (Germany 1996 and France 2000) to strengthen cooperation
between developing and industrialized countries.
