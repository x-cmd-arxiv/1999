Hubble Deep Field South and its flanking fields. Here we consider only those
sources greater than 100 microJy at 20 cm, in an 8-arcmin square field that
covers the WFPC field, the STIS and NICMOS field, and most of the HST flanking
fields and complementary ground-based observations. We have detected 13 such
radio sources, two of which are in the WFPC2 field itself. One of the sources
in the WFPC field (source c) corresponds to a very faint galaxy, and several
others outside the WFPC field can not be identified with sources in the other
optical/IR wavebands. The radio and optical luminosities of these galaxies are
inconsistent with either conventional starburst galaxies or with radio-loud
galaxies. Instead, it appears that it belongs to a population of galaxies which
are rare in the local Universe, possibly consisting of a radio-luminous active
nucleus embedded in a very dusty starburst galaxy, and which are characterised
by a very high radio/optical luminosity ratio.

the relaxation process between ions and electrons in intracluster medium by
N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. In the contracting phase a bow shock is
formed between the two subclusters. The observed temperature between two peaks
in this phase depends on the viewing angle even if the geometry of the system
seems to be very simple like head-on collisions. Around the most contracting
epoch, when we observe merging clusters nearly along the collision axis, they
look like spherical relaxed clusters with large temperature gradients. In the
expanding phase, spiral bow shocks occur. As in head-on mergers, the electron
temperature is significantly lower than the plasma mean one especially in the
post-shock regions in the expanding phase. When the systems have relatively
large angular momentum, double-peak structures in the X-ray images can survive
even after the most contracting epoch. Morphological features in both X-ray
images and electron temperature distribution characteristic to off-center
mergers are seriously affected by the viewing angle. When the clusters are
observed nearly along the collision axis, the distribution of galaxies'
line-of-sight (LOS) velocities is a good indicator of mergers. In the
contracting phase, an negative kurtosis and a large skewness are expected for
nearly equal mass collisions and rather different mass ones, respectively. To
obtain statistically significant results, about 1000 galaxies' LOS velocities
are required. For nearby clusters ($z<0.05$), large redshift surveys such as
2dF will enable us to study merger dynamics.

source population. Using the WENSS survey, we have selected a complete sample
of these sources. We have investigated the properties of their radio
structures. We find, among other things, that these sources are old (50-100
Myr) and have higher advance velocities than smaller sources of similar radio
power. We find pressure gradients in their radio lobes, suggesting that the
lobes are still overpressured with respect to the environment. Further, we find
no evidence for a cosmological evolution of the radio lobe pressures with
increasing redshift, at least up to $z\sim 0.4$, other than that caused by
selection effects. We argue that a much fainter sample of giant sources than
currently available is needed to constrain the pressure in their environments,
the IGM. Another extremely important discovery is that of a population of radio
sources with a so-called `double-double' structure, i.e. that of a small
two-sided radio source embedded inside a much larger two-sided structure. We
argue that these sources result from an interrupted central jet-forming
activity. As such, they are the most convincing examples of radio sources with
a history of interrupted activity, yet. Since the inner lobes advance within
the outer lobes, high resolution low frequency ($\sim 200$ MHz) polarization
studies may reveal the constituents of radio lobes and cocoons. We thus argue
for a SKA design that can provide low-frequency images at arcsec resolution,
but which is also sensitive to structures as large as a few tens of arcminute
on the sky.

fourteen B Ia and Ib - supergiants (spectral type B0 to B3) in the solar
neighbourhood are analyzed by means of NLTE unified model atmospheres to
determine the properties of their stellar winds, in particular their wind
momenta. As in previous work for O-stars (Puls et al.) a tight relationship
between stellar wind momentum and luminosity (`WLR'') is found. However, the
WLR varies as function of spectral type. Wind momenta are strongest for
O-supergiants, then decrease from early B (B0 and B1) to mid B (B1.5 to B3)
spectral types and become stronger again for A-supergiants. The slope of the
WLR appears to be steeper for A- and mid B-supergiants than for O-supergiants.
The spectral type dependence is interpreted as an effect of ionization changing
the effective number and the line strength distribution function of spectral
lines absorbing photon momentum around the stellar flux maximum. This
interpretation needs to be confirmed by theoretical calculations for radiation
driven winds.
  A-supergiants in M31 observed with HIRES at the Keck telescope have wind
momenta compatible with their galactic counterparts.
  The potential of the WLR as a new, independent extragalactic distance
indicator is discussed. It is concluded that with ten to twenty objects,
photometry with HST and medium resolution spectroscopy with 8m-telescopes from
the ground distance moduli can be obtained with an accuracy of about 0.1m out

in causing motional narrowing of muSR lineshapes is quantified in terms of a
first-principles theory of the flux-lattice melting transition. The effects of
random point pinning are investigated using a replica treatment of liquid state
correlations and a replicated density functional theory. Our results indicate
that motional narrowing in the pure system, although substantial, cannot
account for the remarkably small linewidths obtained experimentally at
relatively high fields and low temperatures. We find that satisfactory
agreement with the muSR data for BSCCO in this regime can be obtained through
the ansatz that this ``phase'' is characterized by frozen short-range
positional correlations reflecting the structure of the liquid just above the
melting transition. This proposal is consistent with recent suggestions of a
``pinned liquid'' or ``glassy'' state of pancake vortices in the presence of
pinning disorder. Our results for the high-temperature liquid phase indicate
that measurable linewidths may be obtained in this phase as a consequence of
density inhomogeneities induced by the pinning disorder. The results presented
here comprise a unified, first-principles theoretical treatment of muSR spectra

disordered systems, which reveal similar features but also important
differences. We argue that a generic model that reproduce many of these
features is that of {\it pinned defects} in a disordered environment, hopping
between different metastable states. The fact that energy barriers grow with
the size of the reconforming regions immediately leads to a strong hierarchy of
time scales. In particular, long wavelength glassy, aging modes and short
wavelength equilibrated modes coexist in the system and offer a simple
mechanism to explain the rejuvenation/memory effect, which does not rely on
`chaos' with temperature. These properties can be discussed within simplified
models (such as the Sinai model) where the dynamics of the whole pinned object
is reduced to that of its center of mass in a disordered potential. While the
experiments in random ferromagnet-like systems can be satisfactorily accounted
for, the correct picture for the aging dynamics of spin-glasses is still
missing. Following recent ideas of Houdayer and Martin, we propose the idea
that the ordered phase a spin-glass contains a large number of pinned, zero
tension walls. Finally, we briefly discuss the status of the mean-field
theories of aging.

eigenvalue spectrum of the Dirac operator. The model is by necessity,
approximate, though it does incorporate the important symmetries of the
underlying field theory. The model also reproduces classical results in the
appropriate limits. We find that generic instanton ensembles lead to an
accumulation of eigenvalues around zero, and hence, break chiral symmetry. The
eigenvalue spectrum is divergent however, as the eigenvalue approaches zero.
This leads to a divergent chiral condensate in quenched QCD, and hence, shows
the theory to be pathological. In full QCD we find the novel result of a
divergent spectral density leading to chiral symmetry breaking, but, with a
finite condensate. This result holds for both $N_{f}=1$ and $N_{f}=2$. We also
compute correlation functions and find a massive $\eta^{'}$ and $\sigma$ in the
chiral limit. Whilst the divergence follows a power law, the strength of the
divergence is inversely proportional to the instanton density. To investigate
the impact of the divergence further, we analyse instanton ensembles derived by
""cooling"" lattice gauge configurations. An important negative result is that
the chiral condensate is strongly dependent upon the number of cooling sweeps
performed. Whether the problem lies with cooling or with the identification of

spectrum typically exhibit both full and fractional revivals. It is shown that
the latter can be eliminated by inducing suitable geometric phases in the
states, by varying the parameters in the Hamiltonian cyclically with a period
T. Further, with the introduction of this natural time step T, the occurrence
of near revivals can be mapped onto that of Poincar\'{e} recurrences in an
irrational rotation map of the circle. The distinctive recurrence time
statistics of the latter can thus serve as a clear signature of the dynamics of
wave packet revivals.

varying oscillator Hamiltonian are examined. The revival time distribution is
exactly that of Poincar\'{e} recurrences for a rotation map: only three
distinct revival times can occur, with specified weights. A link is thus
established between quantum revivals and recurrences in a coarse-grained
discrete-time dynamical system.

sub-Poissonian noise) are degraded when it is transmitted through an amplifying

direct photodetection and of homodyne detection are considered. Explicit
results are obtained for the dependence of the Fano factor (the ratio of the
noise power and the mean current) on the degree of squeezing of the incident
state, on the length and the mean free path of the medium, the temperature, and
on the absorption or amplification rate.
