many voids along the line-of-sight to quasars compared with the observed flux
distribution and the distribution in a Cold Dark Matter model. This supports
the common view that on large scales the universe is homogeneous, rather than
fractal-like.

thin disk are calculated in the critical-state model assuming a field-dependent
critical current density, Jc(B). The results are obtained by solving
numerically the set of coupled integral equations for the flux and current
distributions [PRB 60(17) p.13112 (1999)] for a disk placed in a perpendicular
applied field Ba. From the magnetization curves the range of fields where the
vertical width of the loop relates directly to Jc(Ba) is determined. Comparing
our results on susceptibility with experimental data for parametric plot
Im(chi) vs. Re(chi) shows that by taking the B-dependence of Jc into account
the agreement improves dramatically. We show that the asymptotic behavior for
large ac-field amplitudes Bam changes from Re(chi) ~ 1/Bam^{3/2} and Im(chi) ~
1/Bam for the Bean model, to Re(chi) ~ 1/Bam^3 and Im(chi) ~ 1/Bam^2 for Jc
decreasing with |B| as 1/|B| or faster. For small Bam the behavior can always
be described by an effective Bean model with a renormalized Jc. We also find
that in the Im(chi) vs. Re(chi) plot the peak of Im(chi) increases in magnitude
and shifts to lower |Re(chi)|. This allows an easy experimental discrimination
between a Bean model behavior, one with Jc(B), and one where flux creep is an
ingredient.

a cross-over between a nonlinearity-dominated regime and a solitonic one, the
latest being the final steady state of the propagating wave. In the case of
large values of $\alpha$ the deformation field given by the numerical
simulations is completely different from the one obtained by analytical
calculation. In the following we studied the interaction of these shock waves
with a mass impurity placed in the bead chain. Two different physical pictures
emerge whether we consider a light or a heavy impurity mass. The scatter of the
shock wave with a light impurity yields damped oscillations of the impurity
which then behave as a solitary wave source. Differently an heavy impurity is
just shifted by the shock and the transmitted wave loses its solitonic
character being fragmented into waves of decreasing amplitudes.

for degenerate four-wave mixing in mesoscopic interaction volumes of condensed
media developed by the present authors [T. Andersen and O. Keller, Phys.
Scripta 58, 132 (1998)]. The analytical solution is supplemented by a numerical
analysis of the phase conjugated response from a two-level quantum well in the
case where one level is below the Fermi level and the other level is above.
This is the simplest configuration of a quantum well phase conjugator in which
the light-matter interaction can be tuned to resonance. The phase conjugated
response is examined in the case where all the scattering takes place in one
plane, and linearly polarized light is used in the mixing. In the numerical
work we study a two-monolayer thick copper quantum well using the infinite
barrier model potential. Our results show that the phase conjugated response
from such a quantum-well system is highly dependent on the spatial dispersion
of the matter response. The resonances showing up in the numerical results are
analytically identified from the expressions for the linear and nonlinear
response tensors. In addition to the general discussion of the phase conjugated
response with varying frequency and parallel component of the wavevector, we
present the phase conjugated response in the special case where the light is in
resonance with the interband transition.

metric is derived from a single scalar field $\Phi$. The field equation,
derived from a simple variational principle, is a non-linear flat-space
four-dimensional wave equation which is particularly suited for numerical
evolution. We demonstrate that while this theory does not generate results
which are exactly identical quantitatively to those of general relativity (GR),
many of the qualitative features of the full GR theory are reproduced to a
reasonable approximation. The advantage of this formulation lies in the fact
that 3D numerical grids can be numerically evolved in minutes or hours instead
of the days and weeks required by GR, thus drastically reducing the development
time of new relativistic hydrodynamical codes. Scalar gravity therefore serves
as a meaningful testbed for the development of larger routines destined for use
under the full theory of general relativity.

B-field we can have large Kaluza-Klein thresholds even in the small volume

a compactification on a non-commutative space (e.g., a torus or an orbifold
thereof). Based on this observation we discuss a brane world scenario of
non-commutative unification via Kaluza-Klein thresholds. In this scenario, the
unification scale can be lowered down to the TeV-range, yet the corresponding
compactification radii are smaller than the string length. We discuss a
potential application of this scenario in the context of obtaining mixing
between different chiral generations which is not exponentially suppressed - as
we point out, such mixing is expected to be exponentially suppressed in certain
setups with large volume compactifications. We also point out that T-duality is
broken by certain non-perturbative twisted open string sectors which are
supposed to give rise to chiral generations, so that in the case of a small
volume compactification with a rational B-field we cannot T-dualize to a large
volume description. In this sense, the corresponding field theoretic picture of
unification via Kaluza-Klein thresholds in this setup is best described in the
non-commutative language.
