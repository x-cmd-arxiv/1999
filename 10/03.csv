propose the skeleton tree formalism, which can analytically distinguish the
episodic merging and the continuous accretion in the mass growth processes. The
distinction was not clear in extended Press-Schechter (PS) formalism. The
skeleton tree formalism is a natural extension of the peak theory which is an
alternative formalism for the statistics of the bound objects. The fluctuation
field smoothing with Gaussian filter produces the landscape with adding the
extra-dimension of the filter resolution scale to the spatial coordinate of the
original fluctuation. In the landscape, some smoothing peaks are nesting into
the neighboring peaks at a type of critical points called sloping saddles
appears, which can be interpreted as merging events of the objects in the
context of the hierarchical structure formation. The topological properties of
the landscape can be abstracted in skeleton trees, which consist of line
process of the smoothing peaks and the point process of the sloping saddles.
According to this abstract topological picture, in this paper, we present the
concept and the basic results of the skeleton tree formalism to describe (1)
the distinction between the accretion and the merger in the hierarchical
structure formation from various initial random Gaussian fields; (2) the
instantaneous number density of the sloping saddles which gives the
instantaneous scale function of the objects with the destruction and
reformation in the mergers; (3) the rates of the destruction, the reformation,
and the relative accretion growth; (4) the self-consistency of the formalism
for the statistics of the mass growth processes of the objects; (5) the mean
growth history of the objects at the fixed mass.

variety of high energy transients by delayed black hole formation in massive
stars endowed with rotation. Following the launch of a ``successful'' shock by
the usual neutrino powered mechanism, the inner layers of the star move
outwards, but lack adequate energy to eject all the matter exterior to the
neutron star. Over a period of minutes to hours a variable amount of mass,
about 0.1 to 5 solar masses falls back into the collapsed remnant, often
turning it into a black hole and establishing an accretion disk. The accretion
rate, about 0.001 to 0.01 solar masses per second, is inadequate to produce a
jet mediated by neutrino annihilation, but similar to that invoked in
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models for gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We thus consider
the effect of jets formed by ``fallback'' in stars that are already in the
process of exploding. We justify a parameterization of the jet power as a
constant times the mass accretion rate, $\epsilon \dot {\rm M} c^2$, and
explore the consequences of $\epsilon$ = 0.001 and 0.01. In supergiants, shock
breakout produces bright x-ray transients that might be a diagnostic of the
model. Jets produced by fallback should be more frequent than those made by the
prompt formation of a black hole and may power the most common form of
gamma-ray transient in the universe, although not the most common form seen so
far by BATSE. Those are still attributed to prompt black hole formation, but it
may be that the diverse energies observed for GRBs so far reflect chiefly the
variable collimation of the jet inside the star and a consequently highly
variable fraction of relativistic ejecta. Indeed, these events may all have a
common total energy near 10$^{52}$ erg.

  Viewing-Angle-Dependent Unified Model for Seyfert Galaxies","Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, emulateapj.sty, 20 pages",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recently growing evidence has been accumulated that the NLS1s are viewed from
nearly pole-on viewing angles. However, there has been no theoretical model
which explains the following important correlations; 1) weaker optical Fe II
emitters always have wider emission-line widths but stronger optical Fe II
emitters have either wider or narrower line widths, and 2) S1s with wider line
widths always have flatter soft X-ray spectra but S1s with narrower line widths
have either steeper or flatter soft X-ray spectra.
  Photoionization models predict that the partly-ionized zone in the broad line
region (BLR) with a disk-like configuration, in which the optical Fe II
emission is thought to arise, is very optically thick. If we observe this
disk-like BLR from an inclined viewing angle, the Fe II emitting region located
in the far-side half disk cannot be seen entirely because of the large optical
depth while almost all the Hbeta emission can be seen because the ionized
hydrogen is located in the outer surfaces of BLR clouds. This explains that the
Fe II/Hbeta ratio depends on viewing angle.
  Recent discovery of relativistic outflows in some NLS1s suggests that the
nuclear radio jet interacts with the dense ambient gas very close to the
central engine. The kinetic Doppler effect increases the soft X-ray
luminosities if we observe S1s from a nearly pole-on view given the above range
of beta. These explain why NLS1s tend to have steeper soft X-ray spectra
together with higher soft X-ray luminosities. Furthermore, the extinction of
soft X-ray photons due to dust grain above the dusty tori are expected to more
serious for the BLS1s than for the NLS1s. We thus suggest that these
orientation effects are responsible for the second important correlation.
