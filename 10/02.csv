  Kinematics and Emission Line Ratios","32 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in The Astrophysical
  Journal",,"10.1086/308456",,"astro-ph",,"  Longslit spectra of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 from the UV to near infrared
have been obtained with STIS to study the kinematics and physical conditions in
the NLR. The kinematics show evidence for three components, a low velocity
system in normal disk rotation, a high velocity system in radial outflow at a
few hundred km/s relative to the systemic velocity and an additional high
velocity system also in outflow with velocities up to 1400 km/s, in agreement
with results from STIS slitless spectroscopy (Hutchings et al., 1998, Kaiser et
al., 1999, Hutchings et al., 1999) We have explored two simple kinematic models
and suggest that radial outflow in the form of a wind is the most likely
explanation. We also present evidence indicating that the wind may be
decelerating with distance from the nucleus.
  We find that the emission line ratios along our slits are all entirely
consistent with photoionization from the nuclear continuum source. A decrease
in the [OIII]5007/H-beta and [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratios suggests that the
density decreases with distance from the nucleus. This trend is borne out by
the [SII] ratios as well. We find no strong evidence for interaction between
the radio jet and the NLR gas in either the kinematics or the emission line
ratios in agreement with the results of Kaiser et al. (1999) who find no
spatial coincidence of NLR clouds and knots in the radio jet. These results are
in contrast to other recent studies of nearby AGN which find evidence for
significant interaction between the radio source and the NLR gas.

LINER galaxy NGC 5005 with the Owens Valley Radio Observatory millimeter array.
Molecular gas is distributed in three components - a ring at a radius of about
3 kpc, a strong central condensation, and a stream to the northwest of the
nucleus but inside the 3 kpc ring. The central condensation is a disk of about
1 kpc radius with a molecular gas mass of 2 x 10^9 M_sun. The stream between
the 3 kpc ring and the nuclear disk lies on a straight dust lane seen in the
optical. If this material moves in the plane of the galaxy, it has a velocity
offset by up to ~ 150 km/s from galactic rotation. We suggest that an optically
inconspicuous stellar bar lying within the 3 kpc ring can explain the observed
gas dynamics. This bar is expected to connect the nuclear disk and the ring
along the position angle of the northwest stream. A position-velocity cut in
this direction reveals features which match the characteristic motions of gas
in a barred potential. Our model indicates that gas in the northwest stream is
on an x_1 orbit at the bar's leading edge; it is falling into the nucleus with
a large noncircular velocity, and will eventually contribute about 2 x 10^8
M_sun to the nuclear disk. If most of this material merges with the disk on its
first passage of pericenter, the gas accretion rate during the collision will
be 50 M_sun/yr. We associate the nuclear disk with an inner 2:1 Lindblad
resonance, and the 3 kpc ring with an inner 4:1 Lindblad resonance. The high
rate of bar-driven inflow and the irregular appearance of the northwest stream
suggest that a major fueling event is in progress in NGC 5005. Such episodic
(rather than continuous) gas supply can regulate the triggering of starburst
and accretion activity in galactic nuclei. (abridged)

correlation function shows a positive peak when the optical variations lead the
X-rays by about 100 days. We show that the putative correlation signal at 100
days is entirely due to the slow ($\gtorder 30$ days) components of the light
curves. During the first year or this monitoring, smoothed versions of the
light curves are nearly identical copies of each other, but scaled in amplitude
and shifted in time. However, for the next 200 days, the X-ray and optical
variations are clearly different. During the whole period, the faster-changing
components of the light curves are uncorrelated at any lag. The detection of
this lag is tentative and the significance of the correlation uncertain. If the
100-day delay is real, however, one interpretation is that that the
slowly-varying part of the X-ray emission is an echo of the optical emission,
Compton scattered from a medium located about 50-100 lt days from the optical
source. We point out that a possibly analogous phenomenon, of a lag between
hard and soft X-rays for a given variability timescale, exists in Galactic
stellar-mass accretors. Remarkably, in both cases the lag corresponds to a
light travel distance of order $10^4$ gravitational radii. Alternatively, the
lag may not represent a physical size, but for example, the timescale of an
instability propagating inward in an accretion flow, appearing first in the
optical and then in the X-rays. In any event, there is no strong correlation at
zero, or small positive, lag, ruling out an energetically-significant X-ray
reprocessed component in the optical emission.

minor extension, from the dispersion of the primordial spin parameter lambda.
Our models allow us to explain why low and high surface brightness galaxies
have the same TFR. The disk gas fractions predicted agree with the
observations. The disks formed within the growing halos have nearly exponential
surface brightness and flat rotation curves. Towards high redshifts, the
zero-point of the TFR in the H band increases while in the B-band it slightly
decreases.

asymmetric but normal SN explosion leaves a massive ($\geq1.8{\rm M_\odot}$)
and rapidly rotating neutron star, which then converts to a strange star few
days later, due to its rapid spindown. The accompanied fireball, which can be
accelerated to ultra-relativistic velocity ($\Gamma_0\sim 100$) due to the very
low baryon contamination of the strange star, flows out along the direction of
the high-velocity SN jet and subsequently produces a GRB and the following low
energy afterglows by interacting with the surrounding stellar wind. We will
also expect a very luminous supernova like SN1998bw, if a large fraction of the
conversion energy finally turns into the kinetic energy of the supernova

inappropriate for the persistence of galactic warps. Then, we have compared the

The haloes were approximated as fixed potentials, while the discs were
represented by N-body particles. We have found that the warping in the oblate
halo continues to wind up, and finally disappears. On the other hand, for the
prolate halo model, the precession rate of the outer disc increases when the
precession of the outer disc recedes from that of the inner disc, and vice
versa. Consequently, the warping in the prolate halo persisted to the end of
the simulation by retaining the alignment of the line of nodes of the warped
disc. Therefore, our results suggest that prolate haloes could sustain galactic
warps. The physical mechanism of the persistence of warp is discussed on the
basis of the torque between a halo and a disc and that between the inner and
outer regions of the disc.

number of peculiar galaxies with much stronger H$\beta$. Does this mean that
the scatter in the H$\beta$ vs. [MgFe] plane, of normal, shell- and

formation? We suggest that, owing to their apparent {\sl youth}, shell- and
pair-galaxies should have experienced at least one interaction event after
their formation. The explanation comes natural for shell- and pair-galaxies
where the signatures of interactions are evident. It is more intrigued in {\sl

$\sigma_{ab}/\sigma_c = \ell_{ab}^2/\ell_{c}^2$. In layered crystals in which
the out-of-plane transport is incoherent, $\ell_{c}$ is fixed, equal to the

has Turing-complete sets but has no many-one complete sets. In fact, we show
that in the same relativized world this class has 2-truth-table complete sets
but lacks 1-truth-table complete sets. As part of the groundwork for our
result, we prove that \rsnnp has many equivalent forms having to do with
ordered and parallel access to $\np$ and $\npinterconp$.

questions: If one is allowed one question to each of two different information
sources, does the order in which one asks the questions affect the class of
problems that one can solve with the given access? If so, which order yields
the greater computational power?
  The answers to these questions have been learned-inasfar as they can be
learned without resolving whether or not the polynomial hierarchy collapses-for
both the polynomial hierarchy and the boolean hierarchy. In the polynomial
hierarchy, query order never matters. In the boolean hierarchy, query order
sometimes does not matter and, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses,
sometimes does matter. Furthermore, the study of query order has yielded
dividends in seemingly unrelated areas, such as bottleneck computations and
downward translation of equality.
  In this article, we present some of the central results on query order. The
article is written in such a way as to encourage the reader to try his or her
own hand at proving some of these results. We also give literature pointers to
the quickly growing set of related results and applications.

order-oblivious. Yet, we also show that these ordered query classes form new

  Our present high statistics analysis includes also a simulation at
$\beta=6.8$ ($a\simeq 0.03$ fm), which allows to reach $\mu \simeq 10$ GeV.
Special care has been devoted to the finite lattice-spacing artifacts as well
as to the finite volume effects, the latter being acute at $\beta=6.8$ where
the volume is bounded by technical limits. Our main conclusion is a strong
evidence that the gluon propagator has reached three-loop asymptotic scaling,
at $\mu$ ranging from 5.6 GeV to 9.5 GeV. We buttress up this conclusion on
several demanding criteria of asymptoticity, including scheme independence. Our
fit in the 5.6 GeV to 9.5 GeV window yields $\Lambda^{\bar{{\rm MS}}} =
  319 \pm 14 ^{+10}_{-20}$ MeV, in good agreement with our previous result,
$\Lambda^{\bar{{\rm MS}}} = 295 \pm 20 $ MeV, obtained from the three gluon
vertex, but it is significantly above the Schr\""odinger functional method

tachyonic Kaluza-Klein gravitons. In general, the gravitational self-energy of
objects acquires an imaginary part. This complexity may either be interpreted
as an amplitude for the disappearance into ``nothing'', leading to the
causality and probability violation in low-energy processes, or as an artifact
of the fictitious decay into the unphysical negative energy tachyons. The
former case would put the most severe phenomenological restrictions on such
theories. In the latter case the size of extra times may be within the reach of
the proposed gravitational experiments. In such a case these experiments should
observe that the strength of the Newtonian gravity diminishes at short

distribution of zeros of the Riemann $\zeta$-function, and of some
generalizations, with the statistics of the eigenvalues of large random
matrices. It is interesting to compare the average moments of these functions
in an interval to their counterpart in random matrices, which are the
expectation values of the characteristic polynomials of the matrix. It turns
out that these expectation values are quite interesting. For instance, the
moments of order 2K scale, for unitary invariant ensembles, as the density of
eigenvalues raised to the power $K^2$ ; the prefactor turns out to be a
universal number, i.e. it is independent of the specific probability
distribution. An equivalent behaviour and prefactor had been found, as a
conjecture, within number theory. The moments of the characteristic
determinants of random matrices are computed here as limits, at coinciding
points, of multi-point correlators of determinants. These correlators are in
fact universal in Dyson's scaling limit in which the difference between the
points goes to zero, the size of the matrix goes to infinity, and their product
remains finite.

As a function of nucleon density, the rho-meson spectral function is strongly
enhanced in the invariant mass region M < 650 MeV, while the maximum, i.e. the
pole mass, is slightly shifted upwards. As a function of temperature, for fixed
nucleon density, the imaginary part of the self-energy increases further due to
Bose-enhancement. At the same time the mass shift from the real part becomes
very large. As a consequence of these medium effects, the dilepton rate in the
low-mass region M < 650 MeV increases strongly, while the peak at M = 770 MeV
disappears.

in terms of constituent quarks. The emphasis is put on the reliability of
present numerical methods used to solve the three-body problem in order to
correctly reproduce the expected asymptotic behavior of form factors. Nucleon
wave functions obtained in the hyperspherical formalism or employing Faddeev
equations have been considered. While a q**(-8) behavior is expected at high q
for a quark-quark force behaving like 1/r at short distances, it is found that
the hypercentral approximation in the hyperspherical formalism (K=0) leads to a
q**(-7) behavior. An infinite set of waves is required to get the correct
behavior. Solutions of the Faddeev equations lead to the q**(-8) behavior. The
amplitude of the corresponding term however depends on the number of partial
waves retained in the Faddeev amplitude. The convergence to the asymptotic
behavior has also been studied. Sizeable departures are observed in some cases
at squared momentum transfers as high as 50 (GeV/c)**2. It is not clear whether
these departures are of the order 1/q or 1/q**2 log q relatively to the
dominant contribution and whether the bad convergence results from truncations
in the calculations. From a comparison with the most complete Faddeev results,
a q**2 validity range is obtained for the calculation made in the
hyperspherical formalism or in the Faddeev approach with the minimum number of
amplitudes.

improve detection efficiency at low energies. We obtained the distribution of
various grades of X-ray events inside the pixel. A horizontally split two-pixel
event is generated near the channel stop which forms a straight vertical pixel
boundary whereas a vertically split two-pixel event is generated where the
potential due to the thinned gate structure forms a wavy horizontal pixel
boundary. Therefore, the effective pixel shape is not a square but is
distorted. The distribution of X-ray events clearly shows that the two etched
