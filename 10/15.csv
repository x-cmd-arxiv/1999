euclidian geometry fails. The structures of nonlinear dynamics associated with
chaos are fractal. Fractals may also be used as the geometry of social systems.
  Wavelets are introduced as a tool for fractal analysis. As an example of its
application on a social system, we use wavelet fractal analysis to compare
electrical power demand of two different places, a touristic city and a whole

to be a 2-torus in two directions, with a third axis larger than the horizon

and (ii) the temperature fluctuations are dominated by the na\""{\i}ve
Sachs-Wolfe effect; then the distribution of the temperature differences
between multiply imaged pixels is significantly wider than the uncertainty in
the differences, and the candidate is rejected at the 94% level.

Particles are thought to be accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermal
radiation. The highly variable temporal structure observed in most GRBs has
significantly constrained models. By using different methods of statistical
analysis in the time domain we find that the width of the large amplitude
pulses in GRB time histories remain remarkably constant throughout the classic
GRB phase. This is also true for small amplitude pulses. However, small and
large pulses do not have the same pulse width within a single time history. We
find a quantitative relationship between pulse amplitude and pulse width: the
smaller amplitude peaks tend to be wider, with amplitude following a power law
with an index of about -2.8. Internal shocks simulated by randomly selecting
the Lorentz factor and energy per shell are consistent with a power law
relationship. This is strong quantitative evidence that GRBs are, indeed,
caused by internal shocks. The dependency of the width-vs.-intensity
relationship on the maximum Lorentz factor provides a way to estimate that
elusive parameter. Our observed power law index indicates that \Gamma_{max} is
less or equal than 10^3. We also interpret the narrowness of the pulse width
distribution as indicating that the emission, that occurs when one shell over
takes another, is produced over a small range of distances from the central
site.

by adding proscribed amounts of heat per particle at the cluster center. I
present sequences with a universal value of this heating parameter that
simultaneously reproduce recently published observed (gas and total

amount of energy injection is consistent with constraints on the number of
supernovae needed to account for observed intracluster silicon abundances,

function (MDF) for Omega Cen. The MDF is corrected for field giant
contamination by a radial velocity membership study of a subsample of stars
spanning all abundances. As with previous studies, the MDF is very wide with a
peak near [Fe/H]=-1.7 and extending to both higher and lower abundance, but
with few stars having [Fe/H] >~ -1.2. The orbit of Omega Cen is strongly
retrograde, has small apogalacticon and is almost coplanar with the Milky Way
disk -- i.e., an orbit unlike any known for almost all Galactic globular
clusters, and unique among clusters with its horizontal branch type and [Fe/H].
We propose that the MDF and orbit of Omega Cen, when considered in light of
other unusual Omega Cen properties are consistent with a picture wherein this
object is the remains (nucleus) of a once larger satellite dwarf galaxy that
has been substantially reduced by tidal stripping. A model wherein Omega Cen
faced considerable stripping by the Galactic disk can account for the cluster's
current state. A present-day counterpart of this process may be the Sagittarius
dSph system, for which the globular cluster M54 (which has a mass similar to
Omega Cen) has been purported to be the nucleus. A larger proto-Omega Cen on a
retrograde orbit plowing through the Milky Way disk may have aided thick disk
formation both through the contribution of tidally stripped stars and through
substantial thin disk heating.

that most Lyman-limit galaxies should have a value of $\alpha$ inside that

  galaxies","10 pages A&A LaTeX, including 3 postscript figures, A&A in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The spatial distribution of stars in a disk of a galaxy can be described by a
radial scale length and a vertical scale height. The ratio of these two scale
parameters contains information on the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid,
i.e. the ratio of the vertical to radial stellar velocity dispersions of the
stars, at least at some fiducial distance from the center. The radial velocity
dispersion correlates well with the amplitude of the rotation curve and with
the disk integrated magnitude, as was found by Bottema (1993). These relations
can be understood as the result of the stellar disk being (marginally) stable
against local instabilities at all length scales. This is expressed by Toomre's
well-known criterion, which relates the sheer in the rotation to a minimum
value that the radial stellar velocity dispersion should have for stability for
a given surface density. Via the Tully-Fisher (1977) relation, the velocity
dispersion then becomes related to the integrated magnitude and hence to the
scale length. The vertical velocity dispersion relates directly to the scale
height through hydrostatic equilibrium. It can be shown that the ratio of the
two length scales relates to the axis ratio of the velocity ellipsoid only
through the Toomre parameter Q and in particular does not require a choice of
the mass-to-light ratio or a distance scale.
  We have applied this to the statistically complete sample of edge-on
galaxies, for which de Grijs (1997) has performed surface photometry and has
determined the length scales in the stellar light distribution.

the formalism developped by Azaria et al we extend their analysis of the
isotropic $J_1=J_2$, h=0 case and obtain the low-energy effective theory near
the SU(4) point in the asymmetric case. An accurate analysis of the
renormalization group flow is presented with a particular emphasis on the
effect of the anisotropy. In zero magnetic field, we retrieve the same
qualitative low-energy physics than in the isotropic case. In particular, the
massless behavior found on the line $J_1=J_2>K/4$ extends in a large
anisotropic region. We discover though that the anisotropy plays its trick in
allowing non trivial scaling behaviors of the physical quantities. When a
magnetic field is present the effect of the anisotropy is striking. In addition
to the usual commensurate-incommensurate phase transition that occurs in the
spin sector of the theory, we find that the field may induce a second
transition of the KT type in the remaining degrees of freedom to which it does
not couple directly. In this sector, we find that the effective theory is that
of an SO(4) Gross-Neveu model with an h-dependent coupling that may change its

can be obtained by solving a decoupled Schwinger-Dyson type integral equation
for this vertex. This integral equation represents the resummation of an
infinite series of ladder diagrams which contribute to the leading order
result. It can be shown that this integral equation has exactly the same form
as the Boltzmann equation. We show that the integral equation for the viscosity
can be reexpressed by writing the vertex as a combination of polarization
tensors. An expression for this polarization tensor can be obtained by solving
another Schwinger-Dyson type integral equation. This procedure results in an
expression for the viscosity that represents a non-perturbative resummation of
contributions to the viscosity which includes certain non-ladder graphs, as
well as the usual ladders. We discuss the motivation for this resummation. We
show that these resummations can also be obtained by writing the viscosity as
an integral equation involving a single four-point function. Finally, we show
that when the viscosity is expressed in terms of a four-point function, it is
possible to further extend the set of graphs included in the resummation by
treating vertex and propagator corrections self-consistently. We discuss the

Overhauser effect, while for a large number of colors the opposite takes place,
in agreement with a recent renormalization group argument. In strong coupling
with large pairing energies, the Overhauser effect may be dominant for any
number of colors, suggesting that QCD may crystallize into an insulator at a
few times nuclear matter density, a situation reminiscent of dense Skyrmions.
The Overhauser effect is dominant in QCD in 1+1 dimensions, although
susceptible to quantum effects. It is sensitive to temperature in all
dimensions.

dark matter works better than having the needed $\sim5$ eV of neutrino mass in
one species of neutrino, and this is consistent with the only model which fits
all present indications for neutrino mass: $\nu_\mu\to\nu_\tau$ accounting for
the atmospheric anomaly (with $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ being the hot dark
matter), $\bar\nu_\mu\to\bar\nu_e$ being observed by LSND, and $\nu_e\to\nu_s$
explaining the solar $\nu_e$ deficit. The LSND/KARMEN results are consistent
with the needed mass of hot dark matter. Further support for this mass pattern
is provided by the need for the sterile neutrino, $\nu_s$, to make possible
heavy-element nucleosynthesis in supernovae. It is a fascinating question as to
whether the hot dark matter paradox will be resolved by better measurements or
by the introduction of new physics.

The classical BRST complex and the Weil algebra arise as special cases. We
recover the Courant algebroid via the derived bracket construction and give a

beat-to-beat RR interval time series obtained from an electrocardiogram (ECG).
The dysrhythmia, resulting from the co-existence of two pacemakers, the sinus
node and an ectopic focus, presents distinctive regular patterns, with
transitions from one pattern to another occurring abruptly. It is shown that
the parasystolic rhythm can be simulated by a model involving two oscillators
firing at fixed rates, under the restriction that neither is allowed to fire
during the other's refractory period. It is found that the structure of the
generated RR time series is essentially determined by the ratio of the period
of the two oscillators. In the case of a heart-transplant patient with a small
heart-rate variability as a result of heart denervation, the model predicts the
RR intervals with an error of less than 6% for an 80-beat sequence. From a
physiological point of view, the results imply that the interaction between the
two pacemakers in the heart is fairly weak, and hence the parasystole observed

systems S1, S2, relative to S2 and a set O of bounded observables of S2, is
introduced in the spirit of classical examples of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and
Bohm. We restrict ourselves mostly to EPR states of finite norm. The main
results are contained in Theorem 3,4,5,6 in section III and imply that if the
EPR states of finite norm relative to (S2, O) exist, then the elements of O
have discrete probability distributions and the Von Neuman algebra generated by
O is essentially inbeddable inside S1 by an antiunitary map. The EPR states
then correspond to the different imbeddings and certain additional parameters,
and are explicitely given by formulae which generalize the famous example of
Bohm. If O generates all bounded observables, S2 must be of finite dimension
and can be imbedded inside S1 by an antiunitary map, and the EPR states
relative to S2 are then in canonical bijection with the different imbeddings of
S2 inside S1; moreover they are given by formulae which are exactly those of
the generalized Bohm states. The notion of EPR states of infinite norm is also
explored and it is shown that the original state of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen can
be realized as a renormalized limit of EPR states of finite quantum systems
considered by Weyl, Schwinger and many others. Finally, a family of states of
infinite norm generalizing the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen example is explicitly

show that any mixed state quantum secret sharing scheme can be derived by
discarding a share from a pure state scheme, and that the size of each share in
a quantum secret sharing scheme must be at least as large as the size of the
secret. I show that the only constraints on the existence of quantum secret
sharing schemes with general access structures are monotonicity (if a set is
authorized, so are larger sets) and the no-cloning theorem. I also discuss some
aspects of sharing classical secrets using quantum states. In this situation,
the size of each share can sometimes be half the size of the classical secret.

A 32, 7489-7508 (1999)","10.1088/0305-4470/32/43/305",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the nonstationary solutions of Fokker-Planck equations associated to
either stationary or nonstationary quantum states. In particular we discuss the
stationary states of quantum systems with singular velocity fields. We
introduce a technique that allows to realize arbitrary evolutions ruled by
these equations, to account for controlled quantum transitions. The method is
illustrated by presenting the detailed treatment of the transition
probabilities and of the controlling time-dependent potentials associated to
the transitions between the stationary, the coherent, and the squeezed states
of the harmonic oscillator. Possible extensions to anharmonic systems and mixed
states are briefly discussed and assessed.

Exploiting the phenomenon of entanglement-catalyzed transformations between

analyzing this, I consider the independently interesting problem of the best
possible approximation to a given pure entangled state realizable using local
actions and classical communication by parties sharing a different entangled
state.
