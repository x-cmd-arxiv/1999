is periodically lensed and Doppler shifted. If the spots occupy a narrow range
of radii, a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) will result. I calculate the QPO
frequency assuming that the spots appear near r_max - the radius of the maximal
proper radiation flux from the disk. The calculated frequency depends on the
black hole mass and spin. For the microquasar GRO J1655-40, the black hole mass
is known and a 300 Hz QPO was observed. The inferred black hole spin is about
60% of the maximal. The orbit precession frequency at r_max is 20Hz, this QPO
was also observed in GRO J1655-40. An approximate formula for r_max is given.

theoretical predictions of planetary nebula abundances from a grid of

this level of consistency between observation and theory enhances the validity
of published intermediate-mass stellar yields of carbon and nitrogen in the

present H-alpha velocities within NGC 1427A, obtained through long-slit
spectroscopy at seven different positions, chosen to fall on the brightest HII
regions of the galaxy. Due to its location very near the center of the cluster
this object is an excellent candidate to study the effects that the cluster
environment has on gas-rich galaxies embedded in it. The rotation of NGC 1427A
is modeled in two different ways. The global ionized gas kinematics is
reasonably well described by solid-body rotation, although on small scales it
shows a chaotic behaviour. In this simple model, the collision with a smaller
member of the cluster as being responsible for the peculiar morphology of NGC
1427A is very unlikely, since the only candidate intruder falls smoothly into
the general velocity pattern of the main galaxy. In a more elaborate model, for
which we obtain a better solution, this object does not lie in the same plane
of NGC 1427A, in which case we identify it as a satellite bound to the galaxy.
These results are discussed in the context of a normal irregular versus one
interacting with some external agent. Based on several arguments and
quantitative estimates, we argue that the passage through the hot intracluster
gas of the Fornax cluster is a very likely scenario to explain the
morphological properties of NGC 1427A.

model is presented. The disk model uses the observed stratifications for the
gas density and gravitational acceleration at the solar neighborhood and, in
this sense, it can be called a realistic model. The distribution of the total
gas pressure is defined by these observed stratifications, and the gaseous disk
is assumed isothermal. The initial magnetic field is taken parallel to the
disk, with a midplane value of 5 $\mu$G, and its stratification along the
z-axis is derived from the condition of magnetohydrostatic equilibrium in an
isothermal atmosphere. The resulting isothermal sound speed is $\sim 8.4$ km
s$^{-1}$, similar to the velocity dispersion of the main gas components within
1.5 kpc from midplane. The thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio decreases with
$[z]$ and the warm model is Parker unstable. The dispersion relations show that
the fastest growing mode has a wavelength of about 3 kpc, for both symmetric
and antisymmetric perturbations, and the corresponding growth time scales are
of about $3\times 10^7$ years. The structure of the final equilibrium stage is
also derived, and we find that the midplane antisymmetric (MA) mode gathers
more gas in the magnetic valleys. The resulting MA gas condensations have
larger densities, and the column density enhancement is a factor of about 3
larger than the value of the initial stage. The unstable wavelengths and growth
times for the multi-component disk model are substantially larger than those of
a thin disk model, and some of the implications of these results are discussed.

the fluxes obtained by the two instruments is generally very good; the largest
discrepancies are probably due to source variability. Our sample of oxygen-rich
AGB stars exhibits a wealth of spectral features due to crystalline silicates

qualitative overview of all features due to crystalline silicates and water ice

latter has to be physically justified {\it and} should not contradict
observational constraints. We propose two ways of coarse graining for which the
fixed temporal phase of each Fourier mode of the GW background still remains
observable: one based on quantum entanglement, and another one following from
the presence of a secondary GW background. The proposals are shown to be
mutually consistent. They lead to the result that the entropy of the primordial
GW background is significantly smaller than it was thought earlier. The
difference can be ascribed to the information about the regular (inflationary)
initial state of the Universe which is stored in this background and which
reveals itself, in particular, in the appearance of primordial peaks (acoustic
peaks in the case of scalar perturbations) in the multipole spectra of the CMB
temperature anisotropy and polarization.

differs by two standard deviations from the naive prediction of perturbative

exclusive two-body decay modes, and the corresponding experimental data
confirms the puzzles in

also show that the recent new results from the BES experiment provide crucial

of the canonical variables transform nontrivially only under the action of an
Abelian subgroup of the gauge transformations). At finite volume, a discrete
spectrum of the light-front Hamiltonian $P_+$ is obtained in the sector of
vanishing $P_-$. We obtain, therefore, a quantized form of the classical
solutions previously known as non-Abelian plane waves. Then, considering the
infinite volume limit, we find that the presence of the mass gap depends on the
way the infinite volume limit is taken, which may suggest the presence of
different ``phases'' of the infinite volume theory. We also check that the

latter is taken in the covariant gauges.

generalises Freed's definition of (affine) special K\""ahler manifolds. We also
define projective versions of all these geometries. Our main result is an
extrinsic realisation of all simply connected (affine or projective) special
complex, symplectic and K\""ahler manifolds. We prove that the above three types
of special geometry are completely solvable, in the sense that they are locally
defined by free holomorphic data. In fact, any special complex manifold is
locally realised as the image of a holomorphic 1-form \alpha : C^n \to T^* C^n.
Such a realisation induces a canonical \nabla-parallel symplectic structure on
M and any special symplectic manifold is locally obtained this way. Special
K\""ahler manifolds are realised as complex Lagrangian submanifolds and
correspond to closed forms \alpha. Finally, we discuss the natural geometric
structures on the cotangent bundle of a special symplectic manifold, which
generalise the hyper-K\""ahler structure on the cotangent bundle of a special
K\""ahler manifold.

characterize and study all Einstein metrics which are pointwise projective to
the given one. By definition, two metrics are said to be pointwise projectively
related if they have the same geodesics as point sets. This is closely related
to Hilbert's Fourth Problem. In this paper, we show that pointwise projectively
related Einstein metrics satisfy a simple equation along geodesics. In
particular, we prove the following rigidity theorem: if two pointwise
projectively related Einstein metrics are complete with negative Einstein
constants, then one is a multiple of another.
  A Riemann metric has two features: length and angle, while a Finsler metric
has only one feature: length. In projective metric geometry, the second feature
of Riemann metrics is generally not used. Thus, we do not restrict our
attention to Riemannian metrics. Our method is ``Finslerian''.

  first author, accepted for publication in Journal Physics A",,"10.1088/0305-4470/32/49/311",,"quant-ph",,"  Here we consider the Husimi function P for the squeezed states and calculate
the marginal and correlation distribution functions when P is projected onto
the photon number states. According to the value of the squeezing parameter one
verifies the occurence of oscillations and beats as already appointed in the
literature. We verify that these phenomena are entirely contained in the
correlation function. In particular, we show that since Husimi and its marginal
distribution functions satisfy partial differential equations where the squeeze
parameter plays the role of time, the solutions (the squeezed functions
obtained from initial unsqueezed functions) can be expressed by means of
kernels responsible for the propagation of squeezing. From the calculational
point of view, this method presents advantages for calculating the marginal
distribution functions (compared to a direct integration over one of the two
phase-space variables of P) since one can use the symmetry properties of the
differential equations.

A 63, 033812 (2001)","10.1103/PhysRevA.63.033812",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the use of detection devices in entanglement-based state
preparation. In particular we consider optical detection devices such as
single-photon sensitivity detectors, single-photon resolution detectors and
detector cascades (with an emphasis on the performance of realistic detectors).
We develop an extensive theory for the use of these devices. In
entanglement-based state preparation we perform measurements on subsystems, and
we therefore need precise bounds on the distinguishability of these
measurements (this is fundamentally different from, e.g., tomography, where an
ensemble of identical states is used to determine probability distributions,
etc.). To this end, we introduce the confidence of preparation, which may also
be used to quantify the performance of detection devices in entanglement-based
preparation. We give a general expression for detector cascades of arbitrary
size for the detection up to two photons. We show that, contrary to the general
belief, cascading does not give a practical advantage over detectors with
single-photon resolution in entanglement-based state preparation.

feasibility of the measurement is studied on the basis of Monte-Carlo
simulations. We also provide an application of this method in tomographic
testing of the GHZ state.
