  in press",,"10.1086/301207",,"astro-ph",,"  Neptune's largest satellite, Triton, is one of the most fascinating and
enigmatic bodies in the solar system. Among its numerous interesting traits,
Triton appears to have far fewer craters than would be expected if its surface
was primordial. Here we combine the best available crater count data for Triton
with improved estimates of impact rates by including the Kuiper Belt as a
source of impactors. We find that the population of impactors creating the
smallest observed craters on Triton must be sub-km in scale, and that this
small-impactor population can be best fit by a differential power-law size
index near -3. Such results provide interesting, indirect probes of the unseen
small body population of the Kuiper Belt. Based on the modern, Kuiper Belt and
Oort Cloud impactor flux estimates, we also recalculate estimated ages for
several regions of Triton's surface imaged by Voyager 2, and find that Triton
was probably active on a time scale no greater than 0.1-0.3 Gyr ago (indicating
Triton was still active after some 90% to 98% of the age of the solar system),
and perhaps even more recently. The time-averaged volumetric resurfacing rate
on Triton implied by these results, 0.01 km$^3$ yr$^{-1}$ or more, is likely
second only to Io and Europa in the outer solar system, and is within an order
of magnitude of estimates for Venus and for the Earth's intraplate zones. This
finding indicates that Triton likely remains a highly geologically active world
at present, some 4.5 Gyr after its formation. We briefly speculate on how such
a situation might obtain.

dimensionality is reduced from three to two. Below a critical excitation
strength, a gas-cluster phase occurs, and the velocity distribution becomes
bimodal. In this phase, the system consists of clusters of immobile particles
arranged in close-packed hexagonal arrays, and gas particles whose energy
equals the first excited state of an isolated particle on a vibrated plate.

for a given market the peak amplitude is a linear function of the logarithm of

  $ A=a\ln p_1 +b $; the values of the parameter a turn out to be relatively

supersymmetric standard Model (NMSSM) is investigated. It is found that the
spontaneous violation of the CP symmetry can occur in the Higgs sector of the
NMSSM for a wide region of the parameter space of the model, at the 1-loop
level where the radiative corrections due to the top quark and scalar-top quark
loops are found to generate the scalar-pseudoscalar mixings between the two
Higgs doublets of the NMSSM. In our model, we assume that the masses of the
left-handed and the right-handed scalar-top quarks are not degenerate. And we
investigate our model anaytically: We derive analytical formulae of the 1-loop
mass matrix for the neutral Higgs bosons. We calculate the upper bound on the
lightest neutral Higgs boson mass under the assumption. It is found to be about
140 GeV for our choice of parameter values in the presence of the spontaneous
violation of the CP symmetry in the NMSSM. Thus, the possibility of the
spontaneous violation of the CP symmetry is not completely ruled out in the
Higgs sector of the NMSSM if the masses of the left-handed and the right-handed
scalar-top quarks are not degenerate. Further, the phenomenology of the
$K$-${\bar K}$ mixing within the context of our model is studied. The lower
bound on CP violating phase in the $K$-${\bar K}$ mixing is found to increase
if either $\tan\beta$ decreases or $A_t$ increases.
