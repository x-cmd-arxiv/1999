  dropped, discussion of the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation for
  clump giants shortened and made more qualitative, results basically unchanged",,"10.1086/312426",,"astro-ph",,"  I demonstrate that the two unexpected results in the local Universe: 1)
anomalous intrinsic (V-I)_0 colors of the clump giants and RR Lyrae stars in
the Galactic center, and 2) very short distances to the Magellanic Clouds (LMC,
SMC) as inferred from clump giants, are connected with each other. The (V-I)_0
anomaly is partially resolved by using the photometry from the phase-II of the
Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) rather than phase-I. The need
for V- or I-magnitude-based change in the bulge (V-I)_0 is one option to
explain the remaining color discrepancy. Such change may originate in a
coefficient of selective extinction A_V/E(V-I) smaller than typically assumed.
Application of the (V-I)_0 correction (independent of its source) doubles the
slope of the absolute magnitude - metallicity relation for clump giants, so
that M_I(RC) = -0.23 + 0.19[Fe/H]. Consequently, the estimates of the clump
distances to the LMC and SMC are affected. Udalski's (1998c) distance modulus
of mu_{LMC} = 18.18 +/- 0.06 increases to mu_{LMC} = 18.27 +/- 0.07. The
distance modulus to the SMC increases by 0.12 to mu_{SMC} = 18.77 +/- 0.08. I
argue that a more comprehensive assessment of the metallicity effect on M_I(RC)
is needed.

the exploding star can provide enough soft photons for radiative drag to be

i.e. the overall energetics, the peak frequency of the spectrum and the fast
variability, with an efficiency which can exceed 50%. In this scenario there is
no need for particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks.
Furthermore, though Poynting flux may be important in accelerating the outflow,
no magnetic field is required in the gamma-ray production. The drag also
naturally limits the relativistic expansion of the fireball to Gamma < 10^4.

developed technique of difference image analysis (DIA) is adopted by several
gravitational microlensing experiment groups. However, the principal problem of
the DIA method is that, by its nature, it has difficulties in measuring the
baseline flux $F_0$ of a source star, causing degeneracy problem in determining
the lensing parameters of an event. Therefore, it is often believed that the
DIA method is not as powerful as the classical method based on the PSF
photometry in determining the Einstein time scales $t_{\rm E}$ of events.
  In this paper, we demonstrate that the degeneracy problem in microlensing
events detectable from the searches by using the DIA method will not be as
serious as it is often worried about. This is because a substantial fraction of
events will be high amplification events for which the deviations of the
amplification curves constructed with the wrong baseline fluxes from their
corresponding best-fit standard amplification curves will be considerable even
for a small amount of the fractional baseline flux deviation $\Delta F_0/F_0$.
With a model luminosity function of source stars and under realistic
observational conditions, we find that $\sim 30%$ of detectable Galactic bulge
events are expected to have high amplifications and their baseline fluxes can
be determined with uncertainties $\Delta F_0/F_0\leq 0.5$.

nearly impossible to detect directly due to instrumental limitations. However,
in rotating galaxies, if the inflowing gas conserves angular momentum, it will
eventually form a disk. The X-ray signature of this phenomenon is a flattening
of the X-ray isophotes in the inner 1-10 kpc region. This effect is observable,
so we have searched for it in X-ray observations of six rotating and
non-rotating early-type galaxies, obtained mainly with the ROSAT PSPC and HRI
imagers. The ellipticities of the X-ray emission never increase toward the
central region, nor are the X-ray ellipticities significantly greater than the
ellipticities for the optical stellar emission. Central ellipticities in excess
of 0.5 were expected in rotating ellipticals whereas values of 0-0.2 are
measured. The failure to detect the expected signature requires a modification
to the standard cooling flow picture, possibly including partial galactic
winds, rapid mass drop-out, or turbulent redistribution of angular momentum.

polymers (e.g. DNA) represent an intermediate case between flexible polymers
and stiff, rod-like ones, whose association with small molecules was previously
studied. The chains are not flexible enough to actively participate in the
self-assembly, yet their fluctuations induce long-range attractive interactions
between bound molecules. In cases where the binding significantly affects the
local chain stiffness, those interactions lead to a very sharp, cooperative
association. This scenario is of relevance to the association of DNA with
surfactants and compact proteins such as RecA. External tension exerted on the

$\cp$. In both cases $M$ carries a family of symplectic forms $\om_\la$, where
$\la > -1$ determines the cohomology class $[\om_\la]$. This paper calculates
the rational (co)homology of the group $G_\la$ of symplectomorphisms of
$(M,\om_\la)$ as well as the rational homotopy type of its classifying space
$BG_\la$. It turns out that each group $G_\la$ contains a finite collection
$K_k, k = 0,...,\ell = \ell(\la)$, of finite dimensional Lie subgroups that
generate its homotopy. We show that these subgroups ""asymptotically commute"",
i.e. all the higher Whitehead products that they generate vanish as $\la\to
\infty$. However, for each fixed $\la$ there is essentially one nonvanishing
product that gives rise to a ""jumping generator"" $w_\la$ in $H^*(G_\la)$ and to
a single relation in the rational cohomology ring $H^*(BG_\la)$. An analog of
this generator $w_\la$ was also seen by Kronheimer in his study of families of
symplectic forms on 4-manifolds using Seiberg--Witten theory. Our methods
involve a close study of the space of $\om_\la$-compatible almost complex
structures on $M$.

quartics lying on a smooth cubic threefold are studied. It is proved that their
generic fiber is the 5-dimensional projective space for quintics, and a smooth
3-dimensional variety birational to the cubic itself for quartics. The paper is
a continuation of the recent work of Markushevich-Tikhomirov, who showed that
the first Abel-Jacobi map factors through the moduli component of stable rank 2
vector bundles on the cubic threefold with Chern numbers $c_1=0, c_2=2$
obtained by Serre's construction from elliptic quintics, and that the
factorizing map from the moduli space to the intermediate Jacobian is \'etale.
The above result implies that the degree of the \'etale map is 1, hence the
moduli component of vector bundles is birational to the intermediate Jacobian.
As an applicaton, it is shown that the generic fiber of the period map of Fano
varieties of degree 14 is birational to the intermediate Jacobian of the
associated cubic threefold.
