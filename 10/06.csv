regions of the nearby universe. We make a 5/h Mpc-smoothed map of the galaxy
density throughout the Center for Astrophysics Redshift Survey (CfA2) to
identify galaxies within three prominent nearby ``voids'' with diameter >30/h
Mpc. We augment the CfA2 void galaxy sample with fainter galaxies found in the
same regions from the deeper Century and 15R Redshift Surveys. We obtain B and
R CCD images and high-S/N longslit spectra for the resulting sample of 149 void
galaxies, and also for 131 galaxies on the periphery of these voids.
  Here we describe the photometry for the sample, including B isophotal
magnitudes and B-R colors. For the 149 galaxies which lie in regions below the
mean survey density, the luminosity functions in B and R are well-fit by
Schechter functions with respective parameters (alpha_B = -0.5 +/- 0.3, B_* =
-18.9 +/- 0.2) and (alpha_R = -0.9 +/- 0.3, R_* = -20.4 +/- 0.3). The B
luminosity function (LF) is consistent with typical survey LFs (e.g., the
Southern Sky Redshift Survey), and the R LF is consistent with the Century
Survey. The B and R LFs of 131 galaxies in the ``void periphery'', regions
between the mean density and twice the mean, have similar Schechter parameters.
The CfA2 LF is inconsistent with both samples at 3.5-sigma.
  When we narrow our analysis to the 46 galaxies in regions below half the mean
density, the LF is steeper: alpha = -1.4 +/- 0.5. The typical survey LFs are
inconsistent with this subsample at 2-sigma. The B-R color distribution of
galaxies in the lowest-density regions is also shifted significantly (3-sigma)
blue-ward of the higher density samples. The most luminous red galaxies (R <
-21) are absent from the lowest density regions at 2.5-sigma.

  galaxy merging?","13 pages, 12 figures, to appear in MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The group of galaxies RXJ1340.6+4018 has approximately the same bolometric
X-ray luminosity as other bright galaxy groups and poor clusters such as the
Virgo cluster. However, 70% of the optical luminosity of the group comes from a
dominant giant elliptical galaxy, compared to 5% from M87 in Virgo. The second
brightest galaxy in RXJ1340.6+4018 is a factor of 10 fainter (2.5 mag) than the
dominant elliptical, and the galaxy luminosity function has a gap at about L*.
  We interpret the properties of the system as a result of galaxy merging
within a galaxy group. We find that the central galaxy lies on the fundamental
plane of ellipticals, has an undisturbed, non-cD morphology, and has no
spectral features indicative of recent star formation, suggesting that the last
major merger occurred >4 Gyr ago. The deviation of the system from the cluster
Lx-T relation in the opposite sense to most groups may be due to an early epoch
of formation of the group or due to a strong cooling flow.
  The unusual elongation of the X-ray isophotes and the similarity between the
X-ray and optical ellipticities at large radii (~230 kpc) suggest that both the
X-ray gas and the outermost stars of the dominant galaxy are responding to an
elongated dark matter distribution. RXJ1340.6+4018 may be part of a filamentary
structure related to infall in the outskirts of the cluster A1774.

light of the galaxies. We have found that a substantial fraction of such
galaxies (>50%) show extensive webs of dust-bearing clouds to heights z>2 kpc.
Extraplanar dust in galaxies is statistically correlated with extraplanar
diffuse ionized gas, though there is no evidence for a direct, physical
relationship between these two phases of the high-z interstellar medium. The
dense high-z clouds individually have masses estimated to be >10^5} to 10^6

the clouds seen in our images may represent the dense phase of a multiphase ISM

distribution in spiral galaxies. I discuss the effects such high-z dust can
have on quantitative measures of the vertical structure of stars and ionized

constant problem, one in which a large (as opposed to a small) cosmological
constant $\Lambda$ can be made compatible with observation. We trace the origin
of the cosmological constant problem to the assumption that the local
gravitational Newton constant $G$ (as measured in a Cavendish experiment) sets
the scale for global cosmology. And then we show that once this assumption is
relaxed, the very same cosmic acceleration which has served to make the
cosmological constant problem so very severe can instead then serve to provide
us with its potential resolution. In particular, we present an alternate
cosmology, one based on conformal gravity, a theory whose effective
cosmological $G_{eff}$ not only differs from the Cavendish one by being
altogether smaller than it, but, by even being explicitly negative, naturally
leads to cosmological repulsion. We show in the conformal theory, that once
given only that the sign of $\Lambda$ is specifically the negative one
associated with spontaneous scale symmetry breaking, then, that alone, no
matter how big $\Lambda$ might actually be in magnitude, is sufficient to not
only make the actually measurable contribution $8\pi G_{eff}
\Lambda/3cH^2(t_0)$ of $\Lambda$ to current era cosmology naturally be of order
one today, but to even do so in a way which is fully compatible with the recent

the morphological mix and the EW(H-alpha) distribution of galaxies at modest
underdensites are indistinguishable from our control sample at modest
overdensities (early-type and absorption-line fractions both ~35%). At the
lowest densities: the absorption-line fraction drops to 15%; more galaxies have
active star formation; and there are more irregular and peculiar morphologies.
  Our magnitude-limited redshift survey of 250 fainter projected companions
reveals that the void galaxies are no less likely to have a neighbor in
redshift space. However, the typical velocity separation of close pairs drops
sharply at densities below half the mean, from >200 km/s to ~100 km/s. The
EW(H-alpha) distribution for galaxies lacking nearby companions varies little
with density, while galaxies with nearby companions are much more likely to
have strong current star formation (H-alpha linewidths >20 \AA) in the voids.
  These results and the luminosity- and color-density relations of this sample
(astro-ph/9910073) suggest that the formation and evolution of field galaxies
are only sensitive to large-scale underdensity below a threshold of roughly
half the mean density. The differences in galaxy properties at the lower
densities may be explained by: 1) a relative scarcity of the small-scale
primordial density enhancements needed to form massive early-type/absorption-
line galaxies; 2) more effective galaxy encounters due to the lower velocity
dispersion on small scales; and 3) more gas and dust available for triggered
star formation, presuming that luminous void galaxies formed more recently.

importance of local conditions in regulating star formation from evidence such
as massive stars inside ionized shells, compact HII regions surrounding aging

by HI shells is supported by observations of progenitor populations as well as
secondary sites of star formation associated with their dense rims. Analysis of
the energy available from massive stars inside HI shells indicates energy
deposited into the ISM from supernovae and stellar winds is sufficient to
account for the HI morphology. Ages of individual star forming regions are
derived using B, H-alpha, and FUV photometry. The distribution of ages is
reconciled with the HI morphology, showing a clear preference of young regions
for areas of dense HI and old regions for HI voids. Global kinematical
properties may also play a role in the star formation process since differences
in the rotation characteristics of the neutral gas disk correlate with

emission line measurements are available for 216 galaxies, allowing us to
address issues of reddening and metallicity. The UV and Halpha luminosity
functions strengthen our earlier assertions that the local volume-averaged star
formation rate is higher than indicated from earlier surveys. Moreover,
internally within our sample, we do not find a steep rise in the UV luminosity
density with redshift over 0<z<0.4. Our data is more consistent with a modest
evolutionary trend as suggested by recent redshift survey results. We find no
evidence for a significant number of AGN in our sample. We find the UV flux
indicates a consistently higher mean star formation rate than that implied by
the Halpha luminosity for typical constant or declining star formation
histories. Following Glazebrook et al. (1999), we interpret this discrepancy in
terms of a starburst model for our UV-luminous sources. Whilst we can explain
most of our observations in this way, there remains a small population with

  objects","19 pages, Astronomy & Astrophysics, in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the properties of the host galaxies of X-ray selected (high
frequency peaked) BL Lac objects using a large and homogeneous data set of high
spatial resolution R-band observations of 52 BL Lacs in the EMSS and Slew
samples. The redshift distribution of the BL Lacs ranges from z = 0.04 to
z>0.7, with average and median redshifts z = 0.26 and z = 0.24, respectively.
Eight objects are at unknown redshift.
  We are able to resolve 45 objects out of the 52 BL Lacs. For all the
well-resolved sources, we find the host to be a luminous elliptical galaxy. In
a few cases a disk is not ruled out but an elliptical model is still preferred.
  The average absolute magnitude of the host galaxies is <M_R(host)> =
-23.9+-0.6, while the average scale length of the host is <R(e)> = 9+-5 kpc.
There is no difference in the host properties between the EMSS and Slew
samples. We find a good agreement between the results derived by the surveys of
Wurtz et al. (ground-based data) and Urry et al. (HST data), and by our new
deeper imaging. The average luminosity of the BL Lac hosts is between those of
F-R I and F-R II radio galaxies in Govoni et al., supporting the idea that both
radio galaxy types could contribute to the parent population. The BL Lac hosts
follow the F-P relation for giant ellipticals and exhibit a modest luminosity
evolution with redshift. Finally, we find a slight correlation between the
nuclear and host luminosity and a bimodal distribution in the nuclear/host
luminosity ratio.

1990 with ART-P on Granat. Three target-of-opportunity observations in 1998 and
1999, with the narrow-field instruments on BeppoSAX and the PCA, revealed one
sharp drop in the flux which we identify as an eclipse of the compact X-ray
source by the companion star. A detailed analysis of WFC data identifies
further eclipses and we measure the orbital period at 12.360+/-0.009 hr. This
is consistent with an identification as a low-mass X-ray binary, as suggested
already by the association with a globular cluster. The eclipse duration is
0.72+/-0.06 hr. This implies that the inclination angle is larger than 74 deg.
The 0.1-200 keV unabsorbed peak luminosity is 7X10^36 erg/s. The nature of the

detected by some sensitive intrument on board a satellite, provided that the
nova is close enough and that it is observed at the right moment. The detection
of this emission, which is a challenge for the now available and for the future

particle is studied taking into account its interactions with the medium. It is
assumed that this interaction results in the appearance of special virtual
excitations, called ""inertons,"" in the vacuum medium in the surroundings of the
canonical particle. The solution of the equation of motion shows that a cloud
of inertons oscillates around the particle with amplitude $\Lambda=\lambda
v/c$, where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, v is the initial velocity
of the particle, and c is the initial velocity of the inertons (velocity of
light). This oscillating nature of motion is also applied to the particle, and
the de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$ becomes the amplitude of spacial
oscillations. The oscillation frequency $\nu$ is given by the relation
$E=h\nu$. The connection of the present model with orthodox nonrelativistic
wave mechanics is analyzed.

communication (LQ+CC). Evidence for this undistillability is provided by the
result that, for certain states in this family, we cannot extract entanglement
from any arbitrarily large number of copies of $\rho_{bc}$ using a projection
on $2\otimes 2$. These states are canonical NPT states in the sense that any
bipartite mixed state in any dimension with NPT can be reduced by LQ+CC
operations to an NPT state of the $\rho_{bc}$ form. We show that the main
question about the distillability of mixed states can be formulated as an open
mathematical question about the properties of composed positive linear maps.
