when the hardness of the source spectrum was changing on the time scales from
few seconds up to 1000 seconds. The quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) with the
frequency varying between ~ 1 and 12 Hz are associated with the episodes of
harder source spectrum. In each observation we found tight correlation between
the duration of the hard episode and the characteristic QPO frequency. For a
half of the observations this correlation matches the relation between the
viscous time scale and the Keplerian frequency, when both quantities are
evaluated for various radii in the radiation pressure dominated accretion disk.
Assuming that the QPO frequency is proportional to the Keplerian frequency at
the boundary between an optically thick accretion disk and a hot comptonization
region, the changes of the QPO frequency can then be understood as due to
variations of this boundary position on the viscous time scales.

density is shaped by the wind of an evolved massive star. These two models
predict divergent behavior for the radio afterglow, and therefore, radio
observations are capable, in principle, of discriminating between the two. We
show that a wind model describes the subsequent evolution of the radio

energy in the form of gravitational radiation. However, binary evolution models
predict merger rates too low to be of observational interest. In this paper we
explore the possibility that black holes become members of close binaries via
dynamical interactions with other stars in dense stellar systems. In star
clusters, black holes become the most massive objects within a few tens of
millions of years; dynamical relaxation then causes them to sink to the cluster
core, where they form binaries. These black-hole binaries become more tightly
bound by superelastic encounters with other cluster members, and are ultimately
ejected from the cluster. The majority of escaping black-hole binaries have
orbital periods short enough and eccentricities high enough that the emission
of gravitational radiation causes them to coalesce within a few billion years.
We predict a black-hole merger rate of about $1.6 \times 10^{-7}$ per year per
cubic megaparsec, implying gravity wave detection rates substantially greater
than the corresponding rates from neutron star mergers. For the first
generation Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO-I), we
expect about one detection during the first two years of operation. For its
successor LIGO-II, the rate rises to roughly one detection per day. The
uncertainties in these numbers are large. Event rates may drop by about an
order of magnitude if the most massive clusters eject their black hole binaries
early in their evolution.

fluence or energy distribution of bursts is consistent with a power law of

the Gutenberg-Richter Law for earthquakes, and gives evidence for
self-organized criticality in SGRs. The distribution of time intervals between
successive bursts from SGR 1900+14 is consistent with a log-normal
distribution. There is no correlation between burst intensity and the waiting
times till the next burst, but there is some evidence for a correlation between
burst intensity and the time elapsed since the previous burst. We also find a
correlation between the duration and the energy of the bursts, but with
significant scatter. In all these statistical properties, SGR bursts resemble
earthquakes and solar flares more closely than they resemble any known

the bright ionization front at the head facing the central cluster and a
fainter ionization front around the tail pointing away from the cluster.
Typical sizes are 6,000 A.U. x 20,000 A.U. The nebulae share the overall
morphology of the proplyds (``PROto PLanetarY DiskS'') in Orion, but are 20 to
30 times larger in size. Additional faint filaments located between the nebulae

that the physical structure of both types of objects might be the same. We

demonstrated that (1) our longitudinal magnetogram matches very well the
corresponding Mitaka's magnetogram to the extent that the maximum correlation
yields r=0.962 between our re-scaled longitudinal magnetogram and the Mitaka's
magnetogram; (2) according to a comparison of our magnetograms of AR 8422 with
those taken at Mitaka solar observatory their longitudinal fields are very
similar to each other while transverse fields are a little different possibly
due to large noise level; (3) main features seen by our longitudinal
magnetograms of AR 8422 and AR 8419 and the corresponding Kitt Peak
magnetograms are very similar to each other; (4) time series of our vector
magnetograms and H-alpha observations of AR 8419 during its flaring (M3.1/1B)
activity show that the filament eruption followed the sheared inversion line of
the quadrupolar configuration of sunspots, indicating that the flare should be
associated with the quadrupolar field configuration and its interaction with
new filament eruption. Finally, it may be concluded that the Solar Flare
Telescope at BOAO works normally and it is ready to do numerous observational
and theoretical works associated with solar activities such as flares.

we shall show, as has often been suspected, that the opening angle of the cone
depends on the luminosity of the central source, with higher luminosities
corresponding to larger opening angles. This conclusion depends only on the
assumption that the width of the broad emission lines at a given luminosity is
a measure of inclination angle, an assumption that is supported by observation
in radio-loud systems. On the other hand we show that the scatter in X-ray
spectral index is not primarily an effect of viewing angle, in contrast to what
might be expected if the scatter on the spectral index versus luminosity
relation were a consequence of absorption in the obscuring material. The
observed correlation between linewidth and spectral index appears to be a
further consequence of the dependence of opening angle on luminosity.

frequency nu_br) and the spectral parameters in the low spectral state. The
amplitude of reflection increases and the spectrum of primary radiation
steepens as the noise frequency increases (nu_br changes by a factor of ~15 in
our sample). This can be understood assuming that increase of the noise
frequency is associated with the shift of the inner boundary of the optically
thick accretion disk towards the compact object. The related increase of the
solid angle, subtended by the disk, and of the influx of the soft photons to
the Comptonization region lead to an increase of the amount of reflection and
steepening of the Comptonized spectrum. The correlation between the slope of
primary radiation and the amplitude of reflection extends to the soft spectral
state. A similar correlation between reflection and slope was found for the
frequency resolved spectra in the 0.01-15 Hz frequency range. Such a
correlation could appear if the longer time scale variations are associated
with emission originating closer to the optically thick disk and, therefore,
having steeper Comptonized spectra with larger reflection.

obtain a total sample of ~2000 radial velocities. Using the 1440 galaxies of

profile in the central part of the Shapley Concentration; moreover we detected
another significant overdensity at ~30000 km/s (dubbed S300). We estimate the
total overdensity in galaxies, the mass and the dynamical state of these

distribution and the underlying matter. We find an indication that the value of
the bias between clusters and galaxies in the Shapley Concentration is higher
that that reported in literature, confirming the impression that this
supercluster is very rich in clusters. Finally, from the comparison with some

multidimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), having as a main built-in
condition the divergence-free constraint $\divb=0$ for the magnetic field
vector $\bb$, is proposed. The suggested procedure is based on {\em
consistency} arguments, by taking into account the specific operator structure
of MHD equations with respect to the reference Euler equations of gas-dynamics.
This approach leads in a natural way to a staggered representation of the $\bb$
field numerical data where the divergence-free condition in the cell-averaged
form, corresponding to second order accurate numerical derivatives, is exactly
fulfilled. To extend this property to higher order schemes, we then give
general prescriptions to satisfy a $(r+1)^{th}$ order accurate $\divb=0$
relation for any numerical $\bb$ field having a $r^{th}$ order interpolation
accuracy. Consistency arguments lead also to a proper formulation of the upwind
procedures needed to integrate the induction equations, assuring the exact
conservation in time of the divergence-free condition and the related
continuity properties for the $\bb$ vector components. As an application, a
third order code to simulate multidimensional MHD flows of astrophysical
interest is developed using ENO-based reconstruction algorithms. Several test
problems to illustrate and validate the proposed approach are finally
presented.

Goldstone mode carries only a fraction of the total optical spectral weight,
which is determined by the ratio of the amplitude of the two SDW's. In the
helicoidal phase, all the spectral weight is pushed up above the SDW gap. We
also point out similarities with phase modes in two-band or bilayer

fact that the non-trivial reality conditions of the Ashtekar framework reenter
the stage when imposing suitable boundary conditions on the fields and the
Lagrange multipliers.

explicitly, both, via the reduced phase space approach or along the lines of
the algebraic quantization programme. This model stands in close correspondence
to the frequently treated cylindrically symmetric waves. In contrast to other
models that have been looked at up to now in terms of the new variables the
reduced phase space is infinite dimensional while the scalar constraint is
genuinely bilinear in the momenta. The infinite number of Dirac observables can
be expressed in compact and explicit form in terms of the original phase space
variables. They turn out, as expected, to be non-local and form naturally a set
of countable cardinality.

ideas for, main problems of and techniques for the task of quantizing gravity
canonically. Since one of the major motivations to arrange for this meeting was
that it should serve as a beginner's introduction to canonical quantum gravity,
we regard it as important to demonstrate the usefulness of the formalism by
means of applying it to simplified models of quantum gravity, here formulated
in terms of Ashtekar's new variables. From the various, completely solvable,
models that have been discussed in the literature we choose those that we
consider as most suitable for our pedagogical reasons, namely 2+1 gravity and
the spherically symmetric model. The former model arises from a dimensional,
the latter from a Killing reduction of full 3+1 gravity. While 2+1 gravity is
usually treated in terms of closed topologies without boundary of the initial
data hypersurface, the toplogy for the spherically symmetric system is chosen
to be asymptotically flat. Finally, 2+1 gravity is more suitably quantized
using the loop representation while spherically symmetric gravity is easier to
quantize via the self-dual representation. Accordingly, both types of
reductions, both types of topologies and both types of representations that are
mainly employed in the literature in the context of the new variables come into
practice. What makes the discussion especially clear is the fact that for both
models the reduced phase space turns out to be finitely dimensional.

The dimension of the reduced phase space depends on the topology chosen, quite
similar to the case of pure (2+1) gravity. We also compare the reduced phase
space quantization to the algebraic quantization. Altogether, we observe that
the present model serves as an interesting testing ground for full (3+1)
gravity. We use the new canonical variables introduced by Ashtekar which

It is shown that in the Kerr background without horizon but with an inner
boundary a scalar field has complex-frequency modes and that, however, the
imaginary part of the complex frequency can be small enough compared with the
Hawking temperature if the inner boundary is sufficiently close to the horizon,
say at a proper altitude of Planck scale. Hence, the time scale of the
instability due to the complex frequencies is much longer than the relaxation
time scale of the thermal state with the Hawking temperature. Since ambient
fields should settle in the thermal state in the latter time scale, the
instability is not so catastrophic. Thus, the brick wall model is well defined
even in a rotating background if the inner boundary is sufficiently close to
the horizon.

the matrix element of Q_8 obtained without reference to the strange quark mass.
Since a reliable lattice determination of the matrix element of Q_6 is still
missing, the theoretical predictions for epsilon'/epsilon suffer from large
uncertainties. By evaluating this matrix element with the vacuum-saturation
approximation, we typically find as central value epsilon'/epsilon = (4 - 7) x
10^(-4). We conclude that the experimental data suggest large deviation of the
value of the matrix element of Q_6 from the vacuum-saturation approximation,
possibly due to penguin contractions.

cells. Specifically, the calcium concentration distribution is assumed to give
rise to a set of probabilities for the opening/closing of channels which
release calcium thereby changing those probabilities. We study this model in
one dimension, analytically in the mean-field limit of large number of channels
per site N, and numerically for small N. As the number of channels per site is
increased, the transition from a non-propagating region of activity to a
propagating one changes in nature from one described by directed percolation to
that of deterministic depinning in a spatially discrete system. Also, for a
small number of channels a propagating calcium wave can leave behind a novel
fluctuation-driven state, in a parameter range where the limiting deterministic
model exhibits only single pulse propagation.

model is proposed which approximates the peak by a half-ellipsoid atop a layer
of magnetic fluid. The resulting nonlinear equation for the height of the peak
leads to the correct subcritical character of the bifurcation for static
induction. For a time-dependent induction the effects of inertia and damping
are incorporated. The results of the model show qualitative agreement with the
experimental findings, as in the appearance of period doubling, trebling, and
higher multiples of the driving period. Furthermore a quantitative agreement is
also found for the parameter ranges of frequency and induction in which these
phenomena occur.

consisting of simplices is described. In the process of initialization, the
simplex-shaped cells divide into daughter subcells in such a way that: (a) cell
density is biggest in areas where integrand is peaked, (b) cells elongate
themselves along hyperspaces where integrand is enhanced/singular. The grid is
anisotropic, i.e. memory of the axes directions of the primary reference frame
is lost. In particular, the algorithm is capable of dealing with distributions
featuring strong correlation among variables (like ridge along diagonal). The
presented algorithm is complementary to others known and commonly used in the
Monte Carlo event generators. It is, in principle, more effective then any
other one for distributions with very complicated patterns of singularities -
the price to pay is that it is memory-hungry. It is therefore aimed at a small
number of integration dimensions (<10). It should be combined with other
methods for higher dimension. The source code in Fortran77 is available from

by a Wigner distribution function which is Gaussian in form is found to depend
only on the variance of the distribution function. We give a series of
inequalities, relating uncertainty to von Neumann entropy and linear entropy.
We analyze the conditions for purity of states and show that for a special
choice of the diffusion coefficients, the correlated coherent states (squeezed
coherent states) are the only states which remain pure all the time during the
evolution of the considered system. These states are also the most stable under
evolution in the presence of the environment and play an important role in the
description of environment induced decoherence.

Then, the hybrid systems approach, with the operator formulation of both

Schr\""odinger and Liouville dynamics, produces noncausal evolution when the
initial state of measured system and measuring apparatus is chosen to be as it
is demanded in discussions regarding the problem of measurement. Nonuniqueness
of possible realizations of transition from pure noncorrelated to mixed
correlated state is analyzed in details. It is concluded that collapse of state
is the only possible way of evolution of physical systems in this case.
