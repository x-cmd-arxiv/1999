unusual characteristics: extremely high energy output at radio and optical
wavelengths, and relativistic expansion of the outgoing shock. The X-ray

The bright cloud of interstellar gas and dust observed with ISO (Infrared Space

LBV star, and the progenitor of the soft gamma-ray repeater pulsar. The
presence of such a young star formation region is compatible with the current
interpretation of soft gamma-ray repeaters as young neutron stars. The SGR

the infrared luminous massive stars, since no flux variations in the

Because no lateral spreading of the blast-wave is assumed, the calculated
temporal breaks represent the sharpest breaks possible from collimated outflows
in a uniform surrounding medium. Absence of SSC hardenings in observed GRB
X-ray afterglows indicates magnetic field generation toward equipartition as
the blast wave evolves. EGRET detections of 100 MeV-GeV photons observed
promptly and 90 minutes after GRB 940217 are attributed to nonthermal
synchrotron radiation and SSC emission from a decelerating blast wave,
respectively. The SSC process will produce prompt TeV emission that could be
observed from GRBs with redshifts $z \lesssim 0.1$, provided $\gamma$-$\gamma$
opacity in the source is small. Measurements of the time dependence of the 100
MeV-GeV spectral indices with the planned {\it GLAST} mission will chart the
evolution of the SSC component and test the external shock scenario. Transient
optical and X-ray emissions from misaligned GRBs are generally much weaker than
on-axis emissions produced by dirty and clean fireballs that would themselves
not trigger a GRB detector; thus detection of long wavelength transients not
associated with GRBs will not unambiguously demonstrate GRB beaming.

evolution of an adiabatic relativistic fireball interacting with an ambient
uniform medium, both in the initial energy transfer stage and in its late
evolution. It is shown that the Blandford-McKee solution adequately describes
the evolution of the shocked shell quite early on and for as long as the
fireball material has relativistic temperatures. In the case where the reverse
shock is only mildly relativistic the shocked shell becomes cold almost
immediately and the evolution deviates from the Blandford-McKee solution. We
derive analytical expressions for the ejecta evolution in its cold regime. This
solution gives a good approximation to the numerical results. We estimate the
radiation from the fireball ejecta using the numerical hydrodynamic evolution
in both cases: cold and hot shells. Surprisingly, we find that both evolutions
give rather similar light curves, decaying approximately as $T^{-2}$ in the

If the galaxy population in MS1054-03 is typical for its redshift up to 50% of

However, symplectic integrators are often applied to systems in which

central mass. In this case, it is possible to create optimized symplectic
algorithms that require fewer substeps per timestep. This is achieved by only
considering error terms of order epsilon, and neglecting those of order
epsilon^2, epsilon^3 etc. Here we devise symplectic algorithms with 4 and 6

In our models we explore the role of ram pressure and cooling by holding the
wind speed constant and adjusting the ratio of the inflow mass flux to the wind

relatively strong winds can carve out wide, conical outflow cavities and that

of these extinctions is another unique aspect of this signature of dark matter.

of neurons in which every neuron has reciprocal connections to other members of

neurons, is not found in these CPGs. In this paper we investigate a possible
reason for this topological structure using the ability to perform a biological

composed of model neurons which exhibit regular membrane voltage oscillations,
open topologies are essentially as able to maximize this functionality as

chaotic membrane voltage oscillations, the functional criterion selects closed
topologies when the demands of the task are increased, and these are the
topologies observed in known CPG networks. As isolated neurons from

consists of one-dimensional (1D) edge-channels that arise from the confining

magnetic fields, E x B, cause electrons to drift parallel to the sample
boundary creating a chiral current that travels along the edge in only one
direction. Remarkably, in an ideal 2DES in the quantum Hall regime all current
flows along the edge$^{4-6}$. Quantization of the Hall resistance, $R_{xy}=
h/Ne^{2}$, arises from occupation of N 1D edge channels, each contributing a
conductance of $e^{2}/h^{7-11}$. To explore this unusual one-dimensional
property of an otherwise two-dimensional system, we have studied tunneling
between the edges of 2DESs in the regime of integer quantum Hall effect (QHE).
In the presence of an atomically precise, high-quality tunnel barrier, the
resultant interaction between the edge states leads to the formation of new
energy gaps and an intriguing dispersion relation for electrons traveling along
the barrier. The absence of tunneling features due to the electron spin and the
persistence of a conductance peak at zero bias are not consistent with a model

assumption of stationarity in the Bak-Sneppen model. Finally, we propose a
general definition of self-organised criticality which is in partial agreement
with other recent definitions.

contrast the two scenarios: (i) an order parameter phase difference of
$\theta=0$ across the interface, and (ii) a phase slip of $\theta=\pi$ across
the interface. We find resonant sub-gap structure in the density of states only
when there is a phase slip present. We show that the local s-wave and ``p-wave

profile and by the phase slip. The temperature dependence of the local p-wave
order parameter follows the underlying bulk $T_c$ for p-wave superconductivity
implying that this could be measured by a suitable tunneling experiment. We
also calculate the Josephson critical current as a function of the strength of
the insulating barrier at the interface.

new proton-proton parity violation experiments are presently either being

221 MeV and 450 MeV and at COSY (Forschungszentrum Juelich) in the multi-GeV
range. A new measurement of the parity-violating gamma ray asymmetry with a
ten-fold improvement in the accuracy over previous measurements is being
developed at LANSCE. These experiments are intended to provide stringent
constraints on the set of six effective weak meson-nucleon coupling constants,
which characterize the weak interaction between hadrons in the energy domain
where meson exchange models provide an appropriate description. The 221 MeV pp
experiment is unique in that it selects a single transition amplitude, 3P2 -
1D2, and consequently constrains the weak meson-nucleon coupling constant
h_rho^(pp). The n+p -> d+gamma experiment is mainly sensitive to the weak
pion-nucleon coupling constant f_pi. Together with the existing pp parity
violation experimental results one may be able to delineate the various weak
meson-nucleon coupling constants. The anomalous result obtained at 6 GeV/c on a

the mass conversion factor turns out to be large and comparable to the previous
NNLO contribution at a scale of 2 GeV --- the typical normalization scale
employed in lattice simulations. Thus, in order to get a precise prediction for
the MS-bar masses of the light quarks from lattice calculations the latter
should use a somewhat higher scale of around, say, 3 GeV where the (apparent)
convergence of the perturbative series for the mass conversion factor is
better.

opportunities for transition to a new vacuum state, so that existing
observations provide stringent bounds. We discuss in most detail the
possibility of producing a dangerous strangelet. We argue that four separate
requirements are necessary for this to occur: existence of large stable
strangelets, metastability of intermediate size strangelets, negative charge
for strangelets along the stability line, and production of intermediate size
strangelets in the heavy ion environment. We discuss both theoretical and
experimental reasons why each of these appears unlikely; in particular, we know
of no plausible suggestion for why the third or especially the fourth might be
true. Given minimal physical assumptions the continued existence of the Moon,

provides powerful empirical evidence against the possibility of dangerous

space-time) of two-point functions.
  For two-point functions we define the concept of projected function: it is
zero if any of times refers to the time before switching on the interaction,
otherwise it depends only on the relative coordinates. This definition includes
bare propagators, one-loop self-energies, etc. For the infinite-average-time
limit of the Wigner transforms of projected functions we define the analyticity
assumptions: (1) The function of energy is analytic above (below) the real
axis. (2) The function goes to zero as the absolute value of energy approaches
infinity in the upper (lower) semiplane.
  Without use of the gradient expansion, we obtain the convolution product of
projected functions. We sum the Schwinger-Dyson series in closed form. In the
calculation of the Keldysh component (both, resummed and single self-energy
insertion approximation) contributions appear which are not the Wigner
transforms of projected functions, signaling the limitations of the method.
  In the Feynman diagrams there is no explicit energy conservation at vertices,
there is an overall energy-smearing factor taking care of the uncertainty
relations.
  The relation between the theories with the Keldysh time path and with the
finite time path enables one to rederive the results, such as the cancellation
of pinching, collinear, and infrared singularities, hard thermal loop
resummation, etc.

(B)$ of an arbitrary symbolic or numeric bilinear form B. In particular, B may
have a non-trivial antisymmetric part. It is well known that the symmetric part
g of B determines a unique (up to an isomorphism) Clifford structure on
$\cl(B)$ while the antisymmetric part of B changes the multilinear structure of
$\cl(B).$ As an example, we verify Helmstetter's formula which relates Clifford
product in $\cl(g)$ to the Clifford product in $\cl(B).$ Experimentation with
Clifford algebras $\cl(B)$ of a general form~B is highly desirable for physical
reasons and can be easily done with {\sc CLIFFORD}. One such application
includes a derivation of a representation of Hecke algebras in ideals generated
by q-Young operators. Any element (multivector) of $\cl(B)$ is represented in
Maple as a multivariate Clifford polynomial in the Grassmann basis monomials
although other bases, such as the Clifford basis, may also be used. Using the
well-known isomorphism between simple Clifford algebras $\cl(Q)$ of a quadratic
form Q and matrix algebras through a faithful spinor representation, one can
translate standard matrix algebra problems into the Clifford algebra language.
We show how the Singular Value Decomposition of a matrix can be performed in a
Clifford algebra. Clifford algebras of a degenerate quadratic form provide a
convenient tool with which to study groups of rigid motions in robotics. With
the help from {\sc CLIFFORD} we can actually describe all elements of $\Pin(3)$
and $\Spin(3).$ Rotations in $\BR^3$ can then be generated by unit quaternions
realized as even elements in $\cl^{+}_{0,3}.$ Throughout this work all symbolic
computations are performed with {\sc CLIFFORD} and its extensions.

can be used to construct canonical variables leading to a different definition

derived, comprising an energy diffusion coefficient based on gyroresonant

spontaneous emission into occupied energy levels below the Fermi surface. We
demonstrate temperature dependent qualitative changes in the differential and

A 61, 062102 (2000)","10.1103/PhysRevA.61.062102",,"quant-ph",,"  We study violations of n particle Bell inequalities (as developed by Mermin
and Klyshko) under the assumption that suitable partial transposes of the
density operator are positive. If all transposes with respect to a partition of
the system into p subsystems are positive, the best upper bound on the
violation is 2^((n-p)/2). In particular, if the partial transposes with respect
to all subsystems are positive, the inequalities are satisfied. This is
supporting evidence for a recent conjecture by Peres that positivity of partial
transposes could be equivalent to existence of local classical models.

particular of the so-called Bell basis for this system, which have played an
important role in recent papers on entanglement of qubits. In particular, we
show which of these properties may be generalized to higher dimension. We give
a general construction for bases of maximally entangled vectors in any
dimension, but show that none of the properties related to complex conjugation
in Bell basis can be realized for higher dimensional analogs.
