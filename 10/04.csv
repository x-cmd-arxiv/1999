photometric `form' and indices of spectral-type, applicable to both nearby and
distant galaxies. Such a characterization provides insight on galaxy evolution
because there are physical connections between galaxies' stellar populations
and their light distribution. ``Normal'' galaxies' form-parameters
(surface-brightness, image concentration and asymmetry) correlate well with
spectral-index (color), which in turn correlates only weakly with scale (size
or luminosity). Deviations from these normal relations also offer clues to the
physical modes of galaxy formation and evolution. As an example, I contrast a
puzzling, distant population of compact, but luminous, blue, star-forming
galaxies to nearby samples. These distant sources appear to be associated with
the bulk of the luminosity increase since z<1. They have structural properties
comparable to low-redshift populations, and photometric properties within the
norm for nearby, actively star-forming galaxies. When combined, however, their
photometric and structural properties appear to be highly unusual.

Accepted by ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/312377",,"astro-ph gr-qc hep-ph",,"  We have made a quantitative calculation for the systematic evolution of
average extinction by interstellar dust in host galaxies of high-redshift Type
Ia supernovae, by using a realistic model of photometric and chemical evolution
of galaxies and supernova rate histories in various galaxy types. We find that
average B band extinction <A_B> at z \sim 0.5 is typically 0.1-0.2 mag larger
than present, under a natural assumption that dust optical depth is
proportional to gas column density and gas metallicity. This systematic
evolution causes average reddening with E(B-V) \sim 0.025-0.05 mag with the
standard extinction curve, and this is comparable with the observational
uncertainty of the reddening of high-redshift supernovae. Therefore, our result
does not contradict the observations showing no significant reddening in high-z
supernovae. However, the difference in apparent magnitude between an open
universe and a \Lambda-dominated flat universe is only \sim 0.2 mag at z \sim
0.5, and hence this systematic evolution of extinction should be taken into
account in a reliable measurement of cosmological parameters. Considering this
uncertainty, we show that it is difficult to discriminate between an open and
\Lambda-dominated flat cosmologies from the current data.

in synthetic calculations of their evolution. Recently, Herwig et al. (1998)

evolution differs appreciably from the simple linear Mc-L relation. In this
paper, we show that at least part of the luminosity evolution can be understood
as being the result of two well-known effects: the gradual approach to the
asymptotic behaviour that characterises the first thermal pulses, and the
chemical composition changes of the envelope. Both effects are already
implemented in the Mc-L relations used in synthetic models. Consequently, these
models are able to reproduce the behaviour of full calculations. Whether
additional effects, not yet taken into account, are present, can be decided
only through additional calculations and data. We also comment on the validity
of a linear Mc-L relation and its possible violation, as mentioned by Herwig et

a spacetime curvature. In the case of a self-coupling inflaton potential
$V(\phi)=\lambda \phi^4/4$, the dynamics of preheating changes by the effect of
the negative $\xi$. We find that the nonminimal coupling works in two ways.
  First, since the initial value of inflaton field for reheating becomes
smaller with the increase of $|\xi|$, the evolution of the inflaton quanta is
delayed for fixed $\lambda$. Second, the oscillation of the inflaton field is
modified and the nonadiabatic change around $\phi=0$ occurs significantly. That
makes the resonant band of the fluctuation field wider. Especially for strong
coupling regimes $|\xi| \gg 1$, the growth of the inflaton flutuation is
dominated by the resonance due to the nonminimal coupling, which leads to the
significant enhancement of low momentum modes. Although the final variance of
the inflaton fluctuation does notchange significantly compared with the
minimally coupled case, we have found that the energy transfer from the
homogeneous inflaton to created particles efficiently occurs for $\xi<-60$.

condensate for Nf= 0, 1 and 2 quark flavours. We use a simplified model: the
instantons are a (weighted) gas, the fermionic integrations are restricted to
the subspace spanned by the would-be zero-modes and only the dimensional and
chiral features of the Dirac operator are retained. Previous work along these
lines found a power-like divergence of the Dirac spectral density at zero
eigenvalue. By changing the various components of the model, we show that a
power divergence appears to be a generic feature of instanton mixing for both
Nf=0 and Nf=/=0. In the latter case the divergence disappears as m->0 in such a
way that psibar-psi remains finite. We find that the exponent of the power
decreases for larger instanton densities, becoming negligible for very dense
instanton `gases'. We reproduce the expected m-dependence of the topological
susceptibility, we investigate the space-time structure of the eigenfunctions,
as a function of the eigenvalue, and we calculate the eta-prime mass. In
summary: instantons appear to provide a natural mechanism for the spontaneous
breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD, but they typically produce a power-like
divergence in the Dirac spectral density. This divergence is non-standard but
`harmless' in the case of full QCD, and implies a pathology in the case of
quenched QCD.

up as the eigenvalue problem in Gel'fand triplet and its exact solutions are
expressed by generalized eigenfunctions belonging to complex energy eigenvalues
${V_0\mp i\Gammav_n}$ whose imaginary parts are quantized as
${\Gammav_n=(n+1/2)\hslash\gamma}$. Under the assumption that time factors of
an unstable system are square integrable, we provide a probabilistic
interpretation of them. This assumption leads to the separation of the domain
of the time evolution, namely all the time factors belonging to the complex
energy eigenvalues ${V_0-i\Gammav_n}$ exist on the future part and all those
belonging to the complex energy eigenvalues ${V_0+i\Gammav_n}$ exist on the
past part. In this model the physical energy distributions worked out from
these time factors are found to be the Breit-Wigner resonance formulas. The
half-widths of these physical energy distributions are determined by the
imaginary parts of complex energy eigenvalues, and hence they are also
quantized.

estimation of these functions is hampered by edge effects: the uncorrected,
empirical distributions of distances observed in a bounded sampling window W
give severely biased estimates of F and G. However, in this paper we show that
the corresponding {\em uncorrected} estimator of the function $J=(1-G)/(1-F)$
is approximately unbiased for the Poisson case, and is useful as a summary
statistic. Specifically, consider the estimate $\hat{J}_W$ of J computed from
uncorrected estimates of F and G. The function $J_W(r)$, estimated by
$\hat{J}_W$, possesses similar properties to the J function, for example
$J_W(r)$ is identically 1 for Poisson processes. This enables direct
interpretation of uncorrected estimates of J, something not possible with
uncorrected estimates of either F, G or K. We propose a Monte Carlo test for
complete spatial randomness based on testing whether $J_W(r)(r)\equiv 1$.
Computer simulations suggest this test is at least as powerful as tests based
on edge corrected estimators of J.

to effects neglected in previous work (both in the octupole-deformed nuclides

microscopic calculations to resolve the issue. Finally, we show that static

different concepts of ""mixed state"" for any nonlinear version of quantum theory
are introduced: (i) >genuine mixture< corresponds to operational ""mixing"" of
different ensembles, and (ii) a mixture described by single density matrix
without having a canonical operational possibility to pick out its specific
convex decomposition is called here an >elementary mixture<. Time evolution of
a class of nonlinear extensions of quantum mechanics is introduced. Evolution
of an elementary mixture cannot be generally given by evolutions of components
of its arbitrary convex decompositions. The theory is formulated in a
""geometric form"": It can be considered as a version of Hamiltonian mechanics on
infinite dimensional space of density matrices. A quantum interpretation of the
theory is sketched.

functions in Heisenberg and Schrodinger pictures to describe propagation of
electromagnetic field in a three dimensional media including diffraction is
presented. In the Schrodinger picture the Fokker-Planck equation for the
Glauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability and corresponding Langevin equations are
given. As result the space-time description is obtained by a simple changing
variables in the temporal master equation of the field. Using this formalism it
is shown that the existence of integrals of motion in the propagation of light
in a medium under the condition of nondegenerated parametric and two-photon
interactions results in amplification of modes when nonclassical properties of
the light are conserved. Quantum propagation of light in a linear medium taking
into account the diffraction is considered and its solution is found.

magnetic resonance quantum computer, which is the meaningful test of quantum
parallelism because qubits are entangled. All of the balanced and constant
functions were realized exactly. The results agree well with theoretical
predictions and clearly distinguish the balanced functions from constant
functions. Efficient refocusing schemes were proposed for the soft z-pulse and
J-coupling and it is proved that the thermal equilibrium state gives the same
results as the pure state for this algorithm.
