Model proposed by Rodrigues & Thomas (1996). While originally discussed in the
case of scale-free power spectra, it is developed and tested here in the
framework of the cold dark matter cosmology. The halo mass function, the mass
distribution of progenitors and child halos, as well as the probability
distribution of formation times, have been computed and compared to the
available analytic predictions. The halo auto-correlation function has also
been obtained (a first for a semi-analytic merging tree), and tested against
analytic formulae. An overall good agreement is found between results of the
model, and the predictions derived from the Press & Schechter theory and its
extensions. More severe discrepancies appear when formulae that better describe
N-body simulations are used for comparison. In many instances, the model can be
a useful tool for following the hierarchical growth of structures. In
particular, it is suitable for addressing the issue of the formation and
evolution of galaxy clusters, as well as the population of Lyman-break galaxies
at high redshift, and their clustering properties.

photometrically and spectroscopically for nearly 2 yr. At the time of discovery
SN 1997cy was the brightest SN ever observed (Mv=<-20.1, v(hel)=19140 km/s,
H_0=65 km/s/Mpc). Up to the last available observations (600 days after the
GRB) the total time-integrated flux was equal to or larger than that expected
from the complete thermalization of the gamma-rays produced by 2.3 Mo of 56Co.
However, starting already on day 60 the luminosity decline is slower than the
56Co decay rate, indicating that the SN ejecta was interacting with
circumstellar material (CSM). The interaction appeared to weaken around day
550. The spectra of SN 1997cy are dominated at all epochs by Halpha emission,
which shows at least 3 components of different widths, as in SN 1988Z. Several
other lines with different widths are also visible, especially at early epochs.
The entire light curve of SN 1997cy is reproduced by a model of the interaction
of the very energetic (E=5 x 10^(52) ergs) ejecta of a massive star (25 Mo)
with the CSM, with some contribution from radioactive decays. The CSM could
have been ejected with a mass-loss rate of Mdot ~ 4x10^(-4) Mo yr^(-1) as the
progenitor star evolved from a BSG to a RSG about 10^4 yr before the explosion.
The lack of oxygen and magnesium lines in the spectra at nebular phases poses a
problem for models requiring high mass progenitors. The possibility that most
of the core material of the progenitor has fallen onto a massive black hole so
that the reverse shock dies at the inner edge of the H/He envelope is
discussed.

diagrams obtained for these globulars have allowed a measurement of their ages
relative to M5 (NGC 5904), which is a well-observed, much closer cluster.
Assuming that the globular clusters share the same chemical composition, Pal
4/Eridanus have been reported to be younger than M5 by ~1-2 Gyr, based on both
the magnitude difference between the horizontal branch (HB) and the turnoff and
the difference in color between the turnoff and the lower subgiant branch. In
the present article, we address the following question: What age difference
would be required to account for the difference in HB types between M5 and Pal
4/Eridanus, assuming age to be the ""second parameter""? We find that, unless all
these clusters (including M5) are younger than 10 Gyr, such an age difference
is substantially larger than that based on an analysis of the cluster turnoffs.
To reach such a conclusion, six different analytical mass loss rate formulae
(reported in an Appendix), all implying a dependence of mass loss on the red
giant branch on age, were employed. Our results appear to be in conflict with
claims that age can be the only second parameter in the Galactic globular
cluster system.

binary-microlensing events towards the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). It is found that the rotation effects cannot
always be neglected when the lens binaries are in the LMC disk or the SMC disk,
i.e., when they are self-lensing. Therefore we suggest that it will be
necessary to consider the rotation effects in the analyses of the coming binary
events if the microlensing events towards the halo are self-lensing. As an
example, we reexamine the MACHO LMC-9 event, in which the slow transverse
velocity of the lens binary suggests a microlensing event in the LMC disk. From
a simple analysis, it is shown that the lens binary with total mass $\sim
1M_{\odot}$ rotates by more than $\sim 60^{\circ}$ during the Einstein radius
crossing time. However, the fitting of MACHO LMC-9 with an additional
parameter, the rotation period, shows that the rotation effects are small,
i.e., the projected rotation angle is only $\sim 5.9^{\circ}
(M/M_{\odot})^{1/4}$ during the Einstein radius crossing time. This
contradiction can be settled if the physical parameters, such as the mass and
the velocity, are different in this event, the binary is nearly edge-on, or the
binary is very eccentric, though definite conclusions cannot be drawn from this
single event. If the microlensing events towards the halo are due to
self-lensing, binary-events for which the rotation effects are important will
increase and stronger constraints on the nature of the lenses will be obtained.

state of Her X-1 and a short observation during the decline of the preceding
main-on state. The 0.1-10 keV spectra can be fit with a power-law and blackbody
model together with Fe emission features at 1.0 keV and 6.5 keV. During the
later stages of the short-on state there are long intervals when the absorption
is $\approxgt$$5 \times 10^{22}$ atom cm$^{-2}$. These intervals become longer
and occur ~0.3 day earlier in each orbital cycle as the short-on state
progresses. During the intervals of high absorption the 0.1 keV blackbody is
still clearly detected. This may indicate the presence of separate scattered
and absorbed spectral components, although other explanations such as partial
covering or a partially ionized absorber cannot be excluded. During the rest of
the short-on state the ratio of flux in the blackbody compared to the power-law
is consistent with that in the main-on state. This supports the view that much
of the 35 day modulation is caused by an energy independent process, such as
electron scattering. The discovery of strong absorption late in the short-on
state is consistent with the predictions of the warped disk model (Petterson
1977, see also Schandl & Meyer 1994) where the end of the short-on state is
caused by the accretion disk moving into the line of sight to the neutron star.

around low mass WR stars, or [WR] stars. It especially focuses on the
differences which can be expected due to the different character of the fast
winds from these [WR] stars. Their fast winds are more massive and are highly H
deficient and metal enriched compared to the winds of normal central stars of
planetary nebulae. This is expected to lead to faster expansion velocities for
the nebulae and a longer momentum-driven phase in the evolution of the
wind-driven bubble, leading to more turbulent nebulae. The observational
evidence also shows that the process which produces the [WR] stars is unlikely
to influence the onset of aspherical mass loss, something which can be used as
a test for models for aspherical mass loss from AGB and post-AGB stars. Finally
it is shown that the nebular characteristics rule out a very late He shell
flash as the origin of most [WR] stars.

core, and its major axis is oriented in proyection along the spin axis of the

  The V-H (F606W - F160W) image reveals a complex gas/dust distribution with a
two-arm spiral structure of about 225 pc in radius. The southwestern arm is
traced by young star-forming knots while the northeastern arm is detected by
the presence of dust lanes. These spirals do not have a smooth structure but
rather they are made of smaller flocculent spirals or filament-like structures.
The magnitudes and colors of the star-forming knots are typical of clusters of
young stars with masses of 0.5 to 1 x $10^5 M_{solar}, and ages of 5 to 25

  The overall structure of the nuclear spirals as well as the size, number and

gaseous nuclear disk subject to self-gravitational instabilities and to the
gravitational field created by the nuclear bar. According to the model, the
gaseous disk has a mass of about 5 x 10^7 M_{solar} inside a radius of 400 pc,
the bar has a radius of 150 pc and a pattern speed of about 0.5 Myr^{-1}, and

itself independently rather than contributing to the gravitational field. The
contribution of the electric field to the spacetime metric outside the charged
sphere is shown to be similar to the gravitational one in the Schwartzschild
metric but with a charge-to-mass ratio dependence of the test particle instead
of the Reissner - Nordstr\""om metric, resulting in a unified description of
gravitation and electromagnetism. We point out that there are existing
experiments whose results can be explained by the equivalence principle for the
electromagnetic field presented here. Additional experimental predictions of

the ability of this gauge to locate center vortices inserted by hand on any

and why it is expected not only in maximal center gauge, but also in an
infinite class of gauge conditions based on adjoint-representation link
variables. In principle, the vortex-finding property can be foiled by Gribov
copies. This fact is relevant to a gauge-fixing procedure devised by Kovacs and
Tomboulis, where we show that the loss of center dominance, found in their
procedure, is explained by a corresponding loss of the vortex-finding property.
The association of center dominance with the vortex-finding property is
demonstrated numerically in a number of other gauges.

relationship between the flow of quantum information and the causal structure

information may flow across them in two directions. A discrete background
independent holographic theory may be formulated in terms of information
flowing in a causal network of such screens. Geometry is introduced by defining
the area of a screen to be a measure of its capacity as a channel of quantum

accompanied by experimental errors. The introduction of the equivalence being
consistent with the mathematical definition is possible only in theories
constructed on non-standard number spaces by taking the experimental errors as
infinitesimal numbers of the non-standard spaces. Following the idea for the
equivalence (the physical equivalence), a new description of space-time in
terms of infinitesimal-lattice points on non-standard real number space $\SR$
is proposed. The infinitesimal-lattice space, $^*{\cal L}$, is represented by
the set of points on $\SR$ which are written by $l_n=n\SE$, where the
infinitesimal lattice-spacing $\SE$ is determined by a non-standard natural
number $^*N$ such that $\SE\equiv ^*N^{-1}$. By using infinitesimal
neighborhoos ($\MON$) of real number $r$ on $\SL$ we can make a space $\SM$
which is isomorphic to $\RE$ as additive group. Therefore, every point on
$(\SM)^N$ automatically has the internal confined-subspace $\MON$. A field
theory on $\SL$ is proposed. To determine a projection from $\SL$ to $\SM$, a
fundamental principle based on the physical equivalence is introduced. The
physical equivalence is expressed by the totally equal treatment for
indistinguishable quantities in our observations. Following the principle, we
show that U(1) and SU(N) symmetries on the space $(\SM)^N$ are induced from the
internal substructure $(\MON)^N$. Quantized state describing configuration
space is constructed on $(\SM)^N$. We see that Lorentz and general relativistic

properties of supersonic pulse solitons in anharmonic chains. We show that in
the case of ultra-long-range (e.g., screened Coulomb) interactions three
different types of pulse solitons coexist in a certain velocity interval: one
type is unstable but the two others are stable. The high-energy stable soliton
is broad and can be described in the quasicontinuum approximation. But the
low-energy stable soliton consists of two components, short-range and
long-range ones, and can be considered as a bound state of these components.

activity in cat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and in their target lateral
geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons under various stimulus conditions, and we
develop a new measure to examine correlations in fractal activity between
spike-train pairs. In the absence of stimulation (i.e., in the dark), RGC and
LGN discharges exhibit similar properties. The presentation of a constant,
uniform luminance to the eye reduces the fractal fluctuations in the RGC
maintained discharge but enhances them in the target LGN discharge, so that
neural activity in the pair no longer mirror each other. A drifting-grating
stimulus yields RGC and LGN driven spike trains similar in character to those
observed in the maintained discharge, with two notable distinctions: action
potentials are reorganized along the time axis so that they occur only during
certain phases of the stimulus waveform, and fractal activity is suppressed.
Under both uniform-luminance and drifting-grating stimulus conditions (but not
in the dark), the discharges of pairs of LGN cells are highly correlated over
long time scales; in contrast discharges of RGCs are nearly uncorrelated with
each other. This indicates that action-potential activity at the LGN is subject
to a common fractal modulation to which the RGCs are not subjected.

  Changes Editorial",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The behavior of mass is well known, as described by Newton's Laws of Motion,
the Lorentz Contractions, and Einstein's mass - energy equivalence. But just
what mass is, how those behaviors come about, what in material reality produces
the effects of mass, has been little understood.
  The only extant hypothesis is that of the ""Higgs Field"" and its related
particle, the Higgs Boson. Neither has been detected in spite of significant
efforts to do so. Further, that hypothesis is not so much a description of the
mechanics of mass as a further abstraction away from the problem by
substituting another field to explain what is not well understood.
  From a starting point of only the limitation on the speed of light, the
necessity of conservation, and the impossibility of an infinity in material
reality, the present paper presents a new and comprehensive analysis of the
phenomenon inertial mass:
  - how rest mass appears in particles,
  - how the Newtonian behavior arises from that, and
  - how the Lorentz Contractions operate in/on it, or, in other words, the
mechanics of inertial mass.

polarized laser field are considered. The starting point is the classical
relativistic action for a free electron moving in the electromagnetic field
created by a strong laser beam. This action has been used to calculate
semiclassical transition rates. Simple analytical expressions for the
ionization rate, the photoelectron emission velocity and for the drift momentum
distribution of the photoelectron have been found. The analytical formulas
apply to nonrelativistic bound systems as well as to initial states with an
energy corresponding to the upper boundary of the lower continuum and to the
tunnel as well as the multiphoton regime. In the case of a nonrelativistic
bound system we recover the Keldysh formula for the ionization rate.
Relativistic effects in the initial state lead to a weak enhancement of the
rate of sub-barrier ionization and to the appearance of a nonzero photoelectron
leaving velocity.

is usually explained by decoherence, and viewed as a gradual process. The study
of entanglement, or quantum correlations, in noisy quantum computers implies
that in some cases the transition from quantum to classical is actually a phase
transition. We define the notion of entanglement length in $d$-dimensional
noisy quantum computers, and show that a phase transition in entanglement
occurs at a critical noise rate, where the entanglement length transforms from
infinite to finite. Above the critical noise rate, macroscopic classical
behavior is expected, whereas below the critical noise rate, subsystems which
are macroscopically distant one from another can be entangled.
  The macroscopic classical behavior in the super-critical phase is shown to
hold not only for quantum computers, but for any quantum system composed of
macroscopically many finite state particles, with local interactions and local
decoherence, subjected to some additional conditions.
  This phenomenon provides a possible explanation to the emergence of classical
behavior in such systems. A simple formula for an upper bound on the
entanglement length of any such system in the super-critical phase is given,
which can be tested experimentally.
