  publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/308487",,"astro-ph",,"  A neutron star in a long-lived, low-mass binary can easily accrete enough
matter to replace its entire crust. Previous authors noted that an accreted
crust, being formed from the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium, allows a
series of non-equilibrium reactions, at densities >6e11 g/cc, which release a
substantial amount of heat (1 MeV per accreted nucleon). Recent calculations by
Schatz et al. showed that the crystalline lattice of an accreted crust is also
likely to be quite impure. This paper discusses the thermal structure of such a
neutron star and surveys how the crust reactions and impurities affect the
crust temperature. During accretion rapid enough to make the accreted hydrogen
and helium burn stably (near the Eddington accretion rate; typical of the
brightest low-mass neutron star binaries), most of the heat released in the
crust is conducted into the core, where neutrino emission regulates the
temperature. As a result there is an inversion of the thermal gradient: the
temperature decreases with depth in the inner crust. The thermal structure in
the crust at these high accretion rates is insensitive to the temperature in
the hydrogen/helium burning shell. When the crust is very impure, the
temperature can reach approximately 8e8 K at densities > 6e11 g/cc. This peak
temperature depends mostly on the amount of heat released and the thermal
conductivity and in particular is roughly independent of the core temperature.
The high crust temperatures are sufficient to melt the crystalline lattice in
thin layers where electron captures have substantially reduced the nuclear
charge.

reveal a previously unknown hard X-ray component in NGC 7582, peaking close to
20 keV. Rapid variability is observed with correlated changes in the 5-10 and
13-60 keV bands indicating that a single continuum component, produced by the
active nucleus, provides the dominant flux across both bands. Changes in the
nuclear X-ray flux appear unrelated to the gradual decline in optical flux
noted since the high-state in 1998 July. The X-ray continuum is attenuated by a
thick absorber of N_H ~ 1.6 x 10E24 cm^-2 covering ~60% of the nucleus, plus a
screen with N_H ~ 1.4 x 10E23 cm^-2 covering the entire nucleus. Comparison of
the BeppoSAX and ASCA spectra shows an increase in the full screen by N_H ~7 x
10E22 cm^-2 since 1994, confirming the absorption variability found by Xue et
al. The increase in soft X-ray flux between 1994 and 1998 is consistent with
the appearance of holes in the full screen producing some clear lines-of-sight

show that there is an enhancement in the Coma line of sight of field galaxies
compared to classical field counts. This can be explained by the contribution
of groups and of a distant $z\sim 0.5$ cluster along the line of sight. The
result is that the Coma GLF appears to turn-over or at least to become flat for
the faint galaxies. We suggest that this is due to environmental effects.

the variability characteristics of the sources to be consistent with Seyf-1s. A
powerlaw offers an acceptable description of the time-averaged spectra in the
2-10 keV (RQQ-frame) band for all but 1 dataset. The photon indices vary from
object to object over the range 1.5~<Gamma(2-10 keV)~<3 with a mean
Gamma(2-10keV)~2 and dispersion ~=0.25. The distribution of Gamma(2-10 keV is
therefore similar to that observed in other RQ AGN, and seems unrelated to
X-ray luminosity. No single model adequately describes the full 0.6-10 keV
(obs-frame) continuum of all the RQQs. ~50% of the sources can be described by
a single powerlaw (or with only very subtle deviations). All but one of the
remaining datasets have convex spectra (flattening to higher energies). The
exception is PG 1411+442, in which a substantial column density obscures ~98%
of the continuum. We find only 5 (or 6) of 14 objects with z<~0.25 to have a
'soft excess' at energies <~1 keV, but find no universal shape for these
spectral components. The spectrum of PG 1244+026 contains an emission feature
at ~1 keV. The detection rate of absorption due to ionized material in these
RQQs is lower than in Seyf-1s. In part, this may be due to selection effects.
However, when detected, the absorbers in the RQQs exhibit a similar range of
column density and ionization parameter as Seyf-1s. We find evidence of Fe
K-shell emission in at least 8 RQQs. These are all low-luminosity objects, and
the line parameters are consistent with other low-luminosity RQ AGN. However we
find a trend whereby the profile and strength of the Fe K-shell emission
changes as a function of luminosity.

significantly more shallow than profiles derived from most N-body simulations;
unlike previous HI observations, beam-smearing cannot significantly affect this
result. Based upon stellar mass profiles derived from K' band observations, we
derive the angular momentum distribution of the stellar disk and find it to be
broader than that of a uniformly rotating solid-body sphere, but remarkably
consistent from galaxy-to-galaxy. Finally, based upon K' band surface
brightness profiles, we find that low surface density disks must be
significantly sub-maximal. Furthermore, maximal disk fits based upon Modified
Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) have maximum mass-to-light ratios which are too small
to be consistent with stellar population models; without the ability to
significantly adjust inclination angles or infrared mass-to-light ratios, this
sample presents great difficulties for MOND.

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations including star formation and feedback.
Our $\Lambda$CDM simulation, together with Bruzual-Charlot population synthesis

this agreement. In our simulation, these galaxies are predominantly the most
massive objects at this epoch, and have a significant population of older

residual nuclear burning. The cooling ages are consistent with age estimations
of MSP systems based on the pulsars' spin-down. For example, for the system PSR

with the spin-down age of 7 Gyr. For the companion mass we found M=0.19 +/-

so far published and the only one with a large number of spectroscopically

resembles an inverted S-shape filament with the X-rays coming from the midpoint
of the filament. The ROSAT HRI contours have an elongated shape that roughly
coincide with the weak lensing contours. ASCA measures a low temperature,
kT=5.7 keV. Keck-II LRIS spectra indicate a very high velocity dispersion, of
sigma(v)=1522 km/s. While the temperature is commensurate with its X-ray
luminosity, its velocity dispersion is much higher than expected from the
sigma(v)-T(X) relationship of present-day clusters with comparable X-ray
luminosity. RXJ1716.6+6708 could be an example of a protocluster, where matter
is flowing along filaments and the X-ray flux is maximum at the impact point of
the colliding streams of matter.

theoretical interpretations of large-scale structure. But to explain my feeling
that we may still have a lot to learn I offer some comments on our sociology,
informed by social construction, in adopting lines of thought that tend not to
follow straightforward readings of what is observed. Thus galaxies are thought
to be affected by environment, not only in the morphology-density relation, but
also as the cause of biased formation. But the Tully-Fisher and fundamental
plane relations do not allow much room for the contingencies of environment. It
is thought that the galaxy distribution is not likely to be closely related to
the mass, yet most dynamical analyses indicate that if the mean density is low
then optically selected galaxies are good mass tracers. The evidence is that at
redshift unity the larger spiral and elliptical galaxies were by and large in
place, as were a good fraction of the great clusters of galaxies. These
galaxies evolve slowly at $z<1$, yet we hears of rapid evolution not much
before this, in galaxy formation. Perhaps all these examples are misleading.
But, as Kuhn has taught us, complex interpretations of simple phenomena have
been known to be precursors of paradigm shifts.

cutoff of $\sim 5\times 10^{19}$ eV challenges orthodox modeling. We discuss a
possible solution which uses standard hot Big Bang cosmology and Standard Model
(SM) particle physics augmented only by $\lsim $ eV neutrino masses as
suggested by solar, atmospheric, and terrestrial neutrino detection. In this
scheme, cosmic ray neutrinos from distant, highest-energy sources annihilate
resonantly on the relic-neutrino background to produce Z-bosons. The
highly-boosted ($\gamma_Z\sim 10^{11}$) Z's instantly decay, producing
""Z-bursts"" of highly-collimated jets of hadrons and photons. The burst content
includes, on average, twenty photons and two nucleons with super-GZK energies.
We show that the probability for each neutrino with energy within a fraction
$\Gamma_Z/M_Z$ of the resonant value $E_R=4(eV/m_\nu)\times 10^{21}$ eV to
annihilate within the halo of our galactic supercluster is likely within an
order of magnitude of 1%. Depending on the magnitude of the cosmic neutrino
flux above 10^{20} eV, this ""local"" rate for primary production may be high
enough to produce the cosmic ray events observed above the GZK cutoff. Several
tests of this Z-burst hypothesis for generating super-GZK events are presented,
including (i) a new cutoff energy at E_R; (ii) a large $\gamma/p$ ratio for
primaries near the upper end of the spectrum; (iii) directional pairing of
events, and pointing to their cosmic sources; and (iv) a neutrino flux above
the GZK cutoff energy which is possibly measurable directly in proposed $\gsim
10^{11}$ ton cosmic-ray detectors.

constraints imposed on the kinematically-accessible phase space by data
selection cuts and find that, as a result of the pseudo-rapidity cut which is

the data with a two-gluon dijet model. The results of this analysis are

reaction D(e,pp)e'pi- on polarized deuteron were measured. The kinetic energies
of the protons were measured within 55-180 MeV and 46-265 MeV. The polar
acceptance angles in laboratory frame for the both protons are (64 - 82)
degrees and the azimuthal angles are (-16 +16), (164 - 196) degrees. The sharp
peak of the tensor a(20)-component of the target asymmetry is found near the
invariant mass of the pppi-system M(pppi) = 2300 MeV/c**2. The performed
calculations of the differential yield and the tensor target asymmetry do not
describe the obtained experimental results.

the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation for the dressed quark-photon vertex to study
the low-momentum behavior of the pion electromagnetic form factor. With model
gluon parameters previously fixed by the pion mass and decay constant, the pion
charge radius $r_\pi$ is found to be in excellent agreement with the data. When
the often-used Ball-Chiu Ansatz is used to construct the quark-photon vertex
directly from the quark propagator, less than half of $r_\pi^2$ is generated.
The remainder of $r^2_\pi$ is seen to be attributable to the presence of the
$\rho$-pole in the solution of the ladder Bethe-Salpeter equation.

boundary effects. Specific examples are considered for better illustration.

number of periods of oscillations in the underline continuous-time lattice.
