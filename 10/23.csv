spectrum radio source 3C 318 which shows it to be a quasar at redshift z=1.574
(the z=0.752 value previously reported is incorrect). 3C 318 is an IRAS, ISO
and SCUBA source so its new redshift makes it the most intrinsically luminous
far-infrared (FIR) source in the 3C catalogue (there is no evidence of strong
gravitational lensing effects). Its bolometric luminosity greatly exceeds the
10^13 solar luminosity level above which an object is said to be hyperluminous.
Its spectral energy distribution (SED) requires that the quasar heats the dust
responsible for the FIR flux, as is believed to be the case in other
hyperluminous galaxies, and contributes (at the >10% level) to the heating of
the dust responsible for the sub-mm emission. We cannot determine whether a
starburst makes an important contribution to the heating of the coolest dust,
so evidence for a high star-formation rate (SFR) is circumstantial being based
on the high dust mass required by its sub-mm detection. We show that the
current sub-mm and FIR data available for high-z radio galaxies are consistent
with SEDs similar to that of 3C 318. This indicates that at least some of this
population may be detected in the sub-mm because of dust heated by the quasar
nucleus, and that interpreting sub-mm detection as evidence for very high SFRs
may not always be valid. We show that the 3C318 quasar is slightly reddened
(A(V) ~ 0.5), the most likely cause of which is SMC-type dust in the host
galaxy. If very distant radio galaxies are reddened in a similar way then we
show that only slightly greater amounts of dust could obscure the quasars in
these sources, thus explaining the low fraction of quasars amongst the very
high redshift (z > 3) objects in low-frequency radio-selected samples.

at 21 epochs. The radio nucleus appeared resolved, so comparisons were limited
to observations spanning 10-60 days and 3-4 yr, and acquired at matched

word sense disambiguation systems. To construct a database of practical size, a
considerable overhead for manual sense disambiguation (overhead for
supervision) is required. In addition, the time complexity of searching a
large-sized database poses a considerable problem (overhead for search). To
counter these problems, our method selectively samples a smaller-sized
effective subset from a given example set for use in word sense disambiguation.
Our method is characterized by the reliance on the notion of training utility:
the degree to which each example is informative for future example sampling
when used for the training of the system. The system progressively collects
examples by selecting those with greatest utility. The paper reports the
effectiveness of our method through experiments on about one thousand
sentences. Compared to experiments with other example sampling methods, our
method reduced both the overhead for supervision and the overhead for search,
without the degeneration of the performance of the system.

the quantum analogue of the classical area function. This leads to one of the
key results of loop quantum gravity: the derivation of the discreteness of the
geometry and the computation of the quanta of area. Finally, an outlock on a

and to solutions of the nonlinear field equations in a rigid (unperturbed)
spacetime, in order to isolate gravitational phenomena. We consider two types
of initial conditions: where only one mode of the field perturbation has a
non-zero initial amplitude, and where all the modes begin with a non-zero
amplitude. Here we focus on preheating following inflation driven by a scalar
field with a quartic potential. We confirm the broad picture of preheating
obtained from the nonlinear field equations in a rigid background, but
gravitational effects have a measurable impact on the dynamics for both sets of
initial data. The rigid spacetime results predict that the amplitude of a
single initially excited mode drops rapidly after resonance ends, whereas in
the relativistic case the amplitude is roughly constant. With all modes
initially excited, the longest modes in the simulation grow much more rapidly
in the relativistic calculation than with a rigid background. However, we see
no evidence for the sort of gravitational collapse associated with the
formation of primordial black holes. The numerical codes described here are
easily extended to more complicated resonant models, which we will examine in
the future.

former is exceptional if and only if the latter is exceptional. So we study the
weighted homogeneous case and prove that the number of weights of weighted
homogeneous exceptional singularities are finite. Then we determine all
exceptional singularities of the Brieskorn type of dimension 3.

of doubly closed shell nuclei, from $^{12}$C to $^{208}$Pb, with semirealistic
and realistic two- and three-nucleon interactions. The studies are carried on
within the framework of the correlated basis function theory and integral
equations technique, with state dependent correlations having central and
tensor components. We report results for the ground state energy, one- and
two-body densities and static structure functions. For $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca
we use modern interactions and find that the accuracy of the method is
comparable to that attained in nuclear matter with similar hamiltonians, giving
nuclei underbound by $\sim$2 MeV/A. The computed Coulomb sums are in complete
agreement with the latest analysis of the experimental data.

based on two level quantum systems. In this letter, a new protocol for quantum
key distribution based on higher dimensional systems is presented. An
experimental realization using an interferometric setup is also proposed.
Analyzing this protocol from the practical side, one finds an increased key
creation rate while keeping the initial laser pulse rate constant. Analyzing it
for the case of intercept/resend eavesdropping strategy, an increased error
rate is found compared to two dimensional systems, hence an advantage for the
legitimate users to detect an eavesdropper.

out to be generally deformed oscillator algebras. It is found that the even and

eigenvalue and they can be viewed as two-photon nonlinear coherent states. Two
methods of generating such states are proposed.
