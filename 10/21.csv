  1999",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate the clustering properties of high-redshift galaxies within
three competing scenarios for assigning luminous galaxies to dark matter halos
from N-body simulations: a one galaxy per massive halo model, a quiescent star
formation model, and a collisional starburst model. We compare these models to
observations of Lyman-Break galaxies at z~3$ With current data and the simple
statistic used here, one cannot rule out any of these models, but we see
potential for finding distinguishing features using statistics that are
sensitive to the tails of the distribution, and statistics based on the number
of multiple galaxies per halo, which we explore in an ongoing study.

wavelengths between different lines of sight over the whole redshift range. The
significance rises to 3.2 sigma if we restrict the redshift range to 2.60 < z <

equivalent width 0.1 <= W0/(A) < 0.9. We conclude that a significant fraction
of the Lyman alpha forest arises in structures whose correlation length extends
at least over 30 arcmin (~26/h comoving Mpc at z=2.6 for H0 = 100h km/s/Mpc,
Omega=1.0, Lambda=0). We have also calculated the three dimensional two point
correlation function for Lyman alpha absorbers; we do not detect any
significant signal in the data. However, we note that line blending prevents us
from detecting the signal produced by a 100% overdensity of Lyman alpha

iron. In the latter event, neutron stars would be largely composed of pure

galaxy-size halos in cosmological models. Recent progress in numerical
techniques made it possible to simulate halos in large volumes with a such
accuracy that halos survive in dense environments of groups and clusters of
galaxies. Dark matter halos in simulations look like real galaxies, and, thus,
can be used to study the biases - differences between galaxies and the dark
matter. For the standard LCDM model we find that the correlation function and
the power spectrum of galaxy-size halos at z=0 are antibiased on scales
r<5Mpc/h and k=(0.15-30)h/Mpc. The biases depend on scale, redshift, and
circular velocities of selected halos. Two processes seem to define the
evolution of the spatial bias: (1) statistical bias (or peak bias) and merger
bias (merging of galaxies, which happens preferentially in groups, reduces the
number of galaxies, but does not affect the clustering of the dark matter).
There are two kinds of velocity bias. The pair-wise velocity bias is
b_12=0.6-0.8 at r<5Mpc/h, z=0. This bias mostly reflects the spatial bias and
provides almost no information on the relative velocities of the galaxies and
the dark matter. One-point velocity bias is a better measure of the velocities.
Inside clusters the galaxies should move slightly faster (b_v=1.1-1.3) than the
dark matter. Qualitatively this result can be understood using the Jeans
equations of the stellar dynamics.

arcsec-scale, unresolved emission that dominates the line flux in ground-based

regions with sizes of tens to hundreds of parsecs that are resolved into knots,
filaments, and diffuse gas whose morphology differs from galaxy to galaxy. Most
of the galaxies do not show clear linear structures or ionization cones
analogous to those often seen in Seyfert galaxies. An exception is NGC 1052,
the prototypical LINER, in which we find a 3 arcsec-long (~ 250 pc) biconical
structure that is oriented on the sky along the galaxy's radio jet axis. Seven
of the galaxies have been shown in previously published HST images to have a
bright compact ultraviolet nuclear source, while the other seven do not have a
central UV source. Our images find evidence of dust in the nuclear regions of
all 14 galaxies, with clear indications of nuclear obscuration in most of the
""UV-dark"" cases. The data suggest that the line-emitting gas in most LINERs is
photoionized by a central source (which may be stellar, nonstellar, or a
combination thereof) but that this source is often hidden from direct view. We
find no obvious morphological differences between LINERs with detected weak
broad H-alpha wings in their spectra and those with only narrow lines.
Likewise, there is no clear morphological distinction between objects whose UV
spectra are dominated by hot stars (e.g., NGC 4569) and those that are AGN-like

ultraviolet to the visible, including narrow band H(alpha) using WIYN and HST
data, to determine how star formation processes affect the morphology and
integrated fluxes of nearby starbursts. We find the UV/H(alpha) morphology of
starbursts tend to differ, although not in a standard or predictable manner.
  From our sample of six nearby starbursts, three systems show a good
correlation between UV and H(alpha) fluxes, but we find differences in UV and
H(alpha) morphology between the other three. Occasionally we find systems with
well defined H II regions without the corresponding brightness in the UV, and
vice-versa. We discuss the likely mechanisms behind these differences which
include: starburst ages, dust absorption, stellar energy ejecta through SNe and
winds, as well as leakage of UV photons from stellar clusters. We conclude that
the large scale morphological features in starbursts are primarily due to both
age and absorption from a `picket fence' dust distribution.
  We further demonstrate the similarity and differences between these nearby
starbursts and high redshift star forming galaxies. The overall morphology of
our sample of starbursts changes little between UV and visible wavelengths. If
high redshift galaxies are similar to these starbursts, their morphologies
should change little between rest-frame UV and optical. We also show that FIR
and UV spectral energy distributions and slopes can be used to determine large
scale morphological features for extreme starbursts, with the steepest FIR
slopes correlating with the most disturbed galaxies.

correlation between absolute luminosity and ejected fraction of gas from
outflows. It is found that the correlations between color or mass-to-light
ratios and absolute luminosity are degenerate with respect to most of the input
parameters. However, a significant change between monolithic and hierarchical
models is predicted for redshifts $z\simgt 1$. The comparison between predicted
and observed mass-to-light ratios yield an approximate linear bias between
total and stellar masses: $M_{\rm Tot}\propto M_{\rm St}^{1.15\pm 0.08}$ in
early-type galaxies. If we assume that outflows constitute the driving
mechanism for the colors observed in cluster early type galaxies, the
metallicity of the intracluster medium (ICM) can be linked to outflows. The
color-magnitude constraint requires faint $M_V\sim -16$ galaxies to eject 85%
of their gas, which means that most of the metals in the ICM may have
originated in these dwarf galaxies.

regarding the ergodicity of individual high-energy eigenstates of classically

theory on the other. It seems likely that some eigenstate statistics and
long-time transport behavior bear nonrandom imprints of the underlying
classical dynamics while simultaneously obeying Schnirelman's theorem. Indeed
this was shown earlier in the case of systems which approach classical
ergodicity slowly, and is also realized in the scarring of eigenstates, even in
the $\hbar \to 0$ limit, along unstable periodic orbits and their manifolds.
Here we demonstrate the nonrandom character of eigenstates of Sinai-like
systems. We show that mixing between channels in Sinai systems is dramatically
deficient compared to random matrix theory predictions. The deficit {\it
increases} as $|\log \hbar|$ for $\hbar\to 0$, and is due to the vicinity of
the measure zero set of orbits which never collide with the Sinai obstruction.
Coarse graining to macroscopic scales recovers the Schnirelman result. Three
systems are investigated here: a Sinai-type billiard, a quantum map which
possesses the essential properties of the Sinai billiard, and a unitary map
corresponding to a quasirandom Hamiltonian. Various wavefunction and long-time
transport statistics are defined, theoretically investigated, and compared to

by an external, non-conservative force, analogous to a shear force in a fluid.
In this scenario, the drive results in the suppression of the usual aging
process, and the correlation and response functions become time translation
invariant. The relaxation time and the response functions are then dependent on
the intensity of the drive and on temperature. We investigate this dependence
within the framework of a dynamical closure approximation that becomes exact
for disordered, fully-connected models. The relaxation time is shown to be a
decreasing function of the drive (``shear thinning'' effect). The correlation
functions below the glass transition temperature (Tc) display a two time scales
relaxation pattern, similar to that observed at equilibrium slightly above Tc.
We also study the violation of the fluctuation dissipation relationship in the
driven system. This violation is very reminiscent of the one that takes place
in a system aging below Tc at zero drive. It involves in particular the
appearance of a two-temperatures regime, in the sense of an effective
fluctuation dissipation temperature. Although our results are in principle
limited to the closure relations that hold for mean-field models, we argue that
a number of the salient features are not inherent to the approximation scheme,
and may be tested in experiments and simulations.

multicanonically, to favor paths leading to `gateway' arrangements for which

extensive studies of systems of hard spheres. We show that the efficiency of
the method is controlled by the extent to which the switch conserves correlated
microstructure. We also show how, microscopically, the procedure works: the

independence of the mass spectrum and gauge dependences of the boundstate wave
functions are dictated. We give formal arguments based on the BRST symmetry

illustration: (1)we calculate Q up to O(1/c), (2)we examine gauge dependences

cumbersome gauge cancellations can be circumvented by directly calculating Q.
As an application we point out that the present calculations of top quark

also show possibilities for incorrect calculations of physical quantities of
boundstates when the on-shell matching procedure is employed. We give a proof
of a justification for the use of the equation of motion to simplify the form

an axial vector coupled to a Dirac spinor field. A massive axial vector
describes antisymmetric torsion. The consistency conditions include unitarity
and renormalizability in the low-energy region. The investigation of the Ward
identities and the one- and two-loop divergences indicate serious problems
arising in the theory. The final conclusion is that torsion may exist as a
string excitation, but there are very severe restrictions for the existence of
a propagating torsion field, subject to the quantization procedure, at low
energies.
