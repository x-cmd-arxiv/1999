B1937+21. We have undertaken a systematic study of giant pulses from PSR
B1937+21 using the Arecibo telescope at 430, 1420, and 2380 MHz. At 430 MHz,
interstellar scattering broadens giant pulses to durations of $\sim50 \mu$secs,
but at higher frequencies the pulses are very short, typically lasting only
$\sim1$-$2 \mu$secs. At each frequency, giant pulses are emitted only in narrow
($\lsim10 \mu$s) windows of pulse phase located $\sim 55$-$70 \mu$sec after the
main and interpulse peaks. Although some pulse-to-pulse jitter in arrival times
is observed, the mean arrival phase appears stable; a timing analysis of the
giant pulses yields precision competitive with the best average profile timing
studies. We have measured the intensity distribution of the giant pulses,
confirming a roughly power-law distribution with approximate index of -1.8,
contributing $\gsim0.1%$ to the total flux at each frequency. We also find that
the intensity of giant pulses falls off with a slightly steeper power of
frequency than the ordinary radio emission.

close enough to gravitationally perturb their hot, X-ray emitting gas flows. We
ran several 2D, time dependent hydrodynamical models to investigate the effects
of such perturbations on the gas flow inside elliptical galaxies. In
particular, we studied in detail the modifications occurring in the scenario
proposed by D'Ercole et al. (1989), in which the galactic interstellar medium
produced by the aging galactic stellar population, is heated by SNIa at a
decreasing rate. We find that, although the tidal interaction in our models
lasts less than 1 Gyr, its effect extends over several Gyrs. The tidally
induced turbulent flows create dense filaments which cool quickly and accrete
onto the galactic center, producing large spikes in the global Lx. Once this
mechanism starts, it is fed by gravity and amplified by SNIa. In cooling flow
models without supernovae the amplitude of the Lx fluctuations due to the tidal
interaction is substantially reduced. We conclude that, if SNIa significantly
contribute to the energetics of the gas flows in ellipticals, then the observed
spread in the Lx-Lb diagram may be caused, at least in part, by this mechanism.
On the contrary, tidal interactions cannot be responsible for the observed
spread if the pure cooling flow scenario applies (abridged).

being apparently inhomogeneous at ranges usually considered as local. Such

limits where, in theory, we can detect apparent homogeneity, and it was found
that this may only happen up to $z \sim 10^{-2}$. A different statistical
analysis proposed by Pietronero is used, and it appears to be able to represent
more accurately the theoretical distribution of dust in this cosmology. In the
light of these results, it is argued that the usual practice of disregarding
relativistic effects in studies of distribution of galaxies, by considering
them as being placed on local regions, seems to be valid only on much closer
scales than it is commonly believed. In the Einstein-de Sitter cosmology with
$H_0=75 km s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, that may only happen in redshifts as low as $z
\approx 0.04$, which means that the local approximation seems to be valid up to
zeroth order of approximation only. As at present there are many redshift
surveys which have already probed at deeper ranges, it seems that in order to
compare the Friedmann models with observations we have to be very careful when
ignoring the past light cone problem in observational cosmology, either in
theoretical calculations or in data analysis, due to relativistic effects which
produce observable inhomogeneity even in spatially homogeneous cosmological
models.

of these tails is of the order of 5 tidal radii, or greater. The escaped stars
are distributed radially as a power law in density, with a slope of -4. The
tails present substructures, or clumps, that are the relics of the strongest
shocks. Due to the compressive disk-shocking, the clusters display a prolate
shape which major axis is precessing around the z axis. The tails are
preferentially formed by the lowest mass stars, as expected, so that the tidal
truncation increases mass segregation. Internal rotation of the cluster
increases the mass loss. The flattening of dark matter cannot influence
significantly the dynamics of the clusters. The orientation and the strength of
the tidal tails are signatures of the last disk crossing, so that observed
tidal tails can constrain strongly the cluster orbit and the galactic model

morphology in both galaxies varies strongly with wavelength, due to a
combination of extinction, hot dust and red supergiants, and the age of the
stellar populations. The near-infrared and radio morphologies are in general
agreement, although there are differences in the detailed morphology. From the
comparison of Br_gamma and H_alpha fluxes, we derive average extinctions toward
the hot spots A_V = 1.3 for NGC 1097 and A_V = 2.1 for NGC 6574. The observed
H_2/Br_gamma ratios indicate that in both rings the main excitation mechanism
of the molecular gas is UV radiation from hot young stars, while shocks can
contribute only in a few regions. The starburst rings in both galaxies exhibit
small Br_gamma equivalent widths. Assuming a constant star formation rate with
M_u = 100 M_o results in extremely long ages (up to 1 Gyr), in disagreement

(differentially) rotating stars contain both a `wind' and a `dead' zone. We
illustrate the influence of the magnetic field topology on the wind
acceleration pattern, by varying the coronal field strength and the extent of
the dead zone. This is evident from the resulting variations in the location
and appearance of the critical curves where the wind speed equals the slow,
Alfven, and fast speed. Larger dead zones cause effective, fairly isotropic
acceleration to super-Alfvenic velocities as the polar, open field lines are
forced to fan out rapidly with radial distance. A higher field strength moves
the Alfven transition outwards. In the ecliptic, the wind outflow is clearly
modulated by the extent of the dead zone. The combined effect of a fast stellar
rotation and an equatorial `dead' zone in a bipolar field configuration can
lead to efficient thermo-centrifugal equatorial winds. Such winds show both a
strong poleward collimation and some equatorward streamline bending due to
significant toroidal field pressure at mid-latitudes. We discuss how coronal
mass ejections are then simulated on top of the transonic outflows.

central 100-200 pc become more rapidly redder. We attribute the high central
colour indices to a central concentration of dust. We infer an average
extinction at the center of A_V = 0.6 - 1.0 mag. Several objects show central
dust rings or disks at sub-kpc scales similar to those found by others in giant
ellipticals. For galactic bulges of types S0 to Sb, the tightness of the B-I vs
I-H relation suggests that the age spread among bulges of early type galaxies
is small, of at most 2 Gyr. Colours at 1 R_eff, where we expect extinction to
be negligible are similar to than those of elliptical galaxies in the Coma
cluster, suggesting that these bulges formed at the same time as the bright
galaxies in Coma. Furthermore the galaxy ages are found to be independent of
their environment. Since it is likely that Coma was formed at redshift z > 3,
our bulges, which are in groups and in the field, also must have been formed at
this epoch. Bulges of early-type spirals cannot be formed by secular evolution
of bars at recent epochs, since such bulges would be much younger. There are
three galaxies of type Sbc and later, their bulges are younger and could
perhaps arise from secular evolution of transient bars. Our results are in good
agreement with semi-analytic predictions (Baugh et al. 1996, 1998, Kauffmann

those of QPOs found recently in the LMXB dippers 4U 1323-62, and EXO 0748-676,
which makes 4U 1746-37 the third source known to exhibit this type of QPOs. We
present evidence for X-ray spectral changes in this source similar to those
observed in LMXBs referred to as atoll sources. We detect two states, a low
intensity and spectrally hard state, and a higher intensity and spectrally soft
state. This may explain the different spectral characteristics reported for 4U
1746-37 earlier. The high intensity state resembles the banana branch state of
atoll sources. The QPOs are only seen in the low intensity state, and are
absent when the source is in the banana branch. This strongly suggests that
either the accretion disk or an extended central source change shape between
the low intensity state and the banana branch. Twelve bursts were detected, of
which 5 took place while the source was on the banana branch and 7 when the
source was in the low intensity state. The bursts occurring on the banana
branch had an e-folding time ~3 times longer than those which occurred in the
low intensity state. Whereas previously detected dips showed only a decrease in
count rate of ~15%, we found in one observation a dip in which the count rate
dropped from ~200 counts per second to ~20 counts per second. This dip lasted
only ~250 seconds, during which clear spectral hardening occured. This is the

rectangular billiard, on the other hand, displays nonuniversal distribution
with a central peak related to partial order of nodal points for the case of
symmetric attachment of leads. However cases with nonsymmetric leads tend to
the universal form.
  Also it is shown how nodal points in rectangular billiard can lead to
""channeling of quantum flows"" while disorder in nodal points in the Sinai

limit extends the dinamical mean field concept to the case of a chain embedded
in a self-consistent medium. The system flows to a Fermi-liquid fixed point for
energies below the dimensional crossover temperature, and the anomalous
exponent $\al$ renormalizes to zero, in the case of equal spin and charge
velocities. In particular, the single-particle spectral function shows sharp
quasiparticle peaks with nonvanishing weight along the whole Fermi surface, in

phase, the compressibility follows the mean-field Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and
is found to be spatially homogeneous. In the insulating phase it deviates by
more than an order of magnitude from the HF predictions and is spatially
inhomogeneous. The crossover density between the two types of behavior, agrees
quantitatively with the transport critical density, suggesting that the system
undergoes a thermodynamic change at the transition.

find that the \rho-meson EDM induced purely by the EDMs of quarks is smaller,

quark model. However, the chromoelectric dipole moments, including that of the
strange quark, give comparable and sometimes larger contributions. We also
consider the effect on the hadronic EDM of the existence of Peccei-Quinn
symmetry. When this symmetry is active, chromoelectric dipole moments induce a
linear term in the axion potential which leads to a numerically important

alike with its lovely evaluations. Much the same can be said for Euler sums (or
multiple harmonic sums), which, within the past decade, have arisen in
combinatorics, knot theory and high-energy physics. More recently, we have been
forced to consider multidimensional extensions encompassing the classical
polylogarithm, Euler sums, and the Riemann zeta function. Here, we provide a
general framework within which previously isolated results can now be properly
understood. Applying the theory developed herein, we prove several previously
conjectured evaluations, including an intriguing conjecture of Don Zagier.

SL(V_p)$ on nondegenerate multidimensional complex matrices $A\in\P
(V_0\otimes...\otimes V_p)$ of boundary format(in the sense of Gelfand,
Kapranov and Zelevinsky); in particular we characterize the non stable ones,as
the matrices which are in the orbit of a ""triangular"" matrix, and the matrices
with a stabilizer containing $\C^*$, as those which are in the orbit of a
""diagonal"" matrix. For $p=2$ it turns out that a non degenerate matrix $A\in\P
(V_0\otimes V_1\otimes V_2)$ detects a Steiner bundle $S_A$ (in the sense of
Dolgachev and Kapranov) on the projective space $\P^{n}, n = dim (V_2)-1$. As a
consequence we prove that the symmetry group of a Steiner bundle is contained
in SL(2) and that the SL(2)-invariant Steiner bundles are exactly the bundles
introduced by Schwarzenberger [Schw], which correspond to ""identity"" matrices.
We can characterize the points of the moduli space of Steiner bundles which are
stable for the action of $Aut(\P^n)$, answering in the first nontrivial case a
question posed by Simpson.
  In the opposite direction we obtain some results about Steiner bundles which
imply properties of matrices. For example the number of unstable hyperplanes of
$S_A$ (counting multiplicities) produces an interesting discrete invariant of
$A$, which can take the values $0, 1, 2, ... ,\dim~V_0+1$ or $ \infty$; the
$\infty$ case occurs if and only if $S_A$ is Schwarzenberger (and $A$ is an
identity).
  Finally, the Gale transform for Steiner bundles introduced by Dolgachev and
Kapranov under the classical name of association can be understood in this
setting as the transposition operator on multidimensional matrices.

exhibits an exponential shape with an inverse slope of

of the hard photon production is attributed to a strong increase in the

doubly-strange dibaryons not stable against strong decay if they lie within a
few MeV of threshold. Furthermore, since the dominant component of these states
is a superposition of two color-octet clusters which can be produced
intermediately in a color-deconfined quark-gluon plasma (QGP), an enhanced
production of dibaryon resonances could be a signal of QGP formation. A total
of eight, doubly-strange dibaryon states are considered for experimental search
using the STAR detector (Solenoidal Tracker at RHIC) at the new Relativistic
Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). These states may decay to Lambda-Lambda and/or
proton-Cascade-minus, depending on the resonance energy. STAR's large
acceptance, precision tracking and vertex reconstruction capabilities, and
large data volume capacity, make it an ideal instrument to use for such a
search. Detector performance and analysis sensitivity are studied as a function
of resonance production rate and width for one particular dibaryon which can
directly strong decay to proton-Cascade-minus but not Lambda-Lambda. Results
indicate that such resonances may be discovered using STAR if the resonance
production rates are comparable to coalescence model predictions for dibaryon
bound states.

thiolated conjugated molecules as electrical connectors. A qubit is encoded in
the ground state of a quantum dot spin-split by the Rashba interaction.
Arbitrary qubit rotations are effected by bringing the spin splitting energy in
a target quantum dot in resonance with a global ac magnetic field by applying a
potential pulse of appropriate amplitude and duration to the dot. The
controlled dynamics of the 2-qubit controlled-NOT operation (XOR) can be
realized by exploiting the exchange coupling with the nearest neighboring dot.
