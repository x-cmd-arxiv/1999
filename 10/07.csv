source in Cassiopeia A (Cas A) supernova remnant. This detection was
subsequently confirmed by the analyses of the archival data from both ROSAT and
Einstein observations. Here we compare the results from these observations with
the scenarios involving both black holes (BH) and neutron stars (NS). If this
point source is a BH we offer as a promising model a disk-corona type model
with low accretion rate where a soft photon source at ~ 0.1 keV is Comptonized
by higher energy electrons in the corona. If it is a NS the dominant radiation
observed by Chandra most likely originates from smaller, hotter regions of the
stellar surface, but we argue that it is still worthwhile to compare the cooler
component from the rest of the surface with cooling theories. We emphasize that
the detection of this point source itself should potentially provide enormous
impacts on the theories of supernova explosion, progenitor scenario, compact
remnant formation, accretion to compact objects, and neutron star thermal
evolution.

and the associated narrow-line component of H-alpha present the appearance of
twin H-alpha peaks. Second, the redshift of 0.2110 brings H-beta into
coincidence with Na I D at zero redshift, and ISM absorption in Na I D divides
the H-beta emission line. In spectra obtained over the past decade, we see no
substantial change in the character of the line profiles, and no indication of
intrinsic double-peaked structure. The H-gamma, Mg II, and Ly-alpha emission
lines are single peaked, and all of the emission-line redshifts are consistent

radial zones, out to 2.3 arcsec in projected position to the southwest of the

reddening correction, the calculated line ratios successfully matched nearly
all the dereddened ratios. We find that the narrow-line region consists of
dusty atomic gas photoionized by a power-law continuum that has been modified
by transmission through a mix of low and high ionization gas, specifically UV
and X-ray absorbing components. The physical characteristics of the absorbers
resemble those observed along our line of sight to the nucleus, although the
column density of the X-ray absorber is a factor of ten less than observed. The
large inferred covering factor of the absorbing gas is in agreement with the
results of our previous study of UV absorption in Seyfert 1 galaxies. We find
evidence, specifically the suppression of L-alpha, that we are observing the
back-end of dusty ionized clouds in the region southwest of the nucleus. Since
these clouds are blueshifted, this supports the interpretation of the cloud
kinematics as being due to radial outflow from the nucleus. We find that the
narrow-line gas at each radial position is inhomogeneous, and can be modeled as
consisting of a radiation-bounded component and a more tenuous, matter-bounded
component. The density of the narrow-line gas dropswith increasing radial

accounted for by radio-quiet quasars, allowing us to derive an upper limit of 4
\bgunit\ for the remaining background at 0.25 keV. However, the XRB from the
gas halos of groups of galaxies, with gas removal due to cooling accounted for,
exceeds this upper limit by an order of magnitude if non-gravitational heating
is not included. We calculate this using simulations of halo merger trees and
realistic gas density profiles, which we require to reproduce the observed gas
fractions and abundances of X-ray clusters. In addition, we find that the
entire mass range of groups, from $\sim 5\times 10^{12}$ to $\sim 10^{14}$\Ms,
contributes to the 0.25 keV background in this case. In a further study, we
reduce the luminosities of groups by maximally heating their gas halos while
maintaining the same gas fractions. This only reduces the XRB by a factor of 2
or less. We thus argue that most of the gas associated with groups must be
outside their virial radii. This conclusion is supported by X-ray studies of
individual groups. The properties of both groups and X-ray clusters can be
naturally explained by a model in which the gas is given excess specific
energies of $\sim 1$ keV/particle by non-gravitational heating. With this
excess energy, the gas is gravitationally unbound from groups, but recollapses
with the formation of a cluster of temperature $\ga 1$ keV. This is similar to
a model proposed by Pen, but is contrary to the evolution of baryons described
by Cen \& Ostriker. (abridged)

ion densities, we are able to match the absolute flux of hydrogen in the ACRs
by assuming that pickup ion scattering mean free paths, at the termination
shock, are much less than an AU and that moderately strong cross-field
diffusion occurs. Simultaneously, we match the flux ratios He$^{+}$/H$^+$ or
O$^{+}$/H$^+$ to within a factor ~ 3. If the conditions of strong scattering

propose that when the proportion of refractory elements locked up in dust

approximately uniform level of depletion for all grain constituents and, by
applying a small dust correction, recover the intrisic abundances of Si and Mn.
We use this approach on a small sample of damped systems for which it is
appropriate, with the aim of comparing the metallicity dependence of the ratios
[Si/Fe] and [Mn/Fe] with analogous measurements in Milky Way stars. The main
conclusion is that the relative abundances of both elements in distant galaxies
are broadly in line with expectations based on Galactic data. Si displays a
mild enhancement at low metallicities, as expected for an alpha-capture
element, but there are also examples of near-solar [Si/Fe] at [Fe/H] < -1. The
underabundance of Mn at low metallicities is possibly even more pronounced than
that in metal-poor stars, and no absorption system has yet been found where
[Mn/Fe] is solar. The heterogeneous chemical properties of damped Lyman alpha

the gas phase. The principal pattern of selective depletions is the depletion
of sulfur-bearing molecules relative to nitrogen-bearing species: NH3 and N2H+.
This pattern is shown to be insensitive to the details of the dynamics and
marginally sensitive to whether the grain mantle is dominated by polar or
non-polar molecules. Based on these results we suggest that molecular ions are
good tracers of collapsing envelopes. The effects of coupling chemistry and
dynamics on the resulting physical evolution are also examined. Particular
attention is paid to comparisons between models and observations.

are reached in models where (i) the local spectrum shape of density

The formalism is then applied to estimate the skewness of the publicly

and with isotropy. Inclusion of non Gaussian degrees of freedom has essentially
no effect on estimates of the power spectrum, if each $C_\ell$ is regarded as a

an amplitude (Q) and spectral index (n). Fixing the value of the angular power
spectrum at its maxiumum likelihood estimate, the best fit skewness is
$S=6.5\pm6.0\times10^4(\muK)^3$; marginalizing over Q the estimate of the

vertical morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) around x=0.45-0.50. Recent
synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction measurements by Noheda et al. [Appl. Phys.
Lett. 74, 2059 (1999)] have revealed a new monoclinic phase between the
previously-established tetragonal and rhombohedral regions. In the present work
we describe a Rietveld analysis of the detailed structure of the tetragonal and
monoclinic PZT phases on a sample with x= 0.48 for which the lattice parameters
are respectively: at= 4.044 A, ct= 4.138 A, at 325 K, and am= 5.721 A, bm=
5.708 A, cm= 4.138 A, beta= 90.496 deg., at 20K. In the tetragonal phase the
shifts of the atoms along the polar [001] direction are similar to those in
PbTiO3 but the refinement indicates that there are, in addition, local
disordered shifts of the Pb atoms of ~0.2 A perpendicular to the polar axis..
The monoclinic structure can be viewed as a condensation along one of the <110>
directions of the local displacements present in the tetragonal phase. It
equally well corresponds to a freezing-out of the local displacements along one
of the <100> directions recently reported by Corker et al.[J. Phys. Condens.

therefore provides a microscopic picture of the MPB region in which one of the

structures freezes out, and thus represents a bridge between these two phases.

the AC amplitude of the excitation field, $h_{AC}$, and the external magnetic

the multi-junction loops, which manifests itself as a reentrant screening at
low temperature, for values of $h_{AC}$ higher than 50 mOe. A highly simplified
model, based on a single loop containing four junction, accounts for this
paramagnetic contribution and the range of parameters in which it appears. This
model offers an alternative explanation of PME which does not involve

Chaos 9(3) (in press, 1999)",,"10.1063/1.166441",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  When dissipative particles are left alone, their fluctuation energy decays
due to collisional interactions, clusters build up and grow with time until the
system size is reached. When the effective dissipation is strong enough, this
may lead to the `inelastic collapse', i.e. the divergence of the collision
frequency of some particles. The cluster growth is an interesting physical
phenomenon, whereas the inelastic collapse is an intrinsic effect of the
inelastic hard sphere (IHS) model used to study the cluster growth - involving
only a negligible number of particles in the system. Here, we extend the IHS
model by introducing an elastic contact energy and the related contact duration
t_c. This avoids the inelastic collapse and allows to examine the long-time
behavior of the system. For a quantitative description of the cluster growth,
we propose a burning - like algorithm in continuous space, that readily
identifies all particles that belong to the same cluster. The criterion for
this is here chosen to be only the particle distance.
  With this method we identify three regimes of behavior. First, for short
times a homogeneous cooling state (HCS) exists, where a mean-field theory works
nicely, and the clusters are tiny and grow very slowly. Second, at a certain
time which depends on the system's properties, cluster growth starts and the
clusters increase in size and mass until, in the third regime, the system size
is reached and most of the particles are collected in one huge cluster.

show here that the analysis reported in gr-qc/9909017 is incorrect. Whereas
Salecker and Wigner sought an operative definition of distances suitable for

that appear to be natural in the context of most present-day experiments but
are not even meaningful in the Planck regime. Moreover, contrary to the claim
made in gr-qc/9909017, a relevant quantum uncertainty which is used in the

only be traded for another comparable contribution to the total uncertainty in

in my recent proposal of interferometry-based tests of quantum properties of

motivated by the Salecker-Wigner limit. The bulk of the insight we can expect

investigated. This calorimeter uses a unique longitudinal configuration of
scintillator tiles. Using a fine-grained pion beam scan at 100 GeV, a detailed
picture of transverse shower behavior is obtained. The underlying radial energy
densities for four depth segments and for the entire calorimeter have been
reconstructed. A three-dimensional hadronic shower parametrization has been
developed. The results presented here are useful for understanding the
performance of iron-scintillator calorimeters, for developing fast simulations
of hadronic showers, for many calorimetry problems requiring the integration of
a shower energy deposition in a volume and for future calorimeter design.

Compton scattering amplitude and using LF current commutators. We worked in the
LF gauge $A^+=0$ and used the old-fashioned LFQCD perturbation theory in our
calculations. The importance of our work are summarized below.
  Our approach shares the intution of parton model and addresses directly the
structure functions, which are experimental objects, instead of its moments as
in OPE method. Moreover, it can potentially incorporate the non-perturbative
contents of the structure functions as we have demonstrated by introducing a
new factorization scheme.
  In the context of nucleonic helicity structure, the well known gauge fixed LF
helicity operator is shown to provide consistent physical information and helps
us defining new relevant structure functions. The anomalous dimensions relevant
for the $Q^2$-evolution of such structure functions are calculated.
  Our study is important in establishing the equivalance of LF field theory and
the usual equal-time one through perturbative calculations of the dressed
parton structure functions reproducing the well known results. Also the
importance of Gallilean boost symmetry in understanding the correctness of any
higher order calculation using ($x^+$)-ordered LFQCD perturbation theory are

a variety of potential terms, i.e., nonderivative interactions, for the

to other models in kinetic theory (2-dimensional symmetric Vlasov-Poisson
system with an external magnetic field), in fluid dynamics (Euler system for
gases) and in quantum physics (Schr\""odinger-Poisson system, nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation).

arithmetic group possesses a normal subgroup of finite index without
$p'$-torsion). We define the cohomology of $\Gamma $ with compact supports and
values in ${\Bbb Z}[1/p]$, and we relate it to spaces of harmonic cocycles,
also with compact supports (\S 3). We give a description of the locus of these
supports, in particular by introducing a notion of cusp in dimension $n\geq 1$
(\S 4) and we calculate ""geometrically"" the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic of
this cohomology, up to torsion (\S 5).

inside a medium are studied. The motion is manifestly relativistic and may be
produced by a constant uniform electric field. It is shown that in addition to
the bremsstrahlung and Cherenkov shock waves, the electromagnetic shock wave
arises when the charge particle velocity coincides with the light velocity in
the medium. For the accelerated motion this shock wave forming an indivisible
entity with the Cherenkov shock wave arrives after the arrival of the
bremsstrahlung shock wave. For the decelerated motion the above shock wave
detaches from the charge at the moment when its velocity coincides with the
light velocity in the medium. This wave existing even after termination of the
charge motion of the charge propagates with the light velocity in the medium.
It has the same singularity as the Cherenkov shock and is more singular than
the bremsstrahlung shock wave. The space-time regions, where these shock waves
exist, and conditions under which they can be observed are determined.

processes off the deuteron, 2H(e, e'N)X, is a very promising tool for the
extraction of model-independent information on the neutron structure function

the semi-inclusive cross section, which holds in the deep-inelastic regime as
well as in the nucleon-resonance production regions. Moreover, the possibility
to get unique information on the neutron asymmetry A1n(x, Q**2) from polarised
2H_pol(e_pol, e'N)X processes is illustrated.

positron + neutrino, is recalculated in the relativistic field theory model of
the deuteron (RFMD). We obtain S_pp(0) = 4.08 x 10^{-25} MeV b which agrees
good with the recommended value S_pp(0) = 4.00 x 10^{-25} MeV b. The amplitude
of low-energy elastic proton-proton (pp) scattering in the singlet S-wave state
with the Coulomb repulsion contributing to the amplitude of the solar proton
burning is described in terms of the S-wave scattering length and the effective
range. This takes away the problem pointed out by Bahcall and Kamionkowski
(Nucl. Phys. A625 (1997) 893) that in the RFMD one cannot describe low-energy
elastic pp scattering with the Coulomb repulsion in agreement with low-energy
nuclear phenomenology. The cross section for the neutrino disintegration of the
deuteron, neutrino + D -> electron + p + p, is calculated with respect to
S_pp(0) for neutrino energies from threshold to 10 MeV. The results can be used
for the analysis of the data which will be obtained in the experiments planned
by SNO. The astrophysical factor S_pep(0) for the pep process, p + electron + p
-> neutrino + D, is calculated relative to S_pp(0) in complete agreement with
the result obtained by Bahcall and May (ApJ. 155 (1969) 501).
