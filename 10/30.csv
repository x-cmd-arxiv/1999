obtained by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS); the spectra cover
the wavelength range 1150 - 10,270 Angstroms at a spatial resolution of 0.05 -
0.1 arcsec and a spectral resolving power of 1000. In this first paper, we
concentrate on the far-UV to near-IR continuum emission from the continuum
``hot spot'' and surrounding regions extending out to +/- 6 arcsec (+/-432 pc)
at a position angle of 202 degrees In addition to the broad emission lines
detected by spectropolarimetry, the hot spot shows the ``little blue bump'' in
the 2000 - 4000 Ang. range, which is due to Fe II and Balmer continuum
emission. The continuum shape of the hot spot is indistinguishable from that of
NGC 4151 and other Seyfert 1 galaxies. Thus, the hot spot is reflected emission
from the hidden nucleus, due to electron scattering (as opposed to
wavelength-dependent dust scattering). The hot spot is ~0.3 arcsec in extent
and accounts for 20% of the scattered light in the inner 500 pc. We are able to
deconvolve the extended continuum emission in this region into two components:
electron-scattered light from the hidden nucleus (which dominates in the UV)
and stellar light (which dominates in the optical and near-IR). The scattered
light is heavily concentrated towards the hot spot, is stronger in the
northeast, and is enhanced in regions of strong narrow-line emission. The
stellar component is more extended, concentrated southwest of the hot spot,
dominated by an old (> 2 x 10 Gyr) stellar population, and includes a nuclear
stellar cluster which is ~200 pc in extent.

inner narrow line region (NLR) of the Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 1068. Spectra were
taken with HST/STIS through the 0.1X52 arcsec slit, covering the full STIS 1200
to 10000 Angstrom waveband, and are from a region that includes the hot spot,
extending 0.2, or ~ 14 pc (for H= 75 km/sec/Mpc). Perhaps the most striking
feature of these spectra is the presence of strong coronal emission lines,
including [S XII] 7611 which has hitherto only been identified in spectra of
the solar corona. There is an apparent correlation between ionization energy
and velocity of the emission lines with respect to the systemic velocity of the
host galaxy, with the coronal lines blueshifted, most other high excitation
lines near systemic, and some of the low ionization lines redshifted. From the
results of our modeling, we find that the emission-line gas consists of three
principal components: 1) one in which most of the strong emission-lines, such
as [O III] 5007, [Ne V] 3426, C IV 1550, arise, 2) a more tenuous, highly
ionized component, which is the source of the coronal-line emission, and 3) a
component, which is not co-planar with the other two, in which the low
ionization and neutral lines, such as [N II] 6548 and [O I] 6300, are formed.
The first two components are directly ionized by the EUV-Xray continuum emitted
by the central source, while the low ionization gas is ionized by a combination
of highly absorbed continuum radiation and a small fraction of unabsorbed
continuum scattered by free electrons associated with the hot spot. The
combination of covering factor and Thomson optical depth of the high ionization
components is insufficient to scatter the observed fraction of continuum
radiation into our line-of-sight.

  Internal examiner Prof M. Edmunds (Cardiff); External Dr C. Tadhunter
  (Sheffield)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  This thesis reports the K-band polarizations of a representative sample of
nine radio galaxies: seven 3C objects at 0.7 < z < 1.3, and two other
distinctive sources. Careful consideration is given to the accurate measurement
and `debiasing' of faint polarizations, with recommendations for the function
of polarimetric software. 3C 22 and 3C 41 both have 3% polarization
perpendicular to their radio structures, consistent with suggestions that they
may be obscured quasars. 3C 54 is polarized at 6%, parallel to its radio
structure. 3C 65 and 3C 356 are faint: the noisy measurements give no firm
evidence for polarization. MRC 0156-252 at z~2 is found to be unpolarized in K.
3C 114 has a complex structure of four bright knots, one offset from the radio
structure and three along the axis. There is strong evidence for polarization
in the source as a whole (12%) and the brightest knot (5%). 3C 441 lies in a
rich field; one of its companions appears to be 18% polarized. The
identification of the knot containing the active nucleus has been disputed, and
is discussed. LBDS 53W091 was controversially reported to have a 40% H-band
polarization. No firm evidence is found for non-zero K-band polarization in
53W091, though there is some evidence for its companion being polarized. The
object is discussed in the context of other radio-weak galaxies.
  Simple spectral and spatial models for polarization in radio galaxies are
discussed and used to interpret the measurements. The important cosmological
question of the fraction of K-band light arising in radio galaxy nuclei is
considered: in particular, the contribution of scattered nuclear light to the
total K-band emission is estimated to be of order 7% in 3C 22 and 3C 41, 26% in
3C 114, and tentatively 25% or more in 3C 356.

halo lensing optical depth varies over the face of M31 depending on the shape
of the microlensing halo, and show how this shape could be determined in
representative results from a simulated survey in which roughly one-half square
degree is imaged for six hours every three nights on a two-meter telescope, in

in this model can either trade at the market price or place a limit order, i.e.
an instruction to buy (sell) a certain amount of the stock if its price falls
below (raises above) a predefined level. The choice between these two options
is purely random (there are no strategies involved), and the execution price of
a limit order is determined simply by offsetting the most recent market price
by a random amount. Numerical simulations of this model revealed that despite
such minimalistic rules the price pattern generated by the model has such
realistic features as ``fat'' tails of the price fluctuations distribution,
characterized by a crossover between two power law exponents, long range
correlations of the volatility, and a non-trivial Hurst exponent of the price
signal.

frame operators of Weyl-Heisenberg systems and shift-invariant systems, and
relate these to the convergence of the Walnut representation. We give a deep
analysis of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for convergence of
the frame operator. We show that symmetric, norm and unconditional convergence
of the Walnut series are all different, but that weak and norm convergence are
the same, while there are WH-systems for which the Walnut representation has
none of these convergence properties. We make a detailed study of the
CC-Condition (a sufficient condition for WH-systems to have finite upper frame
bounds), and show that (for ab rational) a uniform version of this passes to
the Wexler-Raz dual. We also show that a condition of Tolimieri and Orr implies
the uniform CC-Condition. We obtain stronger results in the case when (g,a,b)
is a WH-system and ab is rational. For example, if ab is rational, then the
CC-Condition becomes equivalent to the unconditional convergence of the Walnut
representation - even in a more general setting. Many of the results are
generalized to shift-invariant systems. We give classifications for numerous
important classes of WH-systems including: (1) The WH-systems for which the
frame operator extends to a bounded operator on L^p(R), 1\leq p; (2) The
WH-systems for which the frame operator extends to a bounded operator on the
Wiener amalgam space; (3) The families of frames which have the same frame

studies knots that are transversal to the standard contact structure in
$\reals^3$, bringing techniques from topological knot theory to bear on their
transversal classification. We say that a transversal knot type $\cTK$ is {\it
transversally simple} if it is determined by its topological knot type $\cK$
and its Bennequin number. The main theorem asserts that any $\cTK$ whose
associated $\cK$ satisfies a condition that we call {\em exchange reducibility}
is transversally simple.
  As a first application, we prove that the unlink is transversally simple,
extending the main theorem in \cite{El}. As a second application we use a new
theorem of Menasco (Theorem 1 of \cite{Me}) to extend a result of Etnyre
\cite{Et} to prove that iterated torus knots are transversally simple. We also
give a formula for their maximum Bennequin number. We show that the concept of
exchange reducibility is the simplest of the constraints that one can place on
$\cK$ in order to prove that any associated $\cTK$ is transversally simple. We
also give examples of pairs of transversal knots that we conjecture are {\em
not} transversally simple.

tunes do not contribute to the higher order tune splitting, the seperation of
the tunes, as they shift the two tunes about equally.This results in a lack of
