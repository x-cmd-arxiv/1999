density environments. We show that they lie on the same fundamental plane as
early-type galaxies in both local and distant rich clusters. Their surface
brightness evolution requires a typical star formation epoch of z=2-3, almost
indistinguishable from that of rich cluster galaxies at comparable redshifts.
The restricted galaxy type range of the lenses means that photometric redshifts
work well even with only 1-3 filter photometry. We make preliminary
measurements of the mass and luminosity functions of the lens galaxies, and
find they are consistent with the standard model used for deriving cosmological
limits using lens statistics. As expected for a mass-weighted sample, they are
more massive and more luminous than the overall early-type galaxy population.

have 4 million particles within the cluster and force resolution 0.5 kpc/h
(0.05% of the virial radius). The central density profile has a logarithmic
slope of -1.5, as found in lower resolution studies of the same halo,
indicating that the profile has converged to the ``physical'' limit down to
scales of a few kpc. Also the abundance of substructure is consistent with that
derived from lower resolution runs; on the scales explored, the mass and
circular velocity functions are close to power laws of exponents ~ -1.9 and -4.
Overmerging appears to be globally unimportant for suhalos with circular
velocities > 100 km/s. We can trace most of the cluster progenitors from z=3 to
the present; the central object (the dark matter analog of a cD galaxy)is
assembled between z=3 and 1 from the merging of a dozen halos with v_circ \sim
300 km/s. The mean circular velocity of the subhalos decreases by ~ 20% over 5
billion years, due to tidal mass loss. The velocity dispersions of halos and
dark matter globally agree within 10%, but the halos are spatially anti-biased,
and, in the very central region of the cluster, they show positive velocity
bias; however, this effect appears to depend on numerical resolution.

rational bubbles a la Blanchard and Watson (1982), corresponding to
multiplicative maps, whose study has recently be revived recently in physics as
a mechanism of intermittent dynamics generating power law distributions. Using
insights on the behavior of multiplicative stochastic processes, we demonstrate
that the tails of the unconditional distribution emerging from such bubble
processes follow power-laws (exhibit hyperbolic decline). More precisely, we
find that rational bubbles predict a 'fat' power tail for both the bubble
component and price differences with an exponent smaller than 1, implying
absence of convergence of the mean. The distribution of returns is dominated by
the same power-law over an extended range of large returns. Although power-law
tails are a pervasive feature of empirical data, these numerical predictions
are in disagreement with the usual empirical estimates of an exponent between 2
and 4. It, therefore, appears that exogenous rational bubbles are hardly
reconcilable with some of the stylized facts of financial data at a very
elementary level.

remarkably simple way: <I> tau_{\phi}=C e. Here e is an electron charge, and
the constant C depends on the Dyson symmetry class. For a pure potential
disorder the current <I> is diamagnetic C = -(4/\pi) and in the presence of
strong spin-orbit scattering it is paramagnetic C =(2/\pi). The relationship
seems to agree reasonably with experiments. This suggests that the two puzzles:
anomalously large persistent current [L.P.Levy et al., Phys.Rev.Lett., v.64,

Lorentz group, common for the initial and final states,is realized. This brings
the spin operators of in- and out-particles to coincidence. The developed
approach is valid both for massive fermions and for massless ones. There occur
no problems with accounting for spin flip amplitudes in it. Just 4-momenta of
particles participating in reactions are required in it to construct the
mathematical apparatus for calculations of matrix elements. We apply this
formalism to the next processes: 1) M\""oller and Bhabha bremsstrahlung

initial particles and photon are helicity polarized; 2) Compton back-scattering
of photons of intensive circularly polarized laser wave on a beam of
longitudinally polarized ultrarelativistic electrons ($e+n\gamma_0 \to e+\gamma
$); 3) $e^+e^-$-pair production by a hard photon in simultaneous collision with
several laser beam photons ($\gamma+n \gamma_0 \to e^+ + e^-$); 4)
Bethe-Heitler process in the case of a linearly polarized photon emission by an
electron with account for proton recoil and form factors; 5) the reaction $ep

kinematics when proton bremsstrahlung dominates; 6) orthopositronium 3-photon

describing the bosonic sector of supergravities in ten and eleven dimensions

electric charge and thus inherit some of their physical properties. The most
appealing property is their quantization: in d_\perp extra dimensions,
Lambda_brane goes like N and Lambda_bulk like N^{2/(2-d_perp)}. This dynamical
origin also explains the apparent fine-tuning required in the Randall-Sundrum
scenario. In our approach, the cosmological constants are derived parameters

define on the total space of a smooth family of curves a so-called trace
complex associated to a vector bundle, the 0-th relative cohomology of which is
the Atiyah algebra of the determinant bundle. Their proof reduces the general
case to the acyclic one. In particular, one needs a comparison of the image of
the trace complex for a bundle, and its twist by an \'etale multisection. We
analyse this and correct a point in the original proof.

center-of-mass motion on the fit of effective interactions for self-consistent
nuclear mean-field calculations. We find that interactions with very simple
center-of-mass correction have significantly larger surface coefficients than
interactions for which the center-of-mass correction was calculated for the
actual many-body state during the fit. The reason for that is that the
effective interaction has to counteract the wrong trends with nucleon number of
all simplified schemes for center-of-mass correction which puts a wrong trend
with mass number into the effective interaction itself. The effect becomes
clearly visible when looking at the deformation energy of largely deformed
systems, e.g. superdeformed states or fission barriers of heavy nuclei.

performed with respect to the odd-even staggering of the binding energies. We
find that the results strongly depend on the way in which the ground states of
the odd nuclei are computed. A thorough calculation including all time-even and
time-odd polarisation effects induced by the odd nucleon produces about 30%
reduced odd-even staggering as compared to the standard spherical calculations
in the relativistic mean-field model. The pairing strength must be enhanced by
about 20% to compensate for that effect. The enhanced strength has dramatic
consequences for the predicted deformation properties of the underlying
mean-field models, possibly implying that new adjustments of their parameters
become necessary as well.

  Optics",,"10.1080/09500340008244042",,"quant-ph",,"  Quantum teleportation is one of the essential primitives of quantum
communication. We suggest that any quantum teleportation scheme can be
characterized by its efficiency, i.e. how often it succeeds to teleport, its
fidelity, i.e. how well the input state is reproduced at the output, and by its
insensitivity to cross talk, i.e. how well it rejects an input state that is
not intended to teleport. We discuss these criteria for the two teleportation
experiments of independent qubits which have been performed thus far. In the
first experiment (Nature {\bf 390},575 (1997)) where the qubit states were
various different polarization states of photons, the fidelity of teleportation
was as high as 0.80 $\pm$ 0.05 thus clearly surpassing the limit of 2/3 which
can, in principle, be obtained by a direct measurement on the qubit and
classical communication. This high fidelity is confirmed in our second
experiment (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80}, 3891 (1998)), demonstrating entanglement
swapping, that is, realizing the teleportation of a qubit which itself is still
entangled to another one. This experiment is the only one up to date that
demonstrates the teleportation of a genuine unknown quantum state.
