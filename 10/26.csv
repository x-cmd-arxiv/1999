previously been detected in a shallower survey for steep spectrum radio sources
in globular clusters (Fruchter and Goss 1990). The sixth, the rich globular
cluster, Liller 1, had heretofore been undetected in the radio, and the
seventh, 47 Tucanae, was not included in our original survey. High resolution 6
and 20 cm images of three of the clusters, NGC 6440, NGC 6539, NGC 6624 reveal
only point sources coincident with pulsars which have been discovered
subsequent to our first imaging survey. 21 and 18 cm images reveal several
point sources within a few core-radii of the center of 47 Tuc. Two of these are
identified pulsars, and a third, which is both variable and has a steep
spectrum, is also most likely a pulsar previously identified by a pulsed
survey. However, the 6, 20 and 90 cm images of NGC 6544, Liller 1 and Terzan 5
display strong steep-spectrum emission which cannot be associated with known
pulsars. The image of the rich cluster Terzan 5 displays numerous point sources
within $30''$, or 4 core radii of the cluster center. The density of these
objects rises rapidly toward the core, where an elongated region of emission is
found. The brightest individual sources, as well as the extended emission,
possess the steep spectra expected of pulsars. Furthermore, the flux
distribution of the sources agrees well with the standard pulsar luminosity
function. The total luminosity and number of objects observed suggest that
Terzan 5 contains more pulsars than any other Galactic globular cluster.

orbital period (4.18h) of RXJ1313.2-3259. This low temperature implies either
that the system is a young CV in the process of switching on mass transfer or
that it is an older CV found in a prolonged state of low accretion rate, much
below that predicted by standard evolution theory. In the first case, we can
put a lower limit on the life time as pre-CV of 10e8yrs. In the second case,
the good agreement of the white dwarf temperature with that expected from
compressional heating suggests that the system has experienced the current low
accretion rate for an extended period >10e4yrs. A possible explanation for the
low accretion rate is that RXJ1313.2-3259 is a hibernating post nova and

well below the limit for detection of individual halos, projected halo
statistics can be constrained for halo masses spanning galactic to cluster
halos. The use of peak statistics relies on an analytical model of the noise
due to the intrinsic ellipticities of source galaxies. The noise model has been
shown to accurately describe simulated data for a variety of input ellipticity
distributions. We show that the measured peak distribution has distinct
signatures of gravitational lensing, and its non-Gaussian shape can be used to
distinguish models with different values of Omega. The use of peak statistics
is complementary to the measurement of field statistics, such as the

some unique characteristics. Contrary to all other methods which favour nearby
objects, microlensing is sensitive to planets around stars at distances of
several kpc. These stars act as gravitational lenses leading to a brightening
of observed luminous source stars. The lens stars that are tested for the
presence of planets are not generally seen themselves. The largest sensitivity
is obtained for planets at orbital separations of 1-10 AU offering the view on
an extremely interesting range with regard to our own solar system and in
particular to the position of Jupiter. The microlensing signal of a
jupiter-mass planet lasts typically a few days. This means that a planet
reveals its existence by producing a short signal at its quasi-instantaneous
position, so that planets can be detected without the need to observe a
significant fraction of the orbital period. Relying on the microlensing alerts
issued by several survey groups that observe ~10^7 stars in the Galactic bulge,
PLANET (Probing Lensing Anomalies NETwork) performs precise and frequent
measurements on ongoing microlensing events in order to detect deviations from
a light curve produced by a single point-like object. These measurements allow
constraints to be put on the abundance of planets. From 42 well-sampled events
between 1995 and 1999, we infer that less than 1/3 of M-dwarfs in the Galactic
bulge have jupiter-mass companions at separations between 1 and 4 AU from their
parent star, and that less than 45% have 3-jupiter-mass companions between 1
and 7 AU.

(z<0.12) radio galaxies extracted from two radio flux limited samples of radio
sources. All objects are imaged in the R band and for a subsample we have also
obtained B band images. The sample includes sources of both FRI and FRII radio
morphological type. Through the decomposition of the luminosity profiles and
the analysis of the structural profiles (ellipticity, PA, c4) of the galaxies
we are able to characterize in detail the optical properties of the radio
galaxies. The average absolute magnitude is M_HOST(tot)=-24.0 with a clear
trend for FRI sources to be 0.5 mag brighter than FRII galaxies. In about 40%
of the objects observed we find an excess of light in the nucleus that is
attributed to the presence of a nuclear point source whose luminosity is on
average 1-2% of the total flux of the host galaxy. The luminosity of these
nuclear point sources appears correlated with the core radio power of the
galaxies. Radio galaxies follow the same mu_e - R_e relationship as normal
elliptical galaxies. The distribution of ellipticity, the amount of twisting
and shape of isophotes (boxy,disky) do not differ significantly from other
ellipticals. The evidence for recent interactions is therefore rather modest.
Finally on average radio galaxies are bluer and have a color dispersion larger
than normal elliptical galaxies, and the average color gradient in radio
galaxies appears slightly steeper than in normal ellipticals. These results
support a scenario where radio emission is weakly related with the overall
properties and/or the activity have negligible effects on the global
characteristics of the host galaxy.

in the field of six cluster candidates from the ESO Imaging Survey (EIS). The
cluster candidates were selected in the EIS patches C and D and have estimated
mean redshifts between z=0.5 and z=0.7.
  In the six candidate cluster fields, we identify possible systems of galaxies
in the redshift space. The likelihoods of these systems are established by
comparison with random resamplings of the Canada-France Redshift Surveys, and
using the redshift distribution expected from Postman et al.'s luminosity
function, with Poggianti's K- and evolutionary-corrections.
  Four of the six candidate EIS clusters are found to correspond to a real
system in the redshift space, with > 95 % probability. Two of them have a mean
redshift in agreement with the estimate from the matched filter algorithm,
while the other two have a significantly smaller redshift.
  The independent analysis of the V-I vs. I color-magnitude diagrams for five
of our six cluster fields, supports our conclusions based on the spectroscopic
data.

off-center transition point, rather than from a spherical transition shell, is
described and simulated. The differences between the results of 2D simulations
and the 1D case are presented and discussed. The two dimensional effects become
significant in transition density below 3.e7 g/cm^3, where the energetics, the
production of Fe group elements and the symmetry of the explosion are all
affected. In the 2D case the explosion is less energetic and less Ni is
produced in the detonation phase of the explosion. For low transition density
the reduction in Ni mass can reach 20-30 percent. The asymmetry in abundances
between regions close to the transition point and regions far from that point
is large, and could be a source to polarization patterns in the emitted light.
We conclude that the spatial and temporal distribution of transition locations,
is an important parameter which must be included in delayed detonation models
for Type Ia supernovae. \

electrons is attractive. A weak attraction should manifest itself strongly in
1D systems, since it can create two-electron bound states. This paper
interprets the 0.7 $(2e^2/h)$ conductance structure, observed recently in a
one-dimensional constriction, as a manifestation of two-electron bound states
formed in a barrier saddle-point. The value 0.75 $(2e^2/h)$ follows naturally
from the 3:1 triplet-singlet statistical weight ratio for the two-electron
bound states, if the triplet energy is lower. Furthermore, the value 0.75 has
to be multiplied by the probability T of the bound state formation during
adiabatic transmission of two electrons into 1D channel ($T\simeq 1$). If the
binding energy is larger than the sub-band energy spacing the 0.7 structure can
be seen even when the integer steps are smeared away by the temperature. Bound
states of several electrons, if they exist, may give different steps at 1/2,
5/16, 3/16 etc in the conductance. The latter results are sensitive to the
length of 1D system and the electron density at the barrier. It is not excluded
that the fractional conductance quantization may also appear for a repulsive
interaction between electrons. In this case the electron level splitting is due
to the exchange interaction with two nearest neighbors in a 1D Wigner crystal.

characterised in the linear regime by a stretched exponential stress
relaxation. We analyse this relaxation in the light of classical theories of
transient networks. The role of the elastic reorganisations in the deformed
network is emphasized. In the non linear regime, a fast relaxation dynamics is
followed by a second one having the same rate as in the linear regime. This
behaviour, under step strain experiments, should induce a non monotonic
behaviour in the elastic component of the stress under constant shear rate.
However, we obtain in this case a singularity in the flow curve very different
from the one observed in other systems, that we interpret in terms of fracture
behaviour.

the Zeeman effect of the field, we study the orbital effects, using the

We argue that the orbital effect is qualitatively different for in-plane and
inter-layer mechanisms for superconductivity. In the case of in-plane
mechanisms, interlayer couplings may be modeled as a weak interlayer Josephson
coupling, whose effects disappear as $H\to\infty$; in this case Zeeman
dominates the effect of the field. In contrast, in the inter-layer mechanism
the Josephson coupling {\em is} the driving force of superconductivity, and we
argue that the in-plane field suppresses superconductivity and provides an
upper bound for $H_{c2}$ which we estimate very crudely.

support systems. These complex queries often have a lot of common
sub-expressions, either within a single query, or across multiple such queries
run as a batch. Multi-query optimization aims at exploiting common
sub-expressions to reduce evaluation cost. Multi-query optimization has
hither-to been viewed as impractical, since earlier algorithms were exhaustive,
and explore a doubly exponential search space.
  In this paper we demonstrate that multi-query optimization using heuristics
is practical, and provides significant benefits. We propose three cost-based
heuristic algorithms: Volcano-SH and Volcano-RU, which are based on simple
modifications to the Volcano search strategy, and a greedy heuristic. Our
greedy heuristic incorporates novel optimizations that improve efficiency
greatly. Our algorithms are designed to be easily added to existing optimizers.
We present a performance study comparing the algorithms, using workloads
consisting of queries from the TPC-D benchmark. The study shows that our
algorithms provide significant benefits over traditional optimization, at a
very acceptable overhead in optimization time.

notes emphasize those aspects that are most relevant to the questions that come
to mind when one is exposed for the first time to these research developments:
How come theory and experiments are finally meeting in spite of all the gloomy
forecasts that pervade traditional reviews? Is this a case of theorists having
put forward more and more speculative ideas until a point was reached at which
conventional experiments could rule out the proposed phenomena? Or has there
been such a remarkable improvement in experimental techniques and ideas that we
are now capable of testing plausible candidate quantum-gravity phenomena? These
questions are analysed rather carefully for the recent proposals of
interferometry-based tests and tests using observations of gamma rays of
astrophysical origin. I also briefly discuss other proposed experiments
(including tests of quantum-gravity-induced decoherence using the neutral-kaon
system and accelerator tests of models with large extra dimensions). The
emerging picture suggests that we are finally starting the exploration of a
large class of plausible quantum-gravity effects. However, our chances to
obtain positive (discovery) experimental results depend crucially on the
magnitude of these effects. In most cases the level of sensitivity that the
relevant experiments should achieve within a few years corresponds to effects
suppressed only linearly by the Planck length.

fractal basin boundary separating the possible outcomes of the orbits (escape

distances, the basin boundary becomes a self-similar Cantor set, and we find

the vacuum term which cancels the induced one at some point in the very far
infrared cosmic scale. Starting from this point we investigate whether the
cancellation is preserved at different energy scales. We find that the running
of the Higgs mass, couplings and the vacuum term inevitably result in a scaling
dependence of the observable CC value. As a consequence one meets a nonzero CC
at an energy scale comparable to the typical electron neutrino mass suggested
by some experiments, and the order of magnitude of this constant is roughly the
one derived from recent supernovae observations. However the sign of it is
negative -- opposite to what is suggested by these observations. This
discrepancy may be a hint of the existence of an extra very light scalar,
perhaps a Cosmon-like dilaton, which should essentially decouple from the SM
Lagrangian, but that it nevertheless could mediate new macroscopic forces in
the submillimeter range.

solutions are classified in terms of supertranslations, dilations, Lorentz
transformations, R-symmetry transformations and special superconformal
transformations. Superconformal group is then identified with a supermatrix
group, OSp(N|2,R), as expected from the analysis on simple Lie superalgebras.
In general, due to the invariance under supertranslations and special
superconformal transformations, superconformally invariant n-point functions
reduce to one unspecified (n-2)-point function which must transform
homogeneously under the remaining rigid transformations, i.e. dilations,
Lorentz transformations and R-symmetry transformations. After constructing
building blocks for superconformal correlators, we are able to identify all the
superconformal invariants and obtain the general form of n-point functions.
Superconformally covariant differential operators are also discussed.

and metric of any (even degenerate) signature is presented. The method
encapsulates trigonometry for all these spaces into a single basic
trigonometric group equation. This brings to its logical end the idea of an
absolute trigonometry, and provides equations which hold true for the nine
two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature and any signature. This family of
spaces includes both relativistic and non-relativistic homogeneous spacetimes;
therefore a complete discussion of trigonometry in the six de Sitter,
minkowskian, Newton--Hooke and galilean spacetimes follow as particular
instances of the general approach. Any equation previously known for the three
classical riemannian spaces also has a version for the remaining six
spacetimes; in most cases these equations are new. Distinctive traits of the
method are universality and self-duality: every equation is meaningful for the
nine spaces at once, and displays explicitly invariance under a duality
transformation relating the nine spaces. The derivation of the single basic
trigonometric equation at group level, its translation to a set of equations
(cosine, sine and dual cosine laws) and the natural apparition of angular and
lateral excesses, area and coarea are explicitly discussed in detail. The
exposition also aims to introduce the main ideas of this direct group
theoretical way to trigonometry, and may well provide a path to systematically
study trigonometry for any homogeneous symmetric space.

of these atomic Q-parameters is compared with that parameter for the cavity
field.

quantum key distribution (QKD) enables an eavesdropper to perform unambiguous
state discrimination. We explore quantitatively the limits for secure QKD
imposed by this fact taking into account that the receiver can monitor to some
extend the photon number statistics of the signals even with todays standard
detection schemes. We compare our attack to the beamsplitting attack and show
that security against beamsplitting attack does not necessarily imply security
against the attack considered here.

phase. This indeterminacy does not matter if it is global, but what if the
components of the state have unknown relative phases? Can useful computations
be performed in spite of this local indeterminacy? We consider this question in
relation to the problem of the rotation of a qubit and examine its broader
implications for quantum computing.

<U(t)>=exp(At+B+C(t)). The constants A and B and the decreasing function C(t)
are computed in perturbation theory. The ABC-formula is valid for a general
class of Hamiltonians used in statistical physics and quantum field theory. The
formula includes the higher order corrections to the well known
Weisskopf-Wigner approximation and to the stochastic (van Hove) limit which are
widely used in considerations of problems of radiation, decay, quantum
decoherence, derivation of master and kinetic equations etc. The function C(t)
admits an interpretation as an analogue of the autocorrelation function
describing quantum chaos for the quantum baker's map.
