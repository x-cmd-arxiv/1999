5 times higher than the average early-type lensing galaxy. This large
mass-to-light is almost certainly the result of the additional mass

carried out at 1.4 and 8.5 GHz with the VLA centered on the Hubble Deep Field.
Further MERLIN observations of the HDF region at 1.4 GHz provided an angular
resolution of 0.2"" and when combined with the VLA data produced an image with
an unprecedented rms noise of 4 $\mu$Jy. All radio sources detected in the VLA
complete sample are resolved with a median angular size of 1-2"". The
differential count of the radio sources is marginally sub-Euclidean ($\gamma$ =
-2.4 $\pm$ 0.1) and fluctuation analysis suggests nearly 60 sources per
arcmin$^2$ are present at the 1 $\mu$Jy level. A correlation analysis indicates
spatial clustering among the 371 radio sources on angular scales of 1- 40

  Optical identifications are made primarily with bright (I = 22) disk systems
composed of irregulars, peculiars, interacting/merging galaxies, and a few
isolated field spirals. Available redshifts span the range 0.2 - 3. These clues
coupled with the steep spectral index of the 1.4 GHz selected sample are
indicative of diffuse synchrotron radiation in distant galactic disks. Thus the
evolution in the microjansky radio population is driven principally by
star-formation.
  I have isolated a number of optically faint radio sources (about 25% of the

constitute a new class of radio sources which are candidate high-z dusty

some of the scaling properties of dynamically relaxed systems of cosmic

provides an explanation of the observed puzzle that the total masses of

applicable to scales on which the clusters are quasi-virialized. In the

  A new scenario is presented for the production of Na23 in asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars. The scenario takes advantage of the periodic third
dredge-up episodes characterizing those stars, which mix primary C12 from their
intershell layers to their surface. Two successive interpulse/pulse/dredge-up
sequences are then required to produce Na23. During the first sequence carbon
and oxygen are converted into N14 by the hydrogen burning shell, and
subsequently transformed into Ne22 by the helium burning shell. During the
second sequence, Ne22 is converted into Na23 by the hydrogen burning shell,
which is brought to the surface by the subsequent dredge-up episode. The Na23
produced by this scenario is thus primary.
  The efficiency of this scenario is analyzed through standard evolutionary AGB
model predictions combined with synthetic calculations for the surface chemical
evolution. It is shown that primary Na23 can efficiently be produced as soon as
the surface C+N+O abundance enhancement reaches a certain level depending on
the stellar metallicity. The required surface C+N+O abundance enhancement
amounts to about 0.4 dex in solar metallicity stars, and to about 0.8 dex at a
metallicity five times less than solar.

the classical evolution operator $\hat{U} $. The resolvent poles are located
inside the unit circle. For hyperbolic systems this is a rigorous result, but
little is known about mixed systems such as the kicked rotor. In this work, the
leading relaxation rates of the kicked rotor are calculated in presence of

is taken and the relaxation rates are found to be finite, corresponding to
poles lying inside the unit circle. It is found that the slow relaxation rates,
in essence, correspond to diffusion modes in the momentum direction. Faster
relaxation modes intermix the motion in the momentum and the angle space. The
slowest relaxation rate of distributions in the angle space is calculated
analytically by studying the dynamics of inhomogeneities projected down to this

density is found $\Omega = 1$ and in anycase with lower limit $\Omega \geq

level, this model is by its construction close to the standard cosmological

(investigation of ``a.s. Gibbsianness''). In particular we gave natural
``negative'' examples where this set is even of measure one (including the
random field Ising model). Further we discuss conditions giving the convergence
of vacuum potentials and conditions for the decay of the joint potential in
terms of the decay of the disorder average over certain quenched correlations.
We apply them to various examples. From this one typically expects the
existence of a potential that decays superpolynomially outside a set of measure
zero. Our proof uses a martingale argument that allows to cut (an infinite
volume analogue of) the quenched free energy into local pieces, along with
generalizations of Kozlov's constructions.

nonrelativistic chiral constituent quark model where the Hamiltonian contains a
linear confinement and a pseudoscalar meson (Goldstone boson) exchange
interaction between the quarks. This interaction has a long range Yukawa-type
part, depending on the mass of the exchanged meson and a short range part,
mainly responsible for the good description of the baryon spectra. We calculate
the NN potential in the adiabatic approximation as a function of Z, the
separation distance between the centres of the two three-quark clusters. The
orbital part of the six-quark states is constructed either from the usual
cluster model states or from molecular orbital single particle states. The
latter are more realistic, having proper axially and reflectionally symmetries.
In both cases the potential presents an important hard core at short distances,
explained through the dominance of the [51]{FS} configuration. However in the
molecular orbital basis the core is less repulsive, as a consequence of the
fact that this basis gives a better upper bound for the energy of the six-quark
system. We calculate the potential for the 3S1 and 3S0 channels with two
different parametrizations. We find a small (few MeV) attractive pocket for one
of these parametrizations. A middle range attraction is simulated by the
addition of a sigma-meson exchange interaction between quarks, of a form
similar to that of the pseudoscalar meson exchange. The present study is an
intermediate, useful step towards dynamical calculations based on the
resonating group method.
