nucleosynthesis sites in our Galaxy. The combined activity of stellar winds and
core-collapse supernovae ejects significant amounts of freshly synthesised
nuclei into the interstellar medium. Radioactive isotopes, such as 26Al or
60Fe, that have been co-produced in such events may eventually be observed by
gamma-ray instruments through their characteristic decay-line signatures. In
order to study such signatures and to derive constraints on the involved
nucleosynthesis processes, we developed a multi-wavelength evolutionary
synthesis model for massive star associations. We apply this model to
associations and clusters in the well-studied Cygnus region for which we
re-determined the stellar census based on photometric and spectroscopic data.
In particular we study the relation between 1.809 MeV gamma-ray line emission
and ionising flux, since the latter has turned out to provide an excellent
tracer of the global galactic 1.809 MeV emission. We compare our model to
COMPTEL 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line observations from which we derive limits on the
relative contributions from massive stars and core-collapse supernovae to the
actual 26Al content in this region. Based on our model we make predictions
about the expected 26Al and 60Fe line signatures in the Cygnus region. These
predictions make the Cygnus region a prime target for the future INTEGRAL
mission.

currently forming stars. These galaxies have absolute magnitudes in the range
M_B=-17.9 to -19.9 (H_o=50 km/s/Mpc). Their HI masses range between a few times
10^8 and a few times 10^9 M_sun and the corresponding values for M_HI/L_B are
between 0.07 and 0.42, so these systems are HI rich for their morphological
type. In all four galaxies, the HI is strongly centrally concentrated with high
central HI surface densities, in contrast to what is typically observed in more
luminous early-type galaxies. In two galaxies (NGC 802 and ESO 118-G34), the
kinematics of the HI suggests that the gas is in a strongly warped disk, which
we take as evidence for recent accretion of HI. In the other two galaxies (NGC
2328 and ESO 027-G21) the HI must have been part of the systems for a
considerable time. The HI properties of low-luminosity early-type galaxies
appear to be systematically different from those of many more luminous
early-type galaxies, and we suggest that these differences are due to a
different evolution of the two classes. The star formation history of these
galaxies remains unclear. Their UBV colours and Halpha emission-line strengths
are consistent with having formed stars at a slowly-declining rate for most of
the past 10^10 years. However, the current data do not rule out a small burst
of recent star formation overlaid on an older stellar population.

spectrum between 2 and 220 GHz, with a spectral index flatter than 0.15
(3sigma). There is no evidence for either a low- or high-frequency cut-off, but
in the mid-infrared (~30 microns) thermal emission from the OB-type companion
star becomes dominant. The integrated luminosity of this flat-spectrum emission
in quiescence is > 2 x 10^{31} erg/s (2 x 10^{24} W). Assuming the emission
originates in a jet for which non-radiative (e.g. adiabatic expansion) losses
dominate, this is a very conservative lower limit on the power required to
maintain the jet. A comparison with Cyg X-3 and GRS 1915+105, the other X-ray
binaries for which a flat spectrum at shorter than cm wavelengths has been
observed, shows that the jet in Cyg X-1 is significantly less luminous and less
variable, and is probably our best example to date of a continuous, steady,
outflow from an X-ray binary. The emissive mechanism reponsible for such a flat
spectral component remains uncertain. Specifically, we note that the radio-mm
spectra observed from these X-ray binaries are much flatter than those of the
`flat-spectrum' AGN, and that existing models of synchrotron emission from
partially self-absorbed radio cores, which predict a high-frequency cut-off in

proportional to the rate of dissipation. The fast quantum system is assumed to
be chaotic in the classical limit for each configuration of the slow system. An
analytic formula is obtained for the finite time integral of the correlation
function, in the framework of random matrix theory (RMT), for a specific
dependence on the adiabatically varying parameter. Extension to a wider class
of RMT models is discussed. For the Gaussian unitary and symplectic ensembles
for long times the time integral of the correlation function vanishes or falls
off as a Gaussian with a characteristic time that is proportional to the
Heisenberg time, depending on the details of the model. The fall off is
inversely proportional to time for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble. The
correlation function is found to be dominated by the nearest neighbor level
spacings. It was calculated for a variety of nearest neighbor level spacing

developed into a very active and fascinating subfield of mesoscopic physics. We
present a review of this development focusing on shot noise in small electric
conductors. Shot noise is a consequence of the quantization of charge. It can
be used to obtain information on a system which is not available through
conductance measurements. In particular, shot noise experiments can determine
the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and
reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of
mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of
electron-electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a
discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the
classical Langevin and Boltzmann-Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of
results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided. We conclude the
review by pointing out a number of unsolved problems and an outlook on the
likely future development of the field.

chiral, double Haldane, N\'{e}el, and double N\'{e}el (uudd) phases. The gapped
and gapless chiral phases are characterized by the spontaneous breaking of
parity, in which the long-range order parameter is a chirality, \kappa_l =
S_l^xS_{l+1}^y-S_l^yS_{l+1}^x, whereas the spin correlation decays either
exponentially or algebraically. These chiral ordered phases appear in a broad

discussed. (i) Employing the Bauer-Stech-Wirbel (BSW) model for form factors as
a benchmark, the $B\to\pi^+\pi^-$ data indicate that the form factor
$F_0^{B\pi}(0)$ is smaller than that predicted by the BSW model, whereas the
data of $B\to\omega\pi, K^*\eta$ imply that the form factors $A_0^{B\omega}(0),
A_0^{BK^*}(0)$ are greater than the BSW model's values. (ii) The tree-dominated
modes $B\to\pi^+\pi^-, \rho^0\pi^\pm, \omega\pi^\pm$ imply that the effective
number of colors N_c(LL) for (V-A)(V-A) operators is preferred to be smaller,
while the current limit on $B\to\phi K$ shows that N_c(LR)>3. The data of $B\to
K\eta'$ and $K^*\eta$ clearly indicate that $N_c(LR)\gg N_c(LL)$. (iii) In
order to understand the observed suppression of $\pi^+\pi^-$ and
non-suppression of $K\pi$ modes, both being governed by the form factor
$F_0^{B\pi}$, the unitarity angle $\gamma$ is preferred to be greater than
$90^\circ$. By contrast, the new measurement of $B^\pm\to\rho^0\pi^\pm$ no
longer strongly favors $\cos\gamma<0$. (iv) The observed pattern $K^-\pi^+\sim
\ov K^0\pi^-\sim {2\over 3}K^-\pi^0$ is consistent with the theoretical
expectation: The constructive interference between electroweak and QCD penguin
diagrams in the $K^-\pi^0$ mode explains why ${\cal B}(B^-\to K^-\pi^0)>{1\over
2}{\cal B}(\ov B^0\to K^-\pi^+)$. (v) The observation $\nc(LL)<3<\nc(LR)$ and
our preference for $\nc(LL)\sim 2$ and $\nc(LR)\sim 6$ are justified by a
recent perturbative QCD calculation of hadronic rare B decays in the heavy
quark limit.

reduced to the 2Dth power of an effective one-matrix eigenvalue-model which
makes the associated phase structure accessible. In particular a simple

as a partial wave series. For small $Z$ the series can be summed up
approximately to give a closed form. The result, though being aproximate,
exhibites some nonperturbative feature and cannot be obtained from perturbative
quantum electrodynamics at the tree level.
