describe the continuation of interstellar cooling flows deep into the cores of
elliptical galaxies. Interstellar gas within about r = 50 parsecs from the
massive black hole is heated to T > 1 keV and should be visible unless thermal
heating is diluted by non-thermal pressure. Since our flows are subsonic near
the massive black holes, distributed cooling continues within 300 pc from the
center. Dark, low mass stars formed in this region may be responsible for some
of the mass attributed to central black holes.

baseline neutrino oscillation experiments. In particular, we compare the
results obtained with simplifying approximations for the density profile in the
Earth versus results obtained with actual density profiles. We study the
dependence of the oscillation signals on both $E/\Delta m^2_{atm.}$ and on the
angles in the leptonic mixing matrix. The results show quantitatively how
matter effects can cause significant changes in the oscillation signals,
relative to vacuum oscillations and can be useful in amplifying these signals
and helping one to obtain measurements of mixing parameters and the magnitude
and sign of $\Delta m^2$.

a number of important exactly solvable models of strongly correlated electrons,

structural results on, and bounds on the size of, extremal configurations

the applicability of the method was extended to cover a wider range of problems
in coding and information theory. In this paper we present a general framework
for the method which includes previous results as particular cases. We explain
how this generalization leads to new asymptotic bounds on the performance of
codes in binary-input memoryless channels and the Gaussian channel, which
improve the results of Shannon et al. of 1959-67, and to a number of other
results in combinatorial coding theory.
