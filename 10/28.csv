important problem that we are confronted with. Some theorists suggest that
beaming effect usually leads to a sharp break in the afterglow light curve
during the ultra-relativistic phase, with the breaking point determined by
$\gamma = 1 / \theta_0$, where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor of the blastwave
and $\theta_0$ is the initial half opening angle of the ejecta, but numerical
studies tend to reject the suggestion. We note that previous studies are
uniformly based on dynamics that is not proper for non-relativistic blastwaves.
Here we investigate the problem in more detail, paying special attention to the
transition from the ultra-relativistic phase to the non-relativistic phase. Due
to some crucial refinements in the dynamics, we can follow the overall
evolution of a realistic jet till its velocity is as small as $\beta c \sim
10^{-3} c$. We find no obvious break in the optical light curve during the
relativistic phase itself. However, an obvious break does appear at the
transition from the relativistic phase to the Newtonian phase if the physical
parameters involved are properly assumed. Generally speaking, the Newtonian
phase is characterized by a sharp decay of optical afterglows, with the power
law timing index $\alpha \sim 1.8$ - 2.1. This is due to the quick lateral
expansion at this stage. The quick decay of optical afterglows from GRB 970228,
980326, and 980519, and the breaks in the optical light curves of GRB 990123
and 990510 may indicate the presence of highly collimated $\gamma$-ray burst

of this dataset used the Jeans equation to model the projected velocity
dispersion profile. However, the results of such an analysis always yield a
strong degeneracy between the mass density profile and the velocity dispersion
anisotropy profile. Here we analyze the full (R,v) dataset of galaxy positions
and velocities in an attempt to break this degeneracy. We build an `ensemble
cluster' from the individual clusters under the assumption that they form a
homologous sequence. To interpret the data we study a one-parameter family of
spherical models with different constant velocity dispersion anisotropy. The
best-fit model is sought using a variety of statistics, including the overall
likelihood of the dataset. Although the results of our analysis depend slightly
on which statistic is used to judge the models, all statistics agree that the
best-fit model is close to isotropic. This result derives primarily from the
fact that the observed grand-total velocity histogram is close to Gaussian,
which is not expected to be the case for a strongly anisotropic model. The
best-fitting models have a mass-to-number-density ratio that is approximately
independent of radius over the range constrained by the data. They also have a
mass-density profile that is consistent with the dark matter halo profile
advocated by Navarro, Frenk & White, in terms of both the profile shape and the
characteristic scale length. This adds important new weight to the evidence
that clusters do indeed follow this proposed universal mass density profile.

by which they are formed. We are aided, however, by the fact that many H- and
He-deficient pre-white dwarfs (PWDs) are multiperiodic g-mode pulsators.
Pulsations in PWDs provide a unique opportunity to probe their interiors, which
are otherwise inaccesible to direct observation. Until now, however, the nature
of the pulsation mechanism, the precise boundaries of the instability strip,
and the mass distribution of the PWDs were complete mysteries. These problems
must be addressed before we can apply knowledge of pulsating PWDs to improve
understanding of white dwarf formation. This paper lays the groundwork for
future theoretical investigations of these stars. In recent years, Whole Earth
Telescope observations led to determination of mass and luminosity for the
majority of the (non-central star) PWD pulsators. With these observations, we
identify the common properties and trends PWDs exhibit as a class. We find that
pulsators of low mass have higher luminosity, suggesting the range of
instability is highly mass-dependent. The observed trend of decreasing periods
with decreasing luminosity matches a decrease in the maximum (standing-wave)
g-mode period across the instability strip. We show that the red edge can be
caused by the lengthening of the driving timescale beyond the maximum
sustainable period. This result is general for ionization-based driving
mechanisms, and it explains the mass-dependence of the red edge. The observed
form of the mass-dependence provides a vital starting point for future
theoretical investigations of the driving mechanism. We also show that the blue
edge probably remains undetected because of selection effects arising from
rapid evolution.

understanding of radio emission from distant (0.1<z<3) starburst galaxies. We
have recently isolated a number of high redshift, dusty starburst galaxies that
remain invisible in ground based images to I_{AB}=25 and I_{AB}=28.5 in the
Hubble Deep Field. These galaxies appear as faint radio sources, often
accompanied by very red counterparts (I-K > 4-6) and submillimeter sources with
S > 2 mJy at 850 microns as measured with SCUBA on the JCMT. The far-infrared
luminosities of these galaxies exceeds even the most intense starbursts found
in the local universe (e.g., Arp 220), suggesting they are in the process of
converting the bulk of their gass mass into stars.
  These galaxies, completely absent in optical surveys, constitute 50% - 90% of
the star-formation density in the distant Universe. Given the poor sub-mm
resolution (15\arcs) of the SCUBA/JCMT images, we use the 0.2\arcs radio
imaging as a surrogate in order to understand the nature of the dominant
emission mechanism driving the FIR luminosity (AGN vs. star-formation).
Upcoming developments in radio instrumentation (the Expanded VLA Array and
Square Kilometer Array) will soon increase sensitivity and resolution orders of
magnitude, providing a natural complement to parallel developments in sub-mm
facilities (e.g., ALMA). With dual radio continuum and sub-mm surveys of the

externally calibrated galaxy magnitudes that follow a linear relation, while
the APM instrumental magnitudes of galaxies, only internally calibrated by the
use of stellar profiles, require second-order corrections. The completeness of
both catalogs in a general field falls rapidly fainter than b_J = 20.0, being
slightly better for APM. The 90% completeness level of the SSC is reached

Galaxies misclassified as stars in the SSC receive an incorrect magnitude
because the stellar ones take saturation into account besides using a different
calibration curve. In both cases, the misclassified galaxies show a large
diversity of colors that range from typical colors of early-types to those of
blue star-forming galaxies. A possible explanation for this effect is that it
results from the combination of low sampling resolutions with properties of the

an analysis of four monitoring observations of Cyg X-1, separated by 2 weeks
from each other, we find that a shortening of the time lags is associated with
a hardening of the X-ray spectrum, as well as with a longer characteristic
``shot time scale''. We briefly discuss possible physical/geometrical reasons
for this variability of the hard state properties.

efficient route to increase the ring overlap required for this mean-field

much larger than the excluded volume screening length $\xi$. At distances
larger than \dtop the conformational properties of the rings are governed by
the topological interactions, at smaller distances rings and their linear chain

the proper normal/vacuum boundary conditions both at the internal and at the

above which Tc(H) becomes quasi-linear, with the period identical to the Tc(H)

transition is similar to the 2D-3D transition for thin films in a parallel

thickness exceeds the temperature dependent coherence length by a factor 1.8.
For the presently studied loops, the crossover point is controlled by a similar

two dimensions, weakly disordered systems of this kind may possess a metallic
phase beyond the insulating phases expected for strong disorder. We show that
the 2d metal phase emanates from the free Majorana fermion point, in the
direction of the RG trajectory of a perturbed WZW model. To establish this
result, we develop a supersymmetric extension of the method of nonabelian
bosonization. On the metallic side of the metal-insulator transition, the
density of states becomes nonvanishing at zero energy, by a mechanism akin to
dynamical mass generation. This feature is explored in a model of N species of
disordered Dirac fermions, via the mapping on a nonlinear sigma model, which
encapsulates a Z_2 spin degree of freedom. We compute the density of states in
a finite system, and obtain agreement with the random-matrix prediction for
class D, in the ergodic limit. Vortex disorder, which is a relevant
perturbation at the free-fermion point, changes the density of states at low
energy and suppresses the local Z_2 degree of freedom, thereby leading to a
different symmetry class, BD.

generalized to incorporate a broad class of physically interesting situations.
The key idea is to replace the notion of stationary event horizons by that of
`isolated horizons.' Unlike event horizons, isolated horizons can be located in
a space-time quasi-locally. Furthermore, they need not be Killing horizons. In
particular, a space-time representing a black hole which is itself in
equilibrium, but whose exterior contains radiation, admits an isolated horizon.
In spite of this generality, the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics
extend to isolated horizons. Furthermore, by carrying out a systematic,
non-perturbative quantization, one can explore the quantum geometry of isolated
horizons and account for their entropy from statistical mechanical
considerations. After a general introduction to black hole thermodynamics as a

studied. In particular, the observation of the screening (called string
breaking) of the static quarks by the dynamical light quarks leading to the
formation of two static-light mesons was not observed before my work in
non-Abelian gauge theories. The tool that I employ is lattice gauge simulation.
The observable from which the spectrum of the Hamiltonian in presence of two
static quarks can be extracted, is a matrix correlation whose elements are
constructed not only from string-type states represented by Wilson loops (like
in pure gauge theories). Additional matrix elements representing transitions
from string-type to meson-type states and the propagation of meson-type states
are taken into account. From this basis of states it is possible to extract the
ground state and first excited state static potentials employing a variational
method. The crossing of these two energy levels in the string breaking region
is clearly visible and the inadequacy of the Wilson loops alone can be
demonstrated. I also address the question of the lattice artifacts. For this
purpose lines of constant physics in the confinement ``phase'' of the model
have to be constructed. This problem has only partially been solved.
Nevertheless it is possible to show that the static potentials have remarkable
scaling properties under a variation of the lattice spacing by a factor two and
are almost independent of the quartic Higgs coupling.

nonabelian discrete subgroups of SO(3) and SU(2), the so called dihedral groups
D_n and dicyclic groups Q_2n, which both have only singlet and doublet

reproduces the masses and mixings of all quarks and leptons, including
neutrinos. It has a large mixing angle in the mu - tau neutrino sector, in
accordance with the recent SuperKamiokande results, while keeping a small quark
mixing in the bottom - charm sector. The reason is similar to the one found in
the literature based on the SU(5) group: the large_left_ handed mixing angle in
the lepton sector corresponds to the large unphysical_right_ handed in the down
quark sector. The large mixing is also responsible for the different
hierarchies of the two heaviest families in the up and down sector, and can be
summarized as the order of magnitude relation: m_s/m_b \sim tan(theta_\mu\tau)

  2 June",,,,"hep-th",,"  An open bosonic string is considered with the aim to construct a general
gauge invariant, being a polynomial of Fubini-Veneziano (FV) fields. The FV
fields are transformed as 1-forms on $S^1$, that allows to formulate the
problem in geometric terms. We introduce a most general anzats for these
invariants and explicitly resolve the invariance conditions in the framework of
the anzats. The invariants are interpreted as integrals of n-form over a gauge
invariant domains in an n-dimensional torus, where the invariance of these
domains is considered with respect to the action of the diagonal of the group
$\times (Diff~S^1)^n$. We also discuss a possibility to get a complete set of
gauge invariants which allow an actual dependence on the string zero modes. We
find that the complete set can't be restricted by polynomial invariants only.
The classical polynomial invariants, being directly defined in the string Fock
space, turn out to break the structure of the respective BRST cohomology even
in the critical dimension. We discuss a possibility to restore the BRST
invariance of the corresponding operator algebra by a non-trivial quantum
deformation of the original invariants.
