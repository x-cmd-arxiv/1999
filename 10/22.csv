X-ray sources in the low-hard state: Cygnus X-1, GX 339-4, GRS 1758-258 and 1E

shape at higher energies. The other three sources have energy independent PDS
shapes. The energy dependence of the overall variability (the integrated rms
amplitude) varies from source to source and from observation to observation.
1E~1740.7-2942, for example, has a variability generally increasing with energy
while GX 339-4 has a decreasing variability. A general trend is found in the
four sources that the integrated rms amplitude anti-correlates with the X-ray
flux. We compare these distinct energy dependent behaviors with several
emission models. None of the models can fully explain all the features that we
have found.

a variety of linear secondary effects to produce a bispectrum. For the

non-coherent periodic hump of variable amplitude. A seasonal time series
analysis yields a photometric period of 0.0756(12) d. In addition, low
amplitude fluctuations of the mean magnitude in time scale of months are
observed. We find that the hump's amplitude is anti-correlated with the star's

""anti-hump"") when the system is very faint. Secondary humps and ""anti-humps""

NGC 6445 obtained with ISO. These data show that the thermal emission from the
grains is very cool and has a low flux compared to H beta. A model of the
ionized region is constructed, using the photo-ionization code CLOUDY 90.05.
Based on this model, we show from depletions in the gas phase elements that
little grain destruction can have occurred in the ionized region of NGC 6445.
We also argue that dust-gas separation in the nebula is not plausible. The most
likely conclusion is that grains are residing inside the ionized region of NGC
6445 and that the low temperature and flux of the grain emission are caused by
the low luminosity of the central star and the low optical depth of the grains.
This implies that the bulk of the silicon-bearing grains in this nebula were
able to survive exposure to hard UV photons for at least several thousands of
years, contradicting previously published results. A comparison between optical
and infrared diagnostic line ratios gives a marginal indication for the
presence of a t^2-effect in the nebula. However, the evidence is not convincing
and other explanations for the discrepancy are also plausible. The off-source
spectrum taken with ISO-LWS clearly shows the presence of a warm cirrus
component with a temperature of 24 K as well as a very cold component with a
temperature of 7 K. Since our observation encompasses only a small region of
the sky, it is not clear how extended the 7 K component is and whether it
contributed significantly to the FIRAS spectrum taken by COBE. Because our line
of sight is in the galactic plane, the very cold component could be a starless

higher than for radiation incident over all angles. This paper presents
calculations of both spin-0 (scalar) superradiance (integrating the radial
equation rather than using the WKB method) and and spin-1
(electromagnetic/magnetosonic) superradiance, in Van Putten's wedge geometry.
In contrast to the scalar case, spin-1 superradiance decreases in the wedge
geometry, decreasing the likelihood of its astrophysical importance.

protoplanetary disk to the presence of a planet of one Jupiter mass (1 M_J) and
greater that orbits a 1 solar mass star by using the ZEUS hydrodynamics code

in a circular orbit about the central star and is not allowed to migrate. A gap
is formed about the orbit of the planet, but there is a nonaxisymmetric flow
through the gap and onto the planet. The gap partitions the disk into an inner
(outer) disk that extends inside (outside) the planet's orbit. For a 1 M_J
planet and typical disk parameters, the accretion through the gap onto the
planet is highly efficient. For typical disk parameters, the mass doubling time
scale is less than 10^5 years, considerably shorter than the disk lifetime.
Following shocks near the L1 and L2 Lagrange points, disk material enters the
Roche lobe in the form of two gas streams. Shocks occur within the Roche lobe
as the gas streams collide, and shocks lead to rapid inflow towards the planet
within much of planet's Roche lobe. Shocks also propagate in the inner and
outer disks that orbit the star. For higher mass planets (of order 6 M_J), the
flow rate onto the planet is considerably reduced, which suggests an upper mass
limit to planets in the range of 10 M_J. This rate reduction is related to the
fact that the gap width increases relative to the Roche (Hill sphere) radius
with increasing planetary mass. The flow in the gap affects planetary
migration. For the 1 M_J planet case, mass can penetrate from the outer disk to
the inner disk, so that the inner disk is not depleted. The results suggest
that most of the mass in gas giant planets is acquired by flows through gaps.

  Astrophysical Journal Letters",,"10.1086/312393",,"astro-ph",,"  We present results from a BeppoSAX observation of the rich cluster Abell
3266. The broad band spectrum (2-50 keV) of the cluster, when fitted with an
optically thin thermal emission model, yields a temperature of 8.1 +/- 0.2 keV
and a metal abundance of 0.17 +/- 0.02 in solar units, and with no evidence of
a hard X-ray excess in the PDS spectrum. By performing a spatially resolved
spectral analysis we find that the projected temperature drops with increasing
radius, going from ~ 10 keV at the cluster core to ~ 5 keV at about 1.5 Mpc.
Our BeppoSAX temperature profile is in good agreement with the ASCA temperature
profile of Markevitch et al. (1998). From our two-dimensional temperature map
we find that the gradient is observed in all azimuthal directions. The
temperature gradient may have been caused by a recent merger event also
responsible for a velocity dispersion gradient measured in the optical band.
The projected metal abundance profile and two-dimensional map are both
consistent with being constant.

lensing statistics of the Jodrell Bank-VLA Astrometric Survey (JVAS), optical
gravitational lens surveys from the literature and CMB anisotropies. This is
the first time that quantitative joint constraints involving lensing statistics
and CMB anisotropies have been presented. Within the assumptions made, we
achieve very tight constraints on both lambda_0 and Omega_0. These assumptions
are cold dark matter models, no tensor components, no reionisation, CMB
temperature T_CMB=2.728, number of neutrinos n_nu=3, helium abundance
Y_He=0.246, spectral index n_s=1.0, Hubble constant H_0=68km/s/Mpc, baryonic
density Omega_b=0.05. All models were normalised to the COBE data and no closed
models (k=+1) were computed. Using the CMB data alone, the best-fit model has
lambda_0=0.60 and Omega_0=0.34 and at 99% confidence the lower limit on
lambda_0+Omega_0 is 0.8. Including constraints from gravitational lensing
statistics doesn't change this significantly, although it does change the
allowed region of parameter space. A universe with lambda_0=0 is ruled out for
any value of Omega_0 at better than 99% confidence using the CMB alone.
Combined with constraints from lensing statistics, lambda_0=0 is also ruled out
at better than 99% confidence.
  As the region of parameter space allowed by the CMB is, within our
assumptions, much smaller than that allowed by lensing statistics, the main
result of combining the two is to change the range of parameter space allowed
by the CMB along its axis of degeneracy.

perturbation of the vorticity field. Vortices have a typical decay time of the
order of 50 orbital periods (for a viscosity parameter alpha=0.0001 and a disk
aspect ratio of H/r = 0.15). If vorticity is continuously generated at a
constant rate in the flow (e.g. by convection), then a large vortex can form
and be sustained (due to the merger of vortices).
  We find that dust concentrates in the cores of vortices within a few orbital
periods, when the drag parameter is of the order of the orbital frequency.
Also, the radial drift of the dust induces a significant increase in the
surface density of dust particles in the inner region of the disk. Thus,
vortices may represent the preferred location for planetesimal formation in
protoplanetary disks.
  We show that it is very difficult for vortex mergers to sustain a relatively
coherent outward flux of angular momentum.

has been a challenging one for a long time. To date, all attempts using
equilibrium Monte Carlo methods have been unconclusive. In their comment to our
paper, Marinari, Parisi and Zuliani use out-of-equilibrium measurements to test
for an Almeida-Thouless line. In our view such a dynamic approach is not based
on very solid foundations in finite dimensional systems and so cannot be as
compelling as equilibrium approaches. Nevertheless, the results of those
authors suggests that there is a critical field near B=0.4 at zero temperature.
In view of this quite small value (compared to the mean field value), we have
reanalyzed our data. We find that if finite size scaling is to distinguish
between that small field and a zero field, we would need to go to lattice sizes
of about 20x20x20.

branch reveals a ferromagnetic and isotropic coupling, already found in
Ca-doped samples. Its q-dependent intensity, very anisotropic, closely reflects

  Chapter 3 about ""TCP Trunking"" will be published in IEEE ICNP'99 Proceedings.
  A condensed version of this thesis is currently submitted to a conference",,,,"cs.NI",,"  Many applications want to use TCP congestion control to regulate the
transmission rate of a data packet stream. A natural way to achieve this goal
is to transport the data packet stream on a TCP connection. However, because
TCP implements both congestion and error control, transporting a data packet
stream directly using a TCP connection forces the data packet stream to be
subject to TCP's other properties caused by TCP error control, which may be
inappropriate for these applications.
  The TCP decoupling approach proposed in this thesis is a novel way of
applying TCP congestion control to a data packet stream without actually
transporting the data packet stream on a TCP connection. Instead, a TCP
connection using the same network path as the data packet stream is set up
separately and the transmission rate of the data packet stream is then
associated with that of the TCP packets. Since the transmission rate of these
TCP packets is under TCP congestion control, so is that of the data packet
stream. Furthermore, since the data packet stream is not transported on a TCP
connection, the regulated data packet stream is not subject to TCP error
control.
  Because of this flexibility, the TCP decoupling approach opens up many new
opportunities, solves old problems, and improves the performance of some
existing applications. All of these advantages will be demonstrated in the
thesis.
  This thesis presents the design, implementation, and analysis of the TCP

important problem of distributed database systems. Actually, transactions
establish dependence relations on data checkpoints taken by data object
managers. So, given an arbitrary set of data checkpoints (including at least a
single data checkpoint from a data manager, and at most a data checkpoint from
each data manager), an important question is the following one: ``Can these
data checkpoints be members of a same consistent global checkpoint?''. This
paper answers this question by providing a necessary and sufficient condition
suited for database systems. Moreover, to show the usefulness of this
condition, two {\em non-intrusive} data checkpointing protocols are derived
from this condition. It is also interesting to note that this paper, by
exhibiting ``correspondences'', establishes a bridge between the data
object/transaction model and the process/message-passing model.

the conventional Einstein equations in the low energy limit. {}From our general
argument we conclude that the first Randall & Sundrum-type theory (RS1)
[hep-ph/9905221] predicts that the brane with the negative tension is an
anti-gravity world and hence should be excluded from the physical point of
view. Their second-type theory (RS2) [hep-th/9906064] where the brane has the
positive tension provides the correct signature of gravity. In this latter
case, if the bulk spacetime is exactly anti-de Sitter, generically the matter
on the brane is required to be spatially homogeneous because of the Bianchi
identities. By allowing deviations from anti-de Sitter in the bulk, the
situation will be relaxed and the Bianchi identities give just the relation
between the Weyl tensor and the energy momentum tensor. In the present brane
world scenario, the effective Einstein equations cease to be valid during an
era when the cosmological constant on the brane is not well-defined, such as in
the case of the matter dominated by the potential energy of the scalar field.

to select the physical sector. Finally the quantization reproduces the Dirac
equation in the given background and, thus, justifies the interpretation of the

Newton polygon. We consider general boundary operators $B_1(x,D),...,B_m(x,D)$
and define N-ellipticity for the boundary value problem $(A,B_1,...,B_m)$
analogously to the Shapiro-Lopatinskii condition. It is shown that the boundary
value problem is N-elliptic if and only if an a priori estimate holds, where
the norms in the estimate are again defined in terms of the Newton polygon.

presented. In particular, it is shown that statistically motivated evaluation
of experimental data may lead to a significant improvement in phase fitting
upon the conventional Noh, Fouge'res and Mandel procedure. The analysis is
extended to the asymptotic limit of large intensities, where a strong evidence
in favor of multi--dimensional estimation procedures has been found.
