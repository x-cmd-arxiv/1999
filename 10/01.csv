thermonuclear flame propagating in C+O white dwarf matter. Based on a Monte
Carlo description of turbulence, it provides a method for investigating the
physics in the so-called distributed burning regime. Using this method we
perform numerical simulations of turbulent flames and show that in this
particular regime the flamelet model for the turbulent flame velocity loses its
validity. In fact, at high turbulent intensities burning in the distributed
regime can lead to a deceleration of the turbulent flame and thus induces a
competing process to turbulent effects that cause a higher flame speed. It is
also shown that in dense C+O matter turbulent heat transport is described
adequately by the Peclet number, Pe, rather than by the Reynolds number, which
means that flame propagation is decoupled from small-scale turbulence. Finally,
at the onset of our results we argue that the available turbulent energy in an
exploding C+O white dwarf is probably too low in order to make a deflagration
to detonation transition possible.

directly away from or toward the cluster centre, with more of the former than
the latter. If this morphology is attributed to ram pressure, then the WATs are
on primarily radial orbits, with more approaching the X-ray centroid than
receding. There is also some evidence that the in-coming WATs are on average
further from the X-ray centroid than the out-going ones. All of these
observations strongly support a scenario in which WATs are created in cluster

  slowly rotating stars : I Setting the stage","9 pages, 7 figures, to be published in A&A",,,,"astro-ph",,"  It has been known for a long time (Mestel 1953) that the meridional
circulation velocity in stars, in the presence of mu-gradients, is the sum of
two terms, one due to the classical thermal imbalance (omega-currents) and the
other one due to the induced horizontal mu-gradients (mu-induced currents, of
mu-currents in short). In the most general cases, mu-currents are opposite to
omega-currents. Simple expressions for these currents are derived under some
simplifying physical assumptions presented in the text, and their physical
interpretations are discussed. Computations of the omega and mu-currents in a
0.8 Mo halo stellar model including classical element settling show that the
mu-currents are larger (in absolute values) than the omega-currents in all the
star : some new physics has thus to be invoked in this case. We show here how
such processes could possibly lead to a quasi-equilibrium stage in which both
the circulation and the helium settling could be cancelled out. As lithium
diffuses in the same way as helium, we expect a very small lithium
concentration gradient below the convective zone in ""plateau stars"" (main
sequence PopII stars), much smaller than the one expected for pure element
settling. This could possibly account for the very small dispersion observed
for the lithium abundances at the surface of these stars. This should also have
important consequences in other contexts which will be discussed in forthcoming
papers. The present computations show that element settling in slowly rotating
stars leads to surface abundances which depend on the competition between
mu-currents and omega-currents, in a way which had not been taken into account
in previous computations. This may change our general understanding of the
diffusion processes of chemical species in rotating stars.

evolved. With the addition of the new library we are able to investigate the

dispersion profile; (2) we apply the virial mass estimator to the cluster. With

two different types of low-frequency QPOs, based on their coherence and
harmonic content. The first type is characterized by a 6 Hz QPO with a Q (the
QPO frequency divided by the QPO width) of <3 and with a harmonic at 12 Hz. The
second type of QPO is characterized by a 6 Hz QPO with a Q value of >6 and with
harmonics at 3, 12, 18, and possibly at 9 Hz. Not only the Q values and the
harmonic content of the two types are different, but also their phase lag
behavior. For the first type of QPO, the low energy photons (<5 keV) of both
the 6 Hz QPO and its harmonic at 12 Hz lag the hard energy photons (>5 keV) by
as much as 1.3 radian. The phase lags of the second type of QPO are more
complex. The soft photons (<5 keV) of the 3 and the 12 Hz QPOs lag the hard
photons (>5 keV) by as much as 1.0 radian. However, the soft photons of the 6
Hz QPO precede the hard ones by as much as 0.6 radian. This means that
different harmonics of this type of QPO have different signs for their phase
lags. This unusual behavior is hard to explain when the lags are due to
light-travel-time differences between the photons at different energies, e.g.,
in a Comptonizing region surrounding the area where the QPOs are formed.

independently. The mass maps are remarkably similar, which confirm that the PSF
correction worked well. The ISAAC and FORS data were combined to measure the
photometric redshifts and constrain the redshift distribution of the lensed
sources. The total mass inferred from weak shear is 2.3 10^{14} h^{-1} Mo on
large scales, in agreement with the X-ray mass. The measured mass profile is
well fit by both Navarro, Frenk and White and isothermal sphere with core
radius models although the NFW is slightly better. In the inner regions, the
lensing mass is about 2 times higher than the X-ray mass, which supports the
view that complex physical processes in the innermost parts of clusters are
responsible for the X-ray/lensing mass discrepancy. The central part of the
cluster is composed of two mass peaks whose the center of mass is 15 arcsecond
north of the cD galaxy. This provides an explanation for the 15 arcsecond
offset between the cD and the center of the X-ray map reported elsewhere. The
optical, X-ray and the mass distributions show that MS 1008-1224 is composed of
many subsystems which are probably undergoing a merger. MS 1008-1224 shows a

After a short description of the main numerical simulation techniques, three
sample applications illustrate how numerical simulations have provided deeper
insight in the galaxy formation process and how they have illuminated success
and failure of the hierarchical galaxy formation paradigm: N-body simulations
demonstrate that the density profiles of dark matter halos that form in
hierarchical clustering scenarios follow a characteristic law. A comparison
with the kinematics of disk galaxies however unravels that these density
profiles are too concentrated. Hydrodynamical simulation show that the highly
irregular velocity field of merging subclumps at redshift $z\approx 3$ can
easily account for the observed asymmetry in the absorption profiles of low
ionization species in damped \Lya absorption systems. The built-up of galaxies
due to mergers is however also cause for one of the major inconsistencies of
hierarchical structure formation models, the failure to reproduce the sizes of
the present day disk galaxies due to excessive transport of angular momentum
from the baryonic to the dark matter component. Hydrodynamical simulations that
include star formation show that scaling laws like the Tully-Fisher relation
can readily be reproduced in hierarchical scenarios, however the high
concentration of dark matter halos results in a zero-point of the simulated
Tully-Fisher relation that is incompatible wi th observations.

distribution of galaxies arises when some observational quantities, selected by
their relevance in average density profile determination, are calculated along
the past light cone. Implementing these conditions in the proposed set of
observational relations profoundly changes the behaviour of many observables in
the standard cosmological models. In particular, the average density becomes
observationally inhomogeneous, even in the spatially homogeneous spacetime of
standard cosmology, change which was already analysed by Ribeiro (1992b, 1993,
1994, 1995: astro-ph/9910145) for a non-perturbed model. Here we derive
observational relations in a perturbed Einstein-de Sitter cosmology by means of
the perturbation scheme proposed by Abdalla and Mohayaee (1999:
astro-ph/9810146), where the scale factor is expanded in power series to yield
perturbative terms. The differential equations derived in this perturbative
context, and other observables necessary in our analysis, are solved
numerically. The results show that our perturbed Einstein-de Sitter cosmology
can be approximately described by a decaying power-law like average density
profile, meaning that the dust distribution of this cosmology has a scaling
behaviour compatible with the power-law profile of the density-distance
correlation observed in the galaxy catalogues. These results show that, in the

  ""ISO Beyond Point Sources"" held at VILSPA 14-17 September 1999",,,,"astro-ph",,"  ISO observations at 200 micron have modified our view of the dust component
in spiral galaxies. For a sample of seven resolved spirals we have retrieved a
mean temperature of 20K, about 10K lower than previous estimates based on IRAS
data at shorter wavelengths. Because of the steep dependence of far-infrared
emission on the dust temperature, the dust masses inferred from ISO fluxes are
a factor of 10 higher than those derived from IRAS data only, leading to
gas-to-dust ratios close to the value observed in the Galaxy. The scale-length
of the 200 micron emission is larger than for the IRAS 100 micron emission,
with colder dust at larger distances from the galactic centre, as expected if
the interstellar radiation field is the main source of dust heating. The 200
micron scale-length is also larger than the optical, for all the galaxies in
the sample. This suggests that the dust distribution is more extended than that
of the stars.A model of the dust heating is needed to derive the parameters of
the dust distribution from the FIR emission. Therefore, we have adapted an
existing radiative transfer code to deal with dust emission. Simulated maps of
the temperature distribution within the dust disk and of the dust emission at
any wavelength can be produced. The stellar spectral energy distribution is
derived from observations in the ultraviolet, optical and near infrared. The
parameters of the dust distribution (scale-lengths and optical depth) are
chosen to reproduce the observed characteristics of the FIR emission, i.e. the
shape of the spectrum, the flux and the spatial distribution. We describe the
application of the model to one of the galaxies in the sample, NGC 6946.

The duration of the quiescence state is inversely related to the QPO-frequency.
We derive this relation. We also find the correlation between the observed low

non-detections. We have found evidence for a lower atomic gas content per unit
area in interacting galaxies compared to isolated ones. Except for a few
systems with high far-infrared luminosity and correspondingly high CO fluxes,
the interacting galaxies are not unusually CO-bright. The observed
HI-deficiency is therefore not due to a conversion from HI into H2. Atomic gas
from the outer part of the galaxies may have been swept by tidal interaction,
or the optical extent of the galaxies may have increased due to the tidal
interaction. The interacting galaxies seem to be more efficient at transforming
their molecular gas into stars, as indicated by their higher LFIR/M(H2) ratio.

and neutron stars. Difference between stellar outflows and outflows from these
systems is that the outflows in these systems have to form out of the inflowing
material only. The inflowing material can form a hot and dense cloud
surrounding the compact object, either because of a centrifugal barrier, or a
denser barrier due to pair plasma or pre-heating effects. This barrier behaves
like a stellar surface as far as the mass loss is concerned. We estimate the
outflow rate from the regions of shock compressed flow. The outflow rate is
directly related to the compression ratio of the gas at the shocks. These
estimated rates roughly match the rates in real observations as well as those
obtained from numerical experiments. In special geometries, where the solid
angle of the outflow is higher, the disk evacuation takes place creating
quiescence states. Outflows are shown to be important in deciding the spectral
states and Quasi Periodic Oscillations (QPO)s of observed X-rays.

directly the volume-averaged velocity field. The results of our simulations are
compared with the predictions of the third-order perturbation theory (3PT) for
the DVDR. We investigate both the mean `forward' relation (density in terms of
velocity divergence) and the mean `inverse' relation (velocity divergence in
terms of density), with emphasis on the latter. On scales larger than about 20
megaparsecs, our code recovers the predictions of 3PT remarkably well,
significantly better than recent N-body simulations. On scales of a few
megaparsecs, the DVDR predicted by 3PT differs slightly from the simulated one.
In particular, approximating the inverse DVDR by a third-order polynomial turns
out to be a poor fit. We propose a simple analytical description of the inverse
relation, which works well for mildly non-linear scales.

a BCS-like gap which closes at T_c. From the analysis of the data we conclude
that a significant intra-gap density of localized states exists in these

time-resolved optical experiments because of the different time- and

Localized charges are suggested to be the most likely origin of the intra-gap

Submitted to Transactions of Computational Logic",,,,"cs.LO cs.AI",,"  The semantic framework for the modal logic of knowledge due to Halpern and
Moses provides a way to ascribe knowledge to agents in distributed and
multi-agent systems. In this paper we study two special cases of this
framework: full systems and hypercubes. Both model static situations in which
no agent has any information about another agent's state. Full systems and
hypercubes are an appropriate model for the initial configurations of many
systems of interest. We establish a correspondence between full systems and
hypercube systems and certain classes of Kripke frames. We show that these
classes of systems correspond to the same logic. Moreover, this logic is also
the same as that generated by the larger class of weakly directed frames. We
provide a sound and complete axiomatization, S5WDn, of this logic. Finally, we
show that under certain natural assumptions, in a model where knowledge evolves
over time, S5WDn characterizes the properties of knowledge not just at the
initial configuration, but also at all later configurations. In particular,
this holds for homogeneous broadcast systems, which capture settings in which
agents are initially ignorant of each others local states, operate
synchronously, have perfect recall and can communicate only by broadcasting.

perspective of logic, or more specifically, descriptive complexity theory.
  We propose to consider parameterized model-checking problems for various
fragments of first-order logic as generic parameterized problems and show how
this approach can be useful in studying both fixed-parameter tractability and
intractability. For example, we establish the equivalence between the
model-checking for existential first-order logic, the homomorphism problem for
relational structures, and the substructure isomorphism problem. Our main
tractability result shows that model-checking for first-order formulas is
fixed-parameter tractable when restricted to a class of input structures with
an excluded minor. On the intractability side, for every t >= 0 we prove an
equivalence between model-checking for first-order formulas with t quantifier
alternations and the parameterized halting problem for alternating Turing
machines with t alternations. We discuss the close connection between this
alternation hierarchy and Downey and Fellows' W-hierarchy.
  On a more abstract level, we consider two forms of definability, called Fagin
definability and slicewise definability, that are appropriate for describing
parameterized problems. We give a characterization of the class FPT of all
fixed-parameter tractable problems in terms of slicewise definability in finite
variable least fixed-point logic, which is reminiscent of the Immerman-Vardi
Theorem characterizing the class PTIME in terms of definability in least

many more recursions than previously suspected from geometry (and indeed they
