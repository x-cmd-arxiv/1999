A present paper proceeds from the assumption of physical reality of space
contrary to the standard view of the space as a purely relational nonexistence

Mega- and micro-worlds. Thus cosmology and particle physics have the same
active agent - physical space.

evidence of energy diffusion. The finiteness of the conductivity is traced back
to the occurrence of phase-jumps. Our conclusions are confirmed by the analysis

wedge, in accord with Meyer's original mechanism for flexoelectricity. The less
prominent wedge produced a splay flexoelectric coefficient with the opposite
sign due to the attractive tail of the intermolecular potential and the
relative narrowness of the molecular head.

P(M/F,U(1)) metric and studied the case when the gauge potential Aa corresponds
to the magnetic field: Aa =(0, 0, A3, 0). We identified the base-space with the
space-time of two models of universe: the Robertson-Walker - like model and the
Schwarzschild - like model. With this ansatz, we followed an algorithm that
permits to express the magnetic field in terms of the gauge potential Aa and
the scalar field F. This algorithm seems to work very well if the scalar field
is time dependent. When we analyzed its dependence on other coordinates, new
terms it comes out on the 5D field equations. We obtained the translation
between the effective 4D electromagnetic potential and the 5D gauge and scalar
fields.

compact torus T^n such that the action is locally isomorphic to the standard
action of T^n on C^n and the orbit space is diffeomorphic, as manifold with
corners, to a simple polytope P^n. The name refers to the fact that topological
and combinatorial properties of quasitoric manifolds are similar to that of
non-singular algebraic toric varieties (or toric manifolds). Unlike toric
varieties, quasitoric manifolds may fail to be complex; however, they always
admit a stably (or weakly almost) complex structure, and their cobordism
classes generate the complex cobordism ring. As it have been recently shown by
Buchstaber and Ray, a stably complex structure on a quasitoric manifold is
defined in purely combinatorial terms, namely, by an orientation of the
polytope and a function from the set of codimension-one faces of the polytope
to primitive vectors of an integer lattice. We calculate the \chi_y-genus of a
quasitoric manifold with fixed stably complex structure in terms of the
corresponding combinatorial data. In particular, this gives explicit formulae
for the classical Todd genus and signature. We also relate our results with
well-known facts in the theory of toric varieties.
