equilibrium between the X-ray emitting plasma and cold reprocessor in active

determine the pressure at the transition zone, which is not arbitrary in the
static situation. The conditions for static solution are derived analytically
for different forms of plasma heating and for cooling provided by Compton
cooling, bremsstrahlung, and (optionally) advective cooling.
  We conclude that if Compton heating is the only heating mechanism, we always
achieve static equilibrium between the phases. For constant volume heating and
radiatively cooled plasma the static solution is never achieved and evaporation
or condensation takes place. However, static solutions with no
evaporation/condensation are found for radiative cooling supplemented with
lateral advection. Similar results are obtained for a two-temperature plasma.
In the case of a general prescription of mechanical heating ($Q^{+}=h_o P^m
T^{-s}$) of radiatively-cooled one-temperature plasma, we found that static
solution is only possible, when $0 < s < 3/2$.
  Such conditions apply to all models, like disc/corona solutions, ADAF flows
at their outer ADAF/disc boundary or cold clumps embedded in a hot medium.
These models have to be reconsidered and supplemented either with additional

behaviour of the outflows it is found that they attain a variety of shapes such
as conical, paraboloidal or cylindrical. However, non cylindrical asymptotics
can be achieved only when the magnetic pinching is negligible and the outflow
is overpressured on its symmetry axis. In cylindrical jet-type asymptotics, the
outflowing plasma reaches an equilibrium wherein it is confined by magnetic
forces or gas pressure gradients, while it is supported by centrifugal forces
or gas pressure gradients. In which of the two regimes (with thermal or
magnetic confinement) a jet can be found depends on the efficiency of the
central magnetic rotator. The radius and terminal speed of the jet are
analytically given in terms of the variation across the poloidal streamlines of
the total energy. Large radius of the jet and efficient acceleration are best
obtained when the external confinement is provided with comparable
contributions by magnetic pinching and thermal pressure. In most cases,
collimated streamlines undergo oscillations with various wavelengths, as also
found by other analytical models. Scenarios for the evolution of outflows into

Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). In the past VLBI data sets were usually
averaged so severely that the field-of-view was typically restricted to regions
extending a few hundred milliarcseconds from the phase centre of the field.
Recent advances in data analysis techniques, together with increasing data
storage capabilities, and enhanced computer processing power, now permit VLBI
images to be made whose angular size represents a significant fraction of an
individual antenna's primary beam. This technique has recently been
successfully applied to several large separation gravitational lens systems,
compact Supernova Remnants in the starburst galaxy M82, and two faint radio
sources located within the same VLA FIRST field. It seems likely that other
VLBI observing programmes might benefit from this wide-field approach to VLBI
data analysis. With the raw sensitivity of global VLBI set to improve by a
factor 4-5 over the coming few years, the number of sources that can be
detected in a given field will rise considerably. In addition, a continued
progression in VLBI's ability to image relatively faint and extended low
brightness temperature features (such as hot-spots in large-scale astrophysical
jets) is also to be expected. As VLBI sensitivity approaches the $\mu$Jy level,
a wide-field approach to data analysis becomes inevitable.

the steepening in the light curve of the R-band afterglow of the gamma-ray
burst (GRB) 990123 is caused by the adiabatic shock which has evolved from an
ultrarelativistic phase to a nonrelativistic phase in a dense medium. We find
that such a model is quite consistent with observations if the medium density
is about $3\times 10^6 {\rm cm}^{-3}$. Here we discuss this model in more
details. In particular, we investigate the effects of synchrotron self
absorption and energy injection. A shock in a dense medium becomes
nonrelativistic rapidly after a short relativistic phase. The afterglow from
the shock at the nonrelativistic stage decays more rapidly than at the
relativistic stage. Since some models for GRB energy sources predict that a
strongly magnetic millisecond pulsar may be born during the formation of GRB,
we discuss the effect of such a pulsar on the evolution of the nonrelativistic
shock through magnetic dipole radiation. We find that after the energy which
the shock obtains from the pulsar is much more than the initial energy of the
shock, the afterglow decay will flatten significantly. When the pulsar energy
input effect disappears, the decay will steepen again. These features are in
excellent agreement with the afterglows of GRB 980519, GRB 990510 and GRB
980326. Furthermore, our model fits very well all the observational data of GRB
980519 including the last two detections.

Bose gases is thwarted by the approach of the saddle-point to the ground-state
singularity of the grand canonical partition function. We develop and test a
variant of the saddle-point method which takes proper care of this
complication, and provides accurate, flexible, and computationally efficient
access to both canonical and microcanonical statistics. Remarkably, the error
committed when naively employing the conventional approximation in the
condensate regime turns out to be universal, that is, independent of the
system's single-particle spectrum. The new scheme is able to cover all
temperatures, including the critical temperature interval that marks the onset
of Bose--Einstein condensation, and reveals in analytical detail how this onset
leads to sharp features in gases with a fixed number of particles. In
particular, within the canonical ensemble the crossover from the
high-temperature asymptotics to the condensate regime occurs in an
error-function-like manner; this error function reduces to a step function when
the particle number becomes large. Our saddle-point formulas for occupation
numbers and their fluctuations, verified by numerical calculations, clearly
bring out the special role played by the ground state.

\leq T \leq 0.9 T_{c}$, where $T_{c}$ is the critical temperature. While
$g_{A}$ at T=0 is $q^{2}$-independent, it develops a $q^{2}$ dependence at
finite temperature. We then obtain the mean square radius associated with
$g_{A}$ and find that it diverges at $T=T_{c}$, thus signalling quark
deconfinement. As a byproduct, we study the temperature dependence of the
Goldberger-Treiman relation.

reduction for constant loops to integrable motion on the group manifold.
Finally, we generalise T-duality in the Hamiltonian formulation to group
factorisations $D=G\dcross M$ where the subgroups need not be dual or even have
the same dimension and need not be connected to the Drinfeld double or to
Poisson structures.

state interactions and Fermi-Dirac statistics, is related to the space-time
characteristics of proton emission. The measured source sizes are smaller than
the size of the target lead nucleus but larger than the sizes of the
projectiles. A dependence on the collision centrality is observed; the source
size increases with decreasing impact parameter. Proton source sizes near
midrapidity appear to be smaller than those of pions in the same interactions.
Quantitative agreement with the results of RQMD (v1.08) simulations is found

larger source size or larger contribution of protons from long-lived particle
