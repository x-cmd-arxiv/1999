systems. Two complementary derivations using Press-Schechter theory are given,
both of which result in the same equation for the formation rate. First, a
derivation using the properties of the Brownian random walks within the
framework of Press-Schechter theory is presented. We then use Bayes' theorem to
obtain the same result from the standard Press-Schechter mass function. The
rate obtained is shown to be in good agreement with results from Monte-Carlo
and N-body simulations. We illustrate the usefulness of this formula by
calculating the expected cosmological evolution in the rate of star formation
that is due to short-lived, merger-induced starbursts. The calculated evolution
is well-matched to the observed evolution in ultraviolet luminosity density, in
contrast to the lower rates of evolution that are derived from semi-analytic
models that do not include a dominant contribution from starbursts. Hence we
suggest that the bulk of the observed ultraviolet starlight at z > 1 arises
from short-lived, merger-induced starbursts. Finally, we show that a simple
merging-halo model can also account for the bulk of the observed evolution in
the comoving quasar space density.

ropes embedded in a streamer erupting, thus disrupting the streamer. The data
span a period of two years near sunspot minimum through a period of increased
activity as sunspot numbers increased. We have used LASCO data from the C2
coronagraph which records Thomson scattered white light from coronal electrons
at heights between 1.5 and 6R_sun. Maps of the coronal streamers have been
constructed from LASCO C2 observations at a height of 2.5R_sun at the east and
west limbs. We have superposed the corresponding positions of CMEs observed
with the C2 coronagraph onto the synoptic maps. We identified the different
kinds of signatures CMEs leave on the streamer structure at this height
(2.5R_sun). We find four types of CMEs with respect to their effect on
streamers:
  1. CMEs that disrupt the streamer 2. CMEs that have no effect on the
streamer, even though they are related to it. 3. CMEs that create streamer-like
structures 4. CMEs that are latitudinally displaced from the streamer.
  This is the most extensive observational study of the relation between CMEs
and streamers to date. Previous studies using SMM data have made the general
statement that CMEs are mostly associated with streamers, and that they
frequently disrupt it. However, we find that approximately 35% of the observed
CMEs bear no relation to the pre-existing streamer, while 46% have no effect on
the observed streamer, even though they appear to be related to it. Our
conclusions thus differ considerably from those of previous studies.

cosmic microwave background (CMB) and starlight Comptonization, and Faraday
rotation. Re-activation of the electron population in shock waves of
cosmological structure formation, which seems to lead to the cluster radio
relic phenomena. We discuss the role radio ghosts can have: They are able to
store relativistic particles for cosmological times, but are also able to
release them under the influence of very strong turbulence. This might happen
during a major merger event of clusters of galaxies. The released relativistic
proton population could produce the observed radio halos of some cluster of
galaxies via hadronic reactions with the background gas leading to the

engine consisting of a black hole with an external magnetic field anchored in a
surrounding disk or torus. The energy source is then the rotation of the black
hole, and it is extracted electromagnetically via a Poynting flux, a mechanism
first proposed by Blandford and Znajek (1997) for AGN. Accounting both for the
maximum rotation energy of the hole and for the efficiency of electromagnetic
extraction, we find that a maximum of 9% of the rest mass of the hole can be
converted to a Poynting flow, i.e. the energy available to produce a gamma-ray
burst is 1.6 X 10^{53}M/M_{sun}erg for a black hole of mass M. We show that the
black holes formed in a variety of gamma-rayburst scenarios probably contain
the required high angular momentum. To extract the energy from a black hole in
the required time \lsim1000s a field of 10^{15}G near the black hole is needed.
We give an example of a disk-plus-field structure that both delivers the
required field and makes the Poynting flux from the hole dominate that ofthe
disk. Thereby we demonstrate that the Poynting energy extracted need not be
dominated by the disk, nor is limited to the binding energy of the disk. This
means that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism remains a very good candidate for
powering gamma-ray bursts.

possible to treat the ideal gas exactly so that one can easily see how standard

clearly sees that the condensate is made up of very long permutation loops
whose length fluctuates ever more wildly as the number of particles increases.
In the TDL, the WKB approximation, equivalent to the standard approach to BEC,
becomes precise for the non-condensate; however, this approximation neglects
completely the long cycles that make up the condensate. We examine the exact

communication of SUSY breaking through a messenger sector, and the generation
of flavor using the Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) mechanism are exploited, leading to
the identification of vector-like messenger fields with FN fields, and the
messenger U(1) as a flavor symmetry. An immediate consequence is that the first
and second generation scalars acquire flavor-dependent masses, but do not
violate FCNC bounds since their mass scale, consistent with effective SUSY, is
of order 10 TeV. We define and advocate a minimal flavor-mediated model (MFMM),
recently introduced in the literature, that successfully accommodates the small
flavor-breaking parameters of the standard model using order one couplings and
ratios of flavon field vevs. The mediation of SUSY breaking occurs via two-loop
log-enhanced GM contributions, as well as several one-loop and two-loop
Yukawa-mediated contributions for which we provide analytical expressions. The
MFMM is parameterized by a small set of masses and couplings, with values
restricted by several model constraints and experimental data. The
next-to-lightest sparticle (NLSP) always has a decay length that is larger than
the scale of a detector, and is either the lightest stau or the lightest
neutralino. Similar to ordinary GM models, the best collider search strategies
are, respectively, inclusive production of at least one highly ionizing track,
or events with many taus plus missing energy. In addition, D^0 - \bar{D}^0
mixing is also a generic low energy signal. Finally, the dynamical generation

Lie algebras, can be appropriately defined also for affine Lie algebras. This
allows us to classify all the weights of an affine Weyl orbit explicitly. Let
$\Lambda$ be a dominant weight of an affine Lie algebra $ G_N^{(r)} $ for
r=1,2,3. At each and every order M of weight depths, the set $\wp_M(\Lambda)$
of permutation weights is formed out of a finite number of dominant weights of
the finite Lie algebra $G_N$. In case of $A_N^{(1)}$ algebras, we give the
rules to determine the elements of a $\wp_M(\Lambda)$ completely. As being a
positive test of our proposal, we consider the problem of calculating weight
multiplicities for affine Lie algebras and hence our discussions are based on
explicit computations of Weyl-Kac character formula. It is known that weight
multiplicities are provided by string functions which are defined to be formal
power series $\sum_{M=0}^\infty C(M) q^M$ where the order M specifies the depth
of weights contributing to C(M). In the conventional calculational schemes
which are based on Kac-Peterson form of affine Weyl groups, Weyl-Kac formula
includes a sum over a part of the whole root lattice and hence it is seen that
the roots of the same length contribute in general to C(M) for several values
of M. On the contrary, we will determine, for any fixed value of M, the
complete set of weights having depth M and contributing only to C(M). For
applications of Weyl-Kac formula, one must also know the signatures which
correspond to weights within the Weyl orbits of strictly dominant weights. This
is given by the aid of a properly defined index. Another emphasis is that the
way of discussion adopted here gives us a possibility for extensions to other
infinite dimensional Lie algebras beyond affine Lie algebras.

  Communications in Analysis and Geometry","Comm. Anal. Geom 9 (2001) no.2 423-449",,,"math.DG math.AG",,"  This article shows that every non-isotropic harmonic 2-torus in complex
projective space factors through a generalised Jacobi variety related to the
spectral curve. Each map is composed of a homomorphism into the variety and a
rational map off it. The same ideas allow one to construct (pluri)-harmonic
maps of finite type from Euclidean space into Grassmannians and the projective
unitary groups. Further, some of these maps will be purely algebraic. For maps
into complex projective space the algebraic maps of the plane are always doubly
periodic i.e. they yield 2-tori. The classification of all these algebraic maps
remains open.

algebras of operators on a Hilbert space, and modules over such algebras,
developing a little more technology to connect `nonselfadjoint operator
algebra' with the C$^*-$algebraic framework. More particularly, we make use of
the universal, or maximal, C$^*-$algebra generated by an operator algebra, and
C$^*-$dilations. This technology is quite general, however it was developed to
solve some problems arising in the theory of Morita equivalence of operator
algebras, and as a result most of the applications given here (and in a
companion paper) are to that subject. Other applications given here are to
extension problems for module maps, and characterizations of C$^*-$algebras.

"math/9906082","David P. Blecher","David P. Blecher","On Morita's Fundamental Theorem for C*-algebras",,,,,"math.OA math.CT math.RA",,"  We give a solution, via operator spaces, of an old problem in the Morita
equivalence of C*-algebras. Namely, we show that C*-algebras are strongly
Morita equivalent in the sense of Rieffel if and only if their categories of
left operator modules are isomorphic via completely contractive functors.
Moreover, any such functor is completely isometrically isomorphic to the
Haagerup tensor product (= interior tensor product) with a strong Morita
equivalence bimodule. An operator module over a C$^*-$algebra $\A$ is a closed
subspace of some B(H) which is left invariant under multiplication by
$\pi(\A)$, where $\pi$ is a *-representation of $\A$ on $H$. The category
$_{\A}HMOD$ of *-representations of $\A$ on Hilbert space is a full subcategory
of the category $_{\A}OMOD$ of operator modules. Our main result remains true
with respect to subcategories of $OMOD$ which contain $HMOD$ and the
C$^*-$algebra itself. It does not seem possible to remove the operator space
framework; in the very simplest cases there may exist no bounded equivalence
functors on categories with bounded module maps as morphisms (as opposed to
completely bounded ones). Our proof involves operator space techniques,
together with a C$^*-$algebra argument using compactness of the quasistate
space of a C$^*-$algebra, and lowersemicontinuity in the enveloping von Neumann
algebra.

  theorems","This is the final revised version",,,,"math.OA math.FA",,"  We study operator spaces, operator algebras, and operator modules, from the
point of view of the `noncommutative Shilov boundary'. In this attempt to
utilize some `noncommutative Choquet theory', we find that Hilbert
C$^*-$modules and their properties, which we studied earlier in the operator
space framework, replace certain topological tools. We introduce certain
multiplier operator algebras and C$^*-$algebras of an operator space, which
generalize the algebras of adjointable operators on a C$^*-$module, and the
`imprimitivity C$^*-$algebra'. It also generalizes a classical Banach space
notion. This multiplier algebra plays a key role here. As applications of this
perspective, we unify, and strengthen several theorems characterizing operator
algebras and modules, in a way that seems to give more information than other
current proofs. We also include some general notes on the `commutative case' of
some of the topics we discuss, coming in part from joint work with Christian Le
Merdy, about `function modules'.
