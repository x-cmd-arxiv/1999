Bremsstrahlung at high energy lead to longer tracks for heavier leptons.
Radiation lenght grows nearly with the square of the lepton mass. Indeed
electrons are too light and their trace in matter (liquid or rock) is
negligible (tens of centimeters); muons are much better observed, while tau are
too short life time and too short range to be found. However, because
relativistic time expansion, UHE tau traces in matter, above $10^{17} eV$, are
relativistically boosted overcoming the corresponding muon tracks, already
bounded by bremsstrahlung logarithmic regime. The tau crossing for Kms in water

misunderstood as muonic catastrophic bremsstrahlung interactions. To economize
UHE tau discovery, we suggest to look the tau decay in air into the deep
valleys mountains, like Canyons or deep in excavation mines where horizontal
air showers induce fluorescent or Cerenkov lights. The mountain valley width
screens from horizontal secondary muons. The valley height increases the solid

derived from HST + NICMOS observations with the F110W and F160W filters. The

discrepancy related to these data is that the dark matter is more centrally
condensed than the X-ray-emitting gas, and also with respect to the galaxy
distribution (Eyles et al. 1991). Could these discrepancies be consequence of
the standard description of the ICM, in which it is assumed hydrostatic
equilibrium maintained by thermal pressure? We follow the evolution of the ICM,
considering a term of magnetic pressure, aiming at answering the question
whether or not these discrepancies can be explained via non-thermal terms of
pressure. Our results suggest that the magnetic pressure could only affect the
dynamics of the ICM on scales as small as < 1kpc. Our models are constrained by
the observations of large and small scale fields and we are successful at
reproducing available data, for both Faraday rotation limits and inverse
Compton limits for the magnetic fields. In our calculations the radius (from
the cluster center) in which magnetic pressure reaches equipartition is smaller
than radii derived in previous works, as a consequence of the more realistic
treatment of the magnetic field geometry and the consideration of a sink term
in the cooling flow.

M_gas(R<500pc) = 10^8 - 10^9 M_sun are found to be prevalent in the gas-rich

found to be higher in barred systems than in unbarred galaxies. This is the
first statistical evidence for the higher central concentration of molecular
gas in barred galaxies, and it strongly supports the theory of bar-driven gas
transport. It is most likely that more than half of molecular gas within the
central kpc of a barred galaxy was transported there from outside by the bar.
The supply of gas has exceeded the consumption of gas by star formation in the
central kpc, resulting in the excess gas in the centers of barred systems. The
mean rate of gas inflow is statistically estimated to be larger than 0.1 - 1
M_sun/yr.
  The correlation between gas properties in the central kpc and the type of
nuclear spectrum (HII, LINER, or Seyfert) is investigated. A correlation is
found in which galaxies with larger gas-to-dynamical mass ratios tend to have
HII nuclear spectra, while galaxies with smaller ratios show spectra indicating
AGN.
  Also, the theoretical prediction of bar-dissolution by condensation of gas to
galactic centers is observationally tested. It is suggested that the timescale
for bar dissolution is larger than 10^8 - 10^10 yr, or a bar in a L^* galaxy is
not destroyed by a condensation of 10^8 - 10^9 M_sun gas in the central kpc.

an excess of stars at V_o=17.85 and 0.9 < (V-I)_o < 1.1 in the (l,b) = (11,-40)

deeper CMD imaging in these locations shows evidence of a main-sequence turnoff

surface brightnesses we derive from either the potential excess of red clump
stars or the apparent excess of MSTO stars are consistent with each other and
with the results of other surveys at this latitude. No similar excess appears
in our northern Galactic hemisphere fields near l=353, b=+41 field.

distribution of the stars, while dissimilar from expectations of Galactic
structure models, does not show a contribution by stars near the Galactocentric
radial velocity seen in other studies near the Sgr core. It is difficult to
reconcile a photometric result that is consistent with other explorations of
the Sagittarius stream with a radial velocity distribution that is apparently
inconsistent.

these models. The properties of stars 10-15 degrees away from the center of Sgr
--- in particular, the orientation of material perpendicular to Sgr's orbit
(c.f. Alard 1996) and the kink in the velocity gradient (Ibata et al 1997) ---
are consistent with those expected for unbound material stripped during the
most recent pericentric passage ~50 Myrs ago. The break in the slope of the
surface density seen by Mateo, Olszewski & Morrison (1998) at ~ b=-35 can be
understood as marking the end of this material. However, the detections beyond
this point are unlikely to represent debris in a trailing streamer, torn from
Sgr during the immediately preceding passage ~0.7 Gyrs ago, but are more
plausibly explained by a leading streamer of material that was lost more that 1
Gyr ago and has wrapped all the way around the Galaxy. The observations
reported in Majewski et al (1999) also support this hypothesis. We determine
debris models with these properties on orbits that are consistent with the
currently known positions and velocities of Sgr in Galactic potentials with
halo components that have circular velocities v_circ=140-200 km/s. The best
match to the data is obtained in models where Sgr currently has a mass of ~10^9
M_sun and has orbited the Galaxy for at least the last 1 Gyr, during which time
it has reduced its mass by a factor of 2-3, or luminosity by an amount
equivalent to ~10% of the total luminosity of the Galactic halo. These numbers
suggest that Sgr is rapidly disrupting and unlikely to survive beyond a few
more pericentric passages.

that, of all four-dimensional curved spacetime theories of gravity viable with
respect to the four classical weak field tests, only one unique case, the

Robertson's explanation of the large energy output of the gamma ray burster GRB

(a 1-body solution with horizon) to the case of horizon-free interactive N-body
solutions. In addition to the good news that the long sought N-body solutions
are found, this unique case enjoys further strong support from other areas of
gravitational physics. This development does not rule out GRB models with
beaming, which can be used if warranted, but it provides a consistent basis for
them, as only in an interactive multiparticle context can such models be

lower in the Trapezium Cluster than in Taurus-Auriga. We investigate if this
difference can be explained through stellar encounters in dense clusters. To
this effect, a range of possible models of the well observed Trapezium Cluster
are calculated using Aarseth's direct N-body code, which treats binaries
accurately. The results are confronted with observational constraints. The
range of models include clusters in virial equilibrium, expanding clusters as a
result of instantaneous mass loss, as well as collapsing clusters. In all cases
the primordial binary proportion is larger than 50 per cent, with initial
period distributions as observed in Taurus-Auriga and the Galactic field.
  It is found that the expanding model, with an initial binary population as in
the Galactic field, is most consistent with the observational constraints. This
raises the possibility that the primordial group of OB stars may have expelled
the cluster gas roughly 50 000 yr ago. The cluster's bulk expansion rate is
thus a key observable that needs to be determined. The other models demonstrate
that the rapidly decreasing binary proportion, its radial dependence and the
form of the period distribution, together with structural and kinematical data,
are very useful diagnostics on the present and past dynamical state of a young
cluster. In particular, kinematical cooling from the disruption of wide

a slightly elongated structure, while the spectroscopy shows a continuum break
that allows us to determine the redshift of z = 1.58 + 0.01/-0.03 for this
system. The fits of a range of models to the infrared spectrum suggests that it
is predominantly an old (> 10^9 yrs) stellar system that suffers little
extinction, while the measurerd R and I magnitudes suggests an age of ~ 3 x
10^8 years. The limit on the equivalent width of any emission line in the
infrared spectrum argues that CL 0939+4713 B is not an actively star forming
galaxy. This system, though similar in R-K color to HR 10 [also known as
J1645+46] (Dey et al. 1999), is much different in morphology and emission line
strengths, demonstrating the heterogeneity of extremely red extragalactic
objects (EROs) selected on the basis of large values of R-K.

velocities for stars belonging to eleven, heavily-reddened globular clusters in
the direction of the inner Galaxy. The question of kinematic substructuring
among the Galactic globular cluster system is investigated using an updated
catalog of globular cluster distances, metallicities and velocities. It is
found that the population of metal-rich globular clusters shows significant
rotation at all Galactocentric radii. For the metal-rich clusters within 4 kpc
of the Galactic center, the measured rotation velocity and line-of-sight
velocity dispersion are similar to those of bulge field stars. We investigate
claims that the metal-rich clusters are associated with the central Galactic
bar by comparing the kinematics of the innermost clusters to that of the atomic
hydrogen in the inner Galaxy. The longitude-velocity diagram of both metal-rich
and metal-poor clusters bears a remarkable similarity to that of the gas,
including the same non-circular motions which have traditionally been
interpreted as evidence for a Galactic bar, or, alternatively, a
non-axisymmetric bulge. However, uncertainties in the existing
three-dimensional Galactocentric positions for most of the clusters do not yet
allow an unambiguous discrimination between the competing scenarios of
membership in a rigidly rotating bar, or in a bulge which is an oblate
isotropic rotator. We conclude that the majority of metal-rich clusters within
the central 4 kpc of the Galaxy are probably associated with the bulge/bar, and
not the thick disk. (ABRIDGED)

formation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center.
Throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older mean
stellar populations than field galaxies. From the subsample of galaxies more
luminous than M_r=-18.8 + 5log h, we identify a sample of K+A galaxies, which
may result from recently terminated star formation. Corrected for a systematic
effect which results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral index
measurements, we estimate that K+A galaxies make up only 1.5 +/- 0.8 % of the
cluster sample, and 1.2 +/- 0.8 % of the field. We compare our data with
spectrophotometric models and conclude that up to 1.9 +/- 0.8 % of the cluster
population may have had its star formation recently truncated without a
starburst. However, this is still not significantly greater than the fraction
of such galaxies in the field, 3.1 +/- 1.0 %. Furthermore, we do not detect an
excess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone a starburst within
the last 1 Gyr. Our results imply that these cluster environments are not
responsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxy
fraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster--specific phenomenon. We
suggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be a
gradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disk over
fairly long timescales.

function shows that the dust shell contributes 40% to the total flux and the
unresolved central object 60%. Radiative transfer calculations have been
performed to model both the spectral energy distribution and visibility
function. The grain sizes, a, were found to be in accordance with a standard
distribution function, n(a)~a^(-3.5), with 0.005 micron < a < 0.45 micron. The
observed dust shell properties cannot be fitted by single-shell models but seem
to require multiple components. At a certain distance we considered an
enhancement over the assumed 1/r^x density distribution. The best model for
both SED and visibility was found for a dust shell with a dust temperature of
1000K at its inner radius of 69Rstar. At a distance of 308Rstar the density was
enhanced by a factor of 40 and and its density exponent was changed from x=2 to
x=1.7. The shell's intensity distribution was found to be ring-like.The ring
diameter is equal to the inner diameter of the hot shell (69mas). The diameter

scale-dependent bias is a property of not only the two-point halo correlation
function, but also of correlation functions of higher order.

time scales and 2) the adsorption rate is limited by geometric blockage from
previously adsorbed particles. A coarse-grained description that encompasses
these two properties is provided by sequential adsorption models whose simplest
example is the random sequential adsorption (RSA) process. In this article, we
review the theoretical formalism and tools that allow the systematic study of
kinetic and structural aspects of these sequential adsorption models. We also

that permit natural specification of systems and allow mathematical reasoning
about their correctness. The availability of fully-automated reasoning tools
enables more non-specialists to use formal methods effectively --- their
responsibility reduces to just specifying the model and expressing the desired
properties. Thus, it is essential that these properties be represented in a
language that is easy to use and sufficiently expressive.
  Linear-time temporal logic is a formalism that has been extensively used by
researchers for specifying properties of systems. When such properties are
closed under stuttering, i.e. their interpretation is not modified by
transitions that leave the system in the same state, verification tools can
utilize a partial-order reduction technique to reduce the size of the model and
thus analyze larger systems. If LTL formulas do not contain the ``next''
operator, the formulas are closed under stuttering, but the resulting language
is not expressive enough to capture many important properties, e.g., properties
involving events. Determining if an arbitrary LTL formula is closed under
stuttering is hard --- it has been proven to be PSPACE-complete.
  In this paper we relax the restriction on LTL that guarantees closure under
stuttering, introduce the notion of edges in the context of LTL, and provide
theorems that enable syntactic reasoning about closure under stuttering of LTL
formulas.

determined the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies of stable boson stars in
spherical symmetry. The study was carried out in the standard Einstein theory

of these objects in Brans-Dicke theory showing that they can form from the

studies of boson star dynamics in full 3+1 dimension. One focus of the 3D study
was on the validation of the numerical code constructed to solve Einstein
equations with matter sources. Boson Stars do not suffer from the surface
problems of neutron stars or the singularities of black holes. The code was
first tested with spherical perturbations and compared with the spherical
results. We determined the coordinate conditions needed to provide stable
evolutions. We then went on to study their behavior under non-spherical
perturbations. We reproduced the QNM frequencies of the stars, as determined by
perturbation studies carried out by other groups. The energy generated by the
perturbation was studied with different radiation indicators. We also observed
the collapse to black holes of unstable boson-star configurations. We simulated
the collision of two boson stars. This is of interest as the two body problem
is as yet unresolved in general relativity.

motivation for introducing in the system's Hamiltonian an interaction term. The
interaction contains the horizon area operator, which is a number operator, and
its canonical conjugate, the phase operator. The Hawking radiation from a
Schwarzschild black hole is seen to be a consequence of an area-phase
interaction. Using this interaction we have reproduced the semi-classical
result for the Hawking radiation power. Furthermore, we show that the initial
state of the black hole determines the nature of its development. Thus, a state
which is an area eigenstate describes a static eternal black hole, but a
coherent state describes a radiating black hole. Hence, it is the observer's
initial knowledge or uncertainty about the horizon area which determines the
evolution.

momentum spectrum in semileptonic decays and b quark fragmentation. The average
fraction of the beam energy carried by the weakly decaying b hadron, xe, is
measured to be <xe> = 0.709 +- 0.003(stat.) +- 0.003 (syst.) +- 0.013(model)

such limits, estimates must be made of the production rate of such monopoles at
the Tevatron collider, and of the binding strength of any such produced
monopoles to matter. Here we sketch the still primitive theory of such

Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian together with duality could be employed to set
limits on magnetic monopoles having masses less than 1 TeV, based on virtual,
rather than real processes. The D0 collaboration at Fermilab has used such a
proposal to set mass limits based on the nonobservation of pairs of photons
each with high transverse momentum. We critique the underlying theory, by
showing that the cross section violates unitarity at the quoted limits and is
unstable with respect to radiative corrections. We therefore believe that no
significant limit can be obtained from the current experiments, based on

As a result, the cosmological moduli fields should decay before big-bang
nucleosynthesis starts. Furthermore, in the anomaly-mediated scenario, the
lightest superparticle (LSP) is the Wino-like neutralino. Although the large
annihilation cross section means the thermal relic density of the Wino LSP is
too small to be the dominant component of cold dark matter (CDM), moduli decays
can produce Winos in sufficient abundance to constitute CDM. If Winos are
indeed the dark matter, it will be highly advantageous from the point of view
of detection. If the halo density is dominated by the Wino-like LSP, the
detection rate of Wino CDM in Ge detectors can be as large as $0.1 - 0.01$
event/kg/day, which is within the reach of the future CDM detection with Ge
detector. Furthermore, there is a significant positron signal from pair
annihilation of Winos in our galaxy which should give a spectacular signal at

out (but not neglecting) the effective antiquark fields, we present a new

effective theory (HQET) and exhibits valuable features because of the inclusion
of the contributions from the antiquark fields. Matrix elements of vector and
axial vector heavy quark currents between pseudoscalar and vector mesons
containing a heavy quark (b or c) are then evaluated systematically up to the
order of $1/m^2_Q$ and parameterized by a set of universal form factors. With a
consistent normalization condition between the effective heavy hadron states,
the form factors at zero recoil are related to the ground state meson masses,
which enables us to estimate the values of form factors at zero recoil. In
particular, the Luke's theorem comes out automatically in the new formulation
of HQEFT without the need of imposing the equation of motion $iv\cdot D
Q^{+}_{v} =0$. Consequently, the differential decay rates of both $B\to
D^{\ast}l\nu$ and $B\to D l\nu$ do not receive $1/m_{Q}$ order corrections at

changed by the quantum corrections in oscillating cosmologies and evolves with
time in the non-oscillating cases. Similarities between the two and three

cosmologies: Anisotropy seems to be a generic unavoidable feature, cosmological
singularities are generically avoided and it is possible to construct
non-singular cosmologies where some spatial dimensions are experiencing

supersymmetric orientifold models. For illustrative purposes we consider two
explicit orientifold models previously constructed in hep-th/9806008. In both
of these models branes are stabilized at a finite distance from the orientifold
planes. In the first model brane stabilization occurs via supersymmetry
preserving non-perturbative gauge dynamics. In the second model supersymmetry
is dynamically broken, and brane stabilization is due to an interplay between
non-perturbatively generated superpotential and tree-level Kahler potential.

space is addressed, by using the derivative of the operator's zeta-function
(following Ray and Singer) and, eventually, through its zeta-function trace. A
little play with operators as simple as $\pm I$ ($I$ being the identity
operator) and variations thereof, shows that the presence of a non-commutative
anomaly (i.e., the fact that det $(AB) \neq$ det $A$ det $B$), is unavoidable,
even for commuting and, remarkably, also for almost constant operators. In the
case of Dirac-type operators, similarly basic arguments lead to the conclusion
---contradicting common lore--- that in spite of being $\det (\slash D +im) =
\det (\slash D -im)$ (as follows from the symmetry condition of the $\slash
D$-spectrum), it turns out that these determinants may {\it not} be equal to
$\sqrt{\det (\slash D^2 +m^2)}$, simply because $\det [(\slash D +im) (\slash D
-im)] \neq \det (\slash D +im) \det (\slash D -im)$. A proof of this fact is
given, by way of a very simple example, using operators with an
harmonic-oscillator spectrum and fulfilling the symmetry condition. This
anomaly can be physically relevant if, in addition to a mass term (or instead
of it), a chemical potential contribution is added to the Dirac operator.

linear subspaces in general position to obtain generic points of the components

solution of a number of larger overdetermined systems, the procedure is
computationally expensive and also wasteful because many solution paths
diverge. In this article an embedding of the original polynomial system is
presented, which leads to a sequence of homotopies, with solution paths leading
to generic points of all components as the isolated solutions of an auxiliary

auroral E region are reported. We found intriguing evidence that a modification
of the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling, due to the effects of powerful HF
waves beamed into an auroral sporadic E layer, can lead to a local
intensification of the auroral activity. Summarizing multi-instrument
ground-based observations and observations from the IMP 8 and IMP 9 satellites,
one can distinguish the following peculiarities related to this auroral
activation: modification of the auroral arc and its break-up above Tromso;
local changes of the horizontal currents in the vicinity of Tromso; increase of
the electron temperature and ion velocities at altitudes above the HF pump
reflection level; distinctive features in dynamic HF radio scatter Doppler
spectra; pump-induced electron precipitation; substorm activation exactly above
Tromso. The mechanisms of the modification of the ionosphere-magnetosphere
coupling through the excitation of the turbulent Alfven boundary layer between
the base of the ionosphere (~100 km) and the level of sharp increase of the
Alfven velocity (at heights up to one Earth radius), and the formation of a
local magnetospheric current system are discussed. The results suggest that a
possible triggering of local auroral activation requires specific geophysical
conditions.
