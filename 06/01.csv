X-ray cluster MS1054-03 at z=0.83. The sample consists of 81 spectroscopically
confirmed cluster members in a 3 x 2 Mpc area imaged in F606W and F814W with
WFPC2. We find thirteen ongoing mergers in MS1054-03, comprising 17% of the L >
L* cluster population. Most of these mergers will likely evolve into luminous
(\sim 2 L*) elliptical galaxies, and some may evolve into S0 galaxies. Assuming
the galaxy population in MS1054-03 is typical for its redshift it is estimated
that \sim 50% of present-day cluster ellipticals experienced a major merger at
z < 1. The mergers are preferentially found in the outskirts of the cluster,
and probably occur in small infalling clumps. Morphologies, spectra, and colors
of the mergers show that their progenitors were typically E/S0s or early-type
spirals with mean stellar formation redshifts z* \gtrsim 1.7. The red colors of
the merger remnants are consistent with the low scatter in the color-magnitude
relation in rich clusters at lower redshift. The discovery of a high fraction
of mergers in this young cluster is direct evidence against formation of
ellipticals in a single ``monolithic'' collapse at high redshift, and in
qualitative agreement with predictions of hierarchical models for structure
formation.

massive starburst.
  We furthermore show how the optical and near-infrared morphology of a

of the burst to be carried by slow moving shells that were ejected at late
times. These slow shells collide with faster moving outer shells when the outer
shells have slowed down as a result of sweeping up material from the ISM. This
gives rise to a forward shock that moves into the outer shell producing a bump
in the afterglow light curve of amplitude roughly proportional to the ratio of
the energy in the inner and the outer shells. In addition, a reverse shock
propagates in the inner shell and produces emission at a characteristic
frequency that is typically much smaller than the peak of the emission from the
outer shell by a factor of $\sim 7 \gamma_{0c}^2 (E_2/E_1)^{1.1}$, and the
observed flux at this frequency from the reverse shock is larger compared to
the flux from the outer shell by a factor of $\sim 8 (\gamma_{0c}
E_2/E_1)^{5/3} $; where $\gamma_{0c}$ is the bulk Lorentz factor of the outer
shell at the time of collision, and $E_1 & E_2$ are the total energy in the
outer and the inner shells respectively. The Lorentz factor is related to the
observer time as $\sim 5 (t/day)^{3/8}$. The shell collision could produce
initial temporal variability in the early afterglow signal. The lack of
significant deviation from a power-law decline of the optical afterglow from
half a dozen bursts suggests that $E_2/E_1$ is small. Future multi-wavelength
observations should be able to either detect bumps in the light curve
corresponding to both the forward and the reverse shocks or further constrain
the late time release of energy in ejecta with small Lorentz factor, which is
expected generically in the internal shock models for the gamma-ray bursts.

another evolved one, associated with the IRAS sources 00338+6312 and 03595+5110

mapped simultaneously in two far infrared bands at 143 & 185 \micron), with
about 1.5 arcmin angular resolution, using the TIFR 100 cm balloon borne
telescope. The HIRES processed IRAS maps at 12, 25, 60 & 100 \micron, have been
used for comparison. Whereas IRAS 00338+6312 is resolved only in the TIFR
bands, RAFGL 5111 is very well resolved in both the TIFR bands, as well as in
at least 3 IRAS bands. The neighbouring fainter source IRAS 04004+5114 has also
been resolved in the TIFR bands. Taking advantage of the identical beams in the
two TIFR bands at 143 & 185 \micron, dust colour temperature, $T(143/185)$, and
optical depth, $\tau_{150}$, maps have been generated for RAFGL 5111. These
maps show interesting structural details. Radiative transfer modelling in
spherical geometry has been carried out for individual sources. The best fit
models are in good agreement with the observed spectral energy distribution
(SED), radio continuum data etc. Another scheme of radiative transfer through
the interstellar dust-gas cloud including the heavier elements has been used to
predict ionic nebular line emission, which are in reasonable agreement with the
measurements for RAFGL 5111. An important conclusion from the present study is
that, for all the three sources (IRAS 00338+6312; 03595+5110; and 04004+5114, a
faint source in the neighbourhood of RAFGL 5111), the best fit to the observed

luminosity of the central object normalized by the Eddington luminosity. %If
the central object is a compact star with a luminous accretion disk, the
radiation field becomes ``non-spherical''. %Although the gravitional field
remains spherical. In such a case the axial symmetry around the accretion axis
breaks down; the accretion radius $R_{acc}$ generally depends on an inclination
angle $i$ between the accretion axis and the symmetry axis of the disk and the
azimuthal angle $\phi$ around the accretion axis. %That is, the cross section
of accretion changes its shape. Hence, the accretion rate $\dot{M}$, which is
obtained by integrating $R_{acc}$ around $\phi$, depends on $i$. % as well as
$M$, $\Gamma$, and $v_\infty$. %In the case of an edge-on accretion
($i=90^{\circ}$), The accretion rate is larger than that of the spherical case
and approximately expressed as $\dot{M} \sim \dot{M}_{HL} (1-\Gamma)$ for
$\Gamma \leq 0.65$ and $\dot{M} \sim \dot{M}_{HL} (2-\Gamma)^2/5$ for $\Gamma
\geq 0.65$. %Once the accretion disk forms and the anisotropic radiation fields
are produced around the central object,the accretion plane will be maintained
automatically (the direction of jets associated with the disk is also
maintained). %Thus, the anisotropic radiation field of accretion disks
drastically changes the accretion nature, that gives a clue to the formation of
accretion disks around an isolated black hole.

virtually identical to that of non-BAL QSOs when the spectra of the former are

on measurement of the flux in three bands and determination of the colour
excess in comparison with an unreddened spectrum. This method allows us to
derive the type and amount of extinction. We show that reddening in
high-ionization BAL QSOs is comparatively small and the range of extinction
laws varies from Milky Way, LMC to SMC type. On the other hand, low-ionization
BAL QSOs seem to experience reddening which can be attributed to SMC type
extinction alone. Comparison of the colour indices of composite spectra from
Francis etal. (1991) and Zheng etal. (1997) with those derived from individual
BAL QSO spectra shows that the Francis etal. (1991) composite might be a more
suitable representative of an unreddened spectrum. In general, we conclude that
the spectral energy distribution of normal QSOs can be used as an incident
continuum shape for BAL QSOs.

there exist many structure functions: 108 in general and 22 in the \vec

present the strongest constraint on Im Z_{ds}. Assuming 1.5 10^{-3} <
epsilon'/epsilon < 3 10^{-3} and Standard Model values for the CKM parameters
we obtain the bounds BR(K_L -> pi^0 nu nubar) < 3.9 10^{-10} and BR(K_L -> pi^0
e^+ e^-)_{dir} < 7.9 10^{-11}. Using the bound on Re Z_{ds} from K_L -> mu^+
mu^- we find BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nubar) < 2.6 10^{-10}. We also discuss new
physics scenarios in which in addition to an enhanced sbar d Z vertex also
neutral meson mixing receives important new contributions. In this case our
most conservative bounds are BR(K_L -> pi^0 nu nubar) < 1.8 10^{-9}, BR(K_L ->
pi^0 e^+ e^-)_{dir} < 2.8 10^{-10} and BR(K^+ -> pi^+ nu nubar) < 6.1 10^{-10}.
The dependence of the upper bound for BR(K_L -> pi^0 nu nubar) on the CKM

The polarized diffractive amplitude receives sizable contributions from
non-strongly ordered regions in phase space, resulting in a double logarithmic
enhancement at small $x$. The resummation of these double logarithmic terms is
outlined. We also discuss the transition from our perturbative expression to
the nonperturbative region. A first numerical estimate indicates that the

nuclei of $g_{9/2}$- and $f_{7/2}$ subshell are studied using a schematic model

model interaction well reproduces observed physical quantities: the double
differences of binding energies, symmetry energy, Wigner energy, odd-even mass
difference and separation energy, which testifies the reliability of the model
interaction and its p-n interactions.
  First of all, the double differences of binding energies are used for probing
the p-n interactions. The analysis reveals different contributions of the
isoscalar and isovector p-n pairing interactions to two types of double
difference of binding energies, and also indicates the importance of a unique
form of isoscalar p-n pairing force with all $J$ components. Next, it is shown
that this p-n force is closely related to the symmetry energy and the Wigner
energy. Other calculations demonstrate significant roles of p-n interactions in
the odd-even mass difference and in the separation energy at $N=Z$.

formulation is based on a Feynman-type integral over trajectories that are
confined by the absorbing boundary. Trajectories that reach the absorbing wall
are instantaneously terminated and their probability is discounted from the
population of the surviving trajectories. This gives rise to a unidirectional
absorption current at the boundary. We calculate the survival probability as a
function of time. Several modes of absorption are derived from our formalism:
total absorption, absorption that depends on energy levels, and absorption of
non-interacting particles. Several applications are given: the slit experiment
with an absorbing screen and with absorbing lateral walls, and one dimensional
particle between two absorbing walls. The survival probability of a particle
between absorbing walls exhibits decay with beats.

things aren't that simple. Special relativity shows that `before' and `after'
are relative, and quantum measurement is even more subtle. Since the
nonlocality of Bell's theorem, it has been known that quantum measurement has
an uneasy relation with special relativity, described by Shimony as `peaceful
coexistence'. Hardy's theorem says that quantum measurement requires a
preferred Lorentz frame. The original proofs of the theorem depended on there
being no backward causality, even at the quantum level. In quant-ph/9803044
this condition was removed. It was only required that systems with classical
inputs and outputs had no causal loops. Here the conditions are weakened
further: there should be no forbidden causal loops as defined in the text. The
theory depends on a transfer function analysis, which is introduced in detail
before application to specific systems.
