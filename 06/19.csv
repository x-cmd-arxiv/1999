  version",,"10.1086/308732",,"astro-ph",,"  The stratification of entropy and the stratification of angular momentum are
closely analogous. Of particular interest is the behavior of disks in which
angular momentum transport is controlled by convection, and heat transport by
dynamical turbulence. In both instances we argue that the transport must
proceed ``backwards'' relative to the sense one would expect from a simple
enhanced diffusion approach. Reversed angular momentum transport has already
been seen in numerical simulations; contra-gradient thermal diffusion should be
amenable to numerical verification as well. These arguments also bear on the
observed nonlinear local stability of isolated Keplerian disks. We also
describe a diffusive instability that is the entropy analogue to the
magnetorotational instability. It affects thermally stratified layers when
Coulomb conduction and a weak magnetic field are present. The criterion for
convective instability goes from one of upwardly decreasing entropy to one of
upwardly decreasing temperature. The maximum growth rate is of order the
inverse sound crossing time, independent of the thermal conductivity. The
indifference of the growth rate to the conduction coefficient, its simple
dynamical scaling, and the replacement in the stability criterion of a
conserved quantity (entropy) gradient by a free energy (temperature) gradient
are properties similar to those exhibited by the magnetorotational instability.

not the gas is magnetically coupled. The presence of a subthermal field will
cause laminar flow to break down into turbulence. Magnetic coupling, in turn,
depends upon the ionization fraction of the gas. The inner most region of the
nebula ($\lesssim 0.1$ AU) is magnetically well-coupled, as is the outermost
region ($\gtrsim 10$ AU). The magnetic status of intermediate scales ($\sim 1$
AU) is less certain. It is plausible that there is a zone adjacent to the inner
disk in which turbulent heating self-consistently maintains the requisite
ionization levels. But the region adjacent to the active outer disk is likely
to be magnetically ``dead.'' Hall currents play a significant role in nebular
magnetohydrodynamics.
  Though still occasionally argued in the literature, there is simply no
evidence to support the once standard claim that differential rotation in a
Keplerian disk is prone to break down into shear turbulence by nonlinear
instabilities. There is abundant evidence---numerical, experimental, and
analytic---in support of the stabilizing role of Coriolis forces.
Hydrodynamical turbulence is almost certainly not a source of enhanced
turbulence in the solar nebula, or in any other astrophysical accretion disk.

radiation by accelerating objects results in a reaction force that may account,
at least in part, for inertia [1,2,3]. This arises because of asymmetries in
the electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) or electromagnetic quantum vacuum as
perceived from an accelerating reference frame. In such a frame, the Poynting
vector and momentum flux of the ZPF become non-zero. If one assumes that
scattering of the ZPF radiation takes place at the level of quarks and
electrons constituting matter, then it is possible for both Newton's equation
of motion, ${\bf f}=m{\bf a}$, and its relativistic covariant generalization,
${\cal F}=d{\cal P}/d\tau$, to be obtained as a consequence of the non-zero ZPF
momentum flux. We now conjecture that this scattering must take place at the
Compton frequency of a particle, and that this interpretation of mass leads
directly to the de Broglie relation characterizing the wave nature of that
particle in motion, $\lambda_B=h/p$. This suggests a perspective on a
connection between electrodynamics and the quantum wave nature of matter.
Attempts to extend this perspective to other aspects of the vacuum are left for
future consideration.

the different perspectives of four and five dimensions. The former applies to
light degrees of freedom below the threshold for five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein
excitations, whereas the five-dimensional perspective is also valid up to the
Calabi-Yau scale. We show how, in the latter case, two gauge sectors separated
in the fifth dimension are combined to form a consistent four-dimensional
supergravity. In the lowest order of the $\kappa^{2/3}$ expansion, we show how
a four-dimensional supergravity with gauge kinetic function $f_{1,2}=S$ is
reproduced, and we show how higher-order terms give rise to four-dimensional
operators that differ in the two gauge sectors. In the four-dimensional
approach, supersymmetry is seen to be broken when condensates form on one or
both walls, and the goldstino may have a non-zero dilatino component. As in the
five-dimensional approach, the Lagrangian is not a perfect square, and we have
not identified a vacuum with broken supersymmetry and zero vacuum energy. We
derive soft supersymmetry-breaking terms for non-standard perturbative
embeddings, that are relevant in more general situations such as type I/type
IIB orientifold models.

massive `fixed' scalar \nu in D=5 supergravity. While the value of <O_4 O_4

action of type IIB supergravity compactified on S^5 does not contain
\phi\phi\nu coupling and thus the corresponding correlator seems to vanish on
the AdS_5 side. This is in obvious contradiction with arguments suggesting
non-renormalization of 2- and 3-point functions of states from short multiplets
and implying agreement between the supergravity and SYM expressions for them.
We propose a natural resolution of this paradox which emphasizes the
10-dimensional nature of the correspondence. The basic idea is to treat the
constant mode of the dilaton as a part of the full S^5 Kaluza-Klein family of
dilaton modes. This leads to a non-zero result for the <O_4 O_4 O_8> correlator
on the supergravity side.

this M-theory expansion, I discuss several phenomenological issues:
universality of soft scalar masses, relations between the different scales of
the theory (eleven-dimensional Planck mass, compactification scale and orbifold
scale) in order to obtain unification at $3\times 10^{16}$ GeV or lower values,
soft supersymmetry-breaking terms, and finally charge and colour breaking
