statistically compare simulations with observations in order to constrain the
models. Here we characterize a suite of hydrodynamical and
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of supersonic turbulence using an
averaged wavelet transform, the Delta-variance, that has been successfully used
to characterize observations. We find that, independent of numerical resolution
and dissipation, the only models that produce scale-free, power-law
Delta-variance spectra are those with hypersonic Mach numbers above M ~ 4,
while slower supersonic turbulence tends to show characteristic scales and
produce non-power-law spectra. Magnetic fields have only a minor influence on
this tendency, though they tend to reduce the scale-free nature of the
turbulence, and increase the transfer of energy from large to small scales. The
evolution of the characteristic length scale seen in supersonic turbulence
follows exactly the t^{1/2} power-law predicted from recent studies of the
kinetic energy decay rate.

elliptical galaxy in the cooling flow cluster Abell 2597, using data obtained
with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST). This object is one of the archetypal ""blue-lobed"" cooling flow
radio elliptical galaxies, also displaying a luminous emission-line nebula, a
compact radio source, and a significant dust lane and evidence of molecular gas
in its center. We show that the radio source is surrounded by a complex network
of emission-line filaments, some of which display a close spatial association
with the outer boundary of the radio lobes. We present a detailed analysis of
the physical properties of ionized and neutral gas associated with the radio
lobes, and show that their properties are strongly suggestive of direct
interactions between the radio plasma and ambient gas. We resolve the blue
continuum emission into a series of knots and clumps, and present evidence that
these are most likely due to regions of recent star formation. We investigate
several possible triggering mechanisms for the star formation, including direct
interactions with the radio source, filaments condensing from the cooling flow,
or the result of an interaction with a gas-rich galaxy, which may also have
been responsible for fueling the active nucleus. We propose that the properties
of the source are plausibly explained in terms of accretion of gas by the cD
during an interaction with a gas-rich galaxy, which combined with the fact that
this object is located at the center of a dense, high-pressure ICM can account
for the high rates of star formation and the strong confinement of the radio
source.

similar to splitting at the ends of previously studied NTF's. With resolutions
as fine as 2'', the 3.6 and 6 cm images reveal a high degree of continuity and
little substructure internal to the filament. The spectral index of the
Northern Thread has been determined over a broad range of frequencies. Its flux
density falls with frequency, alpha=-0.5 between 90 and 6 cm, and becomes much
steeper (alpha=-2.0) between 6 and 2 cm. The spectral index does not vary
significantly along the length of the Northern Thread, which implies either
that the diffusion timescale for the emitting electrons is less than their
synchrotron lifetime, or that the emitting electrons are reaccelerated
continuously at multiple positions along the filament. Because of the lack of
spectral index variation, we have not located the source of relativistic
electrons. Polarization observations at 6 and 3.6 cm confirm the non-thermal
nature of the emission from the Northern Thread. The fractional polarization in
the Northern Thread reaches 70% in some regions, although the polarized
emission is patchy. Large rotation measures (RM > 2000 rad/m2) have been
observed with irregular variations across the filament.The intrinsic magnetic
field in the Northern Thread is predominantly aligned along its long axis.

each galaxy the light contribution of their bulges and discs.
  In order to investigate the differences between the velocity fields of the
sample galaxies we adopted the self-consistent dynamical model by Pignatelli &
Galletta (1999), which takes into account the asymmetric drift effects, the
projection effects along the line-of-sight and the non-Gaussian shape of the
line profiles due to the presence of different components with distinct
dynamical behavior. We find for the stellar component a sizeable asymmetric
drift effect in the inner regions of all the sample galaxies, as it results by
comparing their stellar rotation curves with the circular velocity predicted by
the models.
  The galaxy sample is not wide enough to draw general conclusions. However, we
have found a possible correlation between the presence of slowly-rising gas
rotation curves and the ratio of the bulge/disc half luminosity radii, while
there is no obvious correlation with the key parameter represented by the
morphological classification, namely the bulge/disc luminosity ratio. Systems
with a diffuse dynamically hot component (bulge or lens) with a scale length
comparable to that of the disc are characterized by slowly-rising gas rotation
curves. On the other hand, in systems with a small bulge the gas follows almost
circular motions, regardless of the luminosity of the bulge itself.

of construction history on the static stress distribution. The stresses beneath
the piles are monitored using a very sensitive capacitive technique. The piles
are formed either by release of granular material from a relatively small
output (localized source), or from a large diameter sieve (homogeneous rain).
The stress profiles resulting from localized source inputs have a clear stress
dip near the center of the pile while the results from an homogeneous rain show
no stress dip. We also show that the stress profiles scale simply with the pile
height. Experiments on wedges-shaped piles show the same effects but to a

features of an energy density: they are positive definite and satisfy the

whose spatial part is manifestly self-adjoint. In contrast to metric
formulations, the curvature-based approach to gravitational perturbation theory
generalizes in a natural way to self-gravitating matter fields. For a certain
relevant subspace of perturbations the pulsation operator is symmetric with
respect to a positive inner product and therefore allows spectral theory to be
applied. In particular, this is the case for odd-parity perturbations of

black holes, then restricting the observables to the Killing horizon together
with ""modular covariance"" for the Killing flow yields a conformally covariant
quantum field theory on the circle and a conformal spin-statistics theorem for

has a rotation and PT symmetry like the Schwarzschild-Kruskal black holes,
""geometric modular action"" of the rotational symmetry leads to a
spin-statistics theorem for charged covariant sectors where the spin is defined
via the SU(2)-covering of the spatial rotation group SO(3).

carried out using Sontag's universal control law to obtain an asymptotically

explain sonoluminescence, the emission of visible radiation. As the bubble
radius oscillates, shock waves develop from spherical sound waves created

strengthens and, upon convergence and subsequent reflection, temperature of gas
inside bubble increases dramatically in such a way that it can produce plasma.
Since main radiation product in exploding epoch, nonadiabatic condition for
imploding shock wave cool plasma and cause exploding shock wave can not
sufficiently rise temperature to produce radiation. In this work we compare
cooling time for plasma by bermsstrahlung radiation with collapsing time for
the imploding shock wave . We find a constraint on radius of bubble with

current density on the detector. This density is calculated from the solution

current density is not the usual Schr\""odinger current density. We define the
probability distribution of the time of arrival to a detector in terms of the
absorption current density. We define coordinate measurement by an absorbing
wall in terms of 4 postulates. We postulate, among others, that a quantum
particle has a trajectory. In the resulting theory the quantum mechanical
collapse of the wave function is replaced with the usual collapse of the
probability distribution after observation. Two examples are presented, that of
the slit experiment and the slit experiment with absorbing boundaries to
measure time of arrival. A calculation is given of the two dimensional
