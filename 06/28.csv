Beaming of the gamma radiation may overcome the energy puzzle. However any mild

3-8 Myr, star formation has been occurring along the tidal bridge and the tidal

4.4(+-1.2)E11 M_sun, inside the central 12 kpc (H_0=75 km/s/Mpc). The HI

radio to submillimetre-wave flux densities provides a redshift indicator for
dusty star-forming galaxies, when compared with the tight correlation between
the far-infrared and radio flux densities observed in low-redshift galaxies.
This method does provide a useful, albeit imprecise, indication of the distance

unequivocal redshift estimate, as the degeneracy between the effects of
increasing the redshift of a galaxy and decreasing its dust temperature is not

allows us for the first time to search for spectral breaks as so often observed
for normal pulsars around 1 GHz. We align the observed millisecond pulsar
profiles with data from lower frequencies. Deviations from a dipolar magnetic
field structure are not evident and absolute timing across the wide frequency
range with a single dispersion measure is possible. We seem to observe mainly
unfilled emission beams, which must originate from a very compact region. A
compact emission region is also suggested by a remarkably constant profile
width or component separation over a very wide frequency range. For a few
sources, polarization data at 2.7 and 4.9 GHz could also be obtained which
indicate that millisecond pulsars are weakly polarized or even unpolarized at
frequencies above 3 GHz. The simultaneous decrease in degree of polarization
and the constant profile width thus question proposals which link
de-polarization and decreasing profile width for normal pulsars to the same
propagation effect (i.e. birefringence). Comparing the properties of core and
conal like profile components to those of normal pulsars, we find less
significant patterns in their spectral evolution for the population of
millisecond pulsars. Hence, we suggest that core and conal emission may be
created by the same emission process. In general, MSP emission properties tend
to resemble those of normal pulsars only shifted towards higher frequencies.

known ``narrow-line'' Seyfert 1 in the 2-10 keV band. The measured X-ray
spectrum is dominated by a steep (Gamma~2.7) power-law continuum extending to
at least 20 keV, with imprinted Fe K-line and -edge features and an additional
``soft excess'' below ~1.5 keV. The energy of the iron K-edge indicates the
presence of highly ionised material, which we identify in terms of reflection
from a strongly irradiated accretion disc. The high reflectivity of this
putative disc, together with its strong intrinsic O VIII Ly-alpha and O VIII
recombination emission, can also explain much of the observed soft excess flux.
Furthermore, the same spectral model also provides a reasonable match to the
very steep 0.1-2 keV spectrum deduced from ROSAT data. The source is much more
rapidly variable than ``normal'' Seyfert 1s of comparable luminosity,
increasing by a factor of ~50% in 1.6 hours, with no measurable lag between the
0.5-2 keV and 3-12 keV bands, consistent with much of the soft excess flux
arising from reprocessing of the primary power-law component in the inner
region of the accretion disc. We note, finally, that if the unusually steep
power-law component is a result of Compton cooling of a disc corona by an
intense soft photon flux, then the implication is that the bulk of these soft
photons lie in the unobserved extreme ultraviolet.

the degree of the local freezing is rather small even at temperatures where the
field-cooled permittivity exceeds the frequency dependent permittivity by an
order of magnitude. This observation indicates the significant role of the
critical slowing down (accompanying the glass freezing) in the system dynamics.
Also the theory predicts an important interrelationship between the frequency

transition in the semi-infinite Hubbard model at half-filling and zero

simple-cubic lattice and systematically vary the model parameters at the very
surface. Within the DMFT the problem is self-consistently mapped onto a set of
coupled effective impurity models corresponding to the inequivalent layers
parallel to the surface. Assuming that the influence of the Hubbard bands on
the low-energy quasi-particle resonance can be neglected at the critical point,
a simplified ``linearized DMFT'' becomes possible which is formally equivalent
to the Weiss molecular-field theory for the semi-infinite Ising model. This
implies that qualitatively the rich phenomenology of the Landau description of
second-order phase transitions at surfaces has a direct analogue for the
surface Mott transition. Motivated by this formal analogy, we work out the
predictions of the linearized DMFT in detail. It is found that under certain
circumstances the surface of a Mott insulator can be metallic while a
Mott-insulating surface of a normal metal is not possible. The corresponding
phase diagrams, the (mean-field) critical exponents and the critical profiles
of the quasi-particle weight are derived. The results are confirmed by a fully

\bar{u}\Gamma u + \bar{d}\Gamma d + \bar{s}\Gamma s$ contribute to many
important physical observables in the low energy region of QCD. Experimentally
one finds the values of some of these observables to be in sharp contrast to
the naive (perturbative) theoretical expectations. This indicates that non
perturbative vacuum properties might play a major role in the comprehension of
these phenomena. An example of such a vacuum contribution is the axial anomaly,
which appears in the divergence of the flavor singlet axial current and which
is connected to the topological properties of QCD. From a field theoretical
point of view flavor singlet matrix elements differ from non singlet amplitudes
in the occurrence of so called disconnected insertions. These are correlations
of hadron propagators with quark-antiquark loops or correlations between
quark-antiquark loops, which are mediated by vacuum fluctuations. According to
their respective flavor composition, the disconnected insertions cancel largely
in non singlet processes, but add in flavor singlet amplitudes. The lattice
approach provides an ideal tool to study flavor singlet phenomena. Being a
first principle method it should be capable to uncover non perturbative vacuum
contributions and to yield, on the long run, reliable results for the size of
such contributions in QCD. The present article reviews the status of flavor
singlet matrix element calculations in lattice QCD with respect to methods,
results and reliability. Special emphasis is paid to the discussion of state of
the art calculations of the pion nucleon sigma term $\sigma_{\pi N}$, the
flavor singlet axial coupling of the proton $G_A^1$, and the $\eta'$ mass.

  Published by the Univ. Autonoma de Barcelona ISBN 84-490-1544-8",,,,"hep-ph",,"  In this Thesis we have investigated some effects appearing in top quark
observables in the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model
(MSSM). We have computed the radiative corrections to some top quark
observables, using the on-shell renormalization scheme, and with a physically
motivated definition of the tan(beta) parameter. Introductory chapters deal
with the MSSM, its renormalization, and the on-shell prescription. In the next
chapters we have computed the SUSY-EW corrections (and some SUSY-QCD
corrections) to: the non-standard top quark decay partial width \Gamma(t->H+
b); the FCNC top quark decay width \Gamma(t-> c h) (h=h^0,H^0,A^0); and the
non-standard top quark production through sbottom decays \Gamma(sbottom -> t
\chi^-). We have investigated the consequences of the corrections to
\Gamma(t->H^+ b) in the interpretation of the present Tevatron data. Our
general conclusion is that the supersymmetric strong and electroweak radiative
corrections can be very important in the top/bottom-Higgs super-sector of the
MSSM. Therefore, it is necessary to account for these corrections in the
theoretical computation of the high energy physics observables, otherwise
highly significant information on the potentially underlying SUSY dynamics
could be missed. This is true, not only for the future experiments at the LHC
and the LC, but also for the present Run I data (and the Run II data around the
corner) at the Fermilab Tevatron collider.

this problem by adding cosmological constants to the brane and the bulk, as in

Lagrangian submanifold can be identified with the phase space of the BFV

BFV Poisson bracket is induced by a natural even Poisson bracket on the
stationary surface of the master action, while the BRST charge originates from
the BV gauge-fixed BRST transformation defined on a gauge-fixing surface. The
inverse construction allows one to arrive at the BV formulation of the

an intriguing geometrical interpretation of the nonminimal variables and

light diffracted by a periodic grating and to the quantum rotator. A simple
connection between the waves and the Wigner function of the initial state of
the particle is demonstrated, and some results for more general potentials are
given.

which are sometimes called `environmentally induced' or `soft'. A natural
question is whether such dynamical processes are eventually also responsible
for at least some of the superselection rules which are usually presented as
fundamentally rooted in the kinematical structure of the theory (so called
`hard' superselection rules). With this question in mind, I re-investigate two
well known examples where superselection rules are usually argued to rigorously
exist within the given mathematical framework. These are (1) the Bargmann
superselection rule for the total mass in Galilei invariant quantum mechanics
and (2) the charge superselection rule in quantum electrodynamics. I argue
that, for various reasons, the kinematical arguments usually given are not
physically convincing unless they are based on an underlying dynamical process.

distribution function for the eigenvalues of ensembles of random matrices with
orthogonal or symplectic symmetry. In particular, the distribution functions
are completely determined by a certain sum involving the skew orthogonal
polynomials. In the cases that the eigenvalue probability density function
involves a classical weight function, explicit formulas for the skew orthogonal
polynomials are given in terms of related orthogonal polynomials, and the
structure is used to give a closed form expression for the sum. This theory
treates all classical cases on an equal footing, giving formulas applicable at
once to the Hermite, Laguerre and Jacobi cases.

nonlinear Schrodinger equation, describing thrid order dispersion, Kerr effect
and stimulated Raman scattering. These new solutions have been obtaiened by
invoking a group of nonlinear transformations acting on localised stable
solutions. Stability of these solutions has been studied for different values
of the arbitrary coefficients, involved in the recursion relation and
consequently, different values of coefficient lead to different transmission
rates for almost same input power. Another series solution containing even
powers of localised stable solution is shown to exist for higher order
nonlinear Schrodinger equation.
