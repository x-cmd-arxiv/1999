of light in random media, to determine the distance upto which photons travel
along almost undeviated paths within a scattering medium, and are therefore

Such photons are isolated by polarisation discrimination wherein the plane of
linear polarisation of the input light is continuously rotated and the
polarisation preserving component of the emerging light is extracted by means
of a Fourier transform. This technique is a software implementation of lock-in
detection. We find that images may be recovered to a depth far in excess of
what is predicted by the diffusion theory of photon propagation. To understand
our experimental results, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to model the
random walk behaviour of the multiply scattered photons. We present a new
definition of a diffusing photon in terms of the memory of its initial
direction of propagation, which we then quantify in terms of an angular
correlation function. This redefinition yields the penetration depth of the
polarisation preserving photons. Based on these results, we have formulated a

flat-band regime. The experimental data are presented for an MBE-grown DQW
consisting of two 5 nm wide GaAs wells, separated by a 4 monolayers (MLs) wide
pure AlAs central barrier, and sandwiched between Ga_{0.7}Al_{0.3}As layers.
The bias voltage is applied along the growth direction. Spatially direct and
indirect excitonic transitions are identified, and the radius of the exciton
and squeezing of the exciton in the growth direction are evaluated
variationally. The excitonic binding energies, recombination energies,
oscillator strengths, and relative intensities of the transitions as functions
of the applied field are calculated. Our analysis demonstrates that this simple
model is applicable in case of narrow DQWs not just for a qualitative
description of the PL peak positions but also for the estimation of their
individual shapes and intensities.

broad bands, small pi-type p-d overlap causes a narrow peak at E_F. Without the

calculations reveal an antiferromagnetic ground state and ferromagnetic order
at slightly higher energy. Since direct d-d exchange interaction plays only a
minor role, ordering of the localized vanadium moments can be attributed

suppressed by the geometric frustration, the remaining spin fluctuations
suggest an explanation of the low temperature behaviour of the specific heat.

Ilinski et al.) considers fluctuations around this equilibrium state by
introducing a relaxational dynamics with random noise for intermediate
deviations called ``virtual'' arbitrage returns. In this work, the model is
incorporated within a martingale pricing method for derivatives on securities
(e.g. stocks) in incomplete markets using a mapping to option pricing theory
with stochastic interest rates. Using a famous result by Merton and with some
help from the path integral method, exact pricing formulas for European call

intermediate deviations from economic equilibrium) are derived where only the
final integration over initial arbitrage returns needs to be performed
numerically. This result is complemented by a discussion of the hedging
strategy associated to a derivative, which replicates the final payoff but
turns out to be not self-financing in the real world, but self-financing {\it
when summed over the derivative's remaining life time}. Numerical examples are
given which underline the fact that an additional positive risk premium (with
respect to the Black-Scholes values) is found reflecting extra hedging costs
due to intermediate deviations from economic equilibrium.

real algebraic geometry and the main result is a congruence generalising
Arnol'd, Rokhlin, Mishachev, Zvonilov and Mikhalkin 's previous results. This
congruence is obtained with a canonical map defined on homology groups of
dimension half the dimension of the manifold with coefficients in $Z/lZ$, with
values in $Z/2lZ$.

solvable lattice models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester and the string
functions associated with admissible representations of the affine Lie algebra
A$_1^{(1)}$ as introduced by Kac and Wakimoto can be exploited to yield a very
general class of conjugate Bailey pairs. Using the recently established
fermionic or constant-sign expressions for the one-dimensional configuration

fractional-level string functions, parafermion characters and A$_1^{(1)}$
branching functions. In addition, $q$-series identities are obtained whose Lie
algebraic and/or combinatorial interpretation is still lacking.

surprising result that the induced pseudoscalar coupling constant $g_P$ was
larger than the value obtained from $\mu^- p \to n \nu_{\mu}$ experiment as
much as 44 %. Reexamining axial vector current on the gauge theory, we found an
additional term to the matrix element of Beder and Fearing which was used to
extract the $g_P$ value from the measured photon energy spectrum. This
additional term, which is self gauge invariant, plays a key role in restoring
the reliability of $g_P (- 0.88 m_{\mu}^2) = 6.77 g_A (0)$. Comparison with
conventional approaches is also presented.

particle are expressed in terms of the elements of a complex Clifford algebra
which combines the complex properties of SL(2.C) and quantum mechanics. When
the quantum measurement principle is adapted to the generating space of the
Clifford algebra we find that the transition probabilities for twofold
degenerate paths in space-time equals the transition amplitudes for the
underlying paths in Clifford space. This property is used to show that the
apparent non-locality of quantum mechanics in a double slit experiment and in
an EPR type of measurement is resolved when analyzed in terms of the full paths
in the underlying Clifford space. We comment on the relationship of this model
to the time symmetric formulation of quantum mechanics and to the
Wheeler-Feynman model.
