field of CL1358+62 at z=0.33 are used to study the Fundamental Plane of

constructed the Fundamental Plane for the 30 E and S0 galaxies and find that it
has the following shape: r_e = sigma**(1.31+-0.13) * <I>_e**(-0.86+-0.10),
similar to that found locally. The 1-sigma intrinsic scatter about this plane
is 14% in M/L(V), comparable to that observed in Coma. We conclude that these E
and S0 galaxies are structurally mature and homogeneous, like those observed in
nearby clusters. The M/L(V) ratios of these early-type galaxies are offset from
the Coma Fundamental Plane by delta log M/L(V) = -0.13+- 0.03 (q0=0.1),
indicative of mild luminosity evolution. This evolution suggests a formation
epoch for the stars of z > 1. We have also analyzed the M/L(V) ratios of
galaxies of type S0/a and later. These early-type spirals follow a different
plane from the E and S0 galaxies, with a scatter that is twice as large as the
scatter for the E/S0s. The difference in the tilt between the plane of the
spirals and the plane of the E/S0s is shown to be due to a systematic
correlation of velocity dispersion with residual from the plane of the
early-type galaxies. These residuals also correlate with the residuals from the
Color-Magnitude relation. Thus for spirals in clusters, we see a systematic
variation in the luminosity-weighted mean properties of the stellar populations
with central velocity dispersion. If this is a relative age trend, then
luminosity-weighted age is positively correlated with dispersion. [abridged

abundance can be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity in the universe.
We carry out a maximum likelihood analysis incorporating a number of current

the assumption of Gaussianity, the current data prefer a universe with matter
density $\Omega_m\simeq 0.3$ and are inconsistent with $\Omega_m=1$ at the
$2\sigma$ level. If we assume $\Omega_m=1$, the predicted degree of cluster
evolution is consistent with the data for non-Gaussian models where the
primordial fluctuations have at least two times as many peaks of height
$3\sigma$ or more as a Gaussian distribution does. These results are robust to
almost all sources of systematic error considered: in particular, the
$\Omega_m=1$ Gaussian case can only be reconciled with the data if a number of
systematic effects conspire to modify the analysis in the right direction.
Given an independent measurement of $\Omega_m$, the techniques described here
represent a powerful tool with which to constrain non-Gaussianity in the
primordial universe, independent of specific details of the non-Gaussian
physics. We discuss the prospects and strategies for improving the constraints

centroid of the source star image is displaced relative to the position of the
unlensed source star with an elliptical trajectory. Recently, routine
astrometric follow-up measurements of these source star image centroid shifts
by using high precision interferometers are proposed to measure the lens proper
motion which can resolve the lens parameter degeneracy in the photometrically
determined Einstein time scale. When an event is caused by a bright lens, on
the other hand, the astrometric shift is affected by the light from the lens,
but one cannot identify the existence of the bright lens from the observed
trajectory because the resulting trajectory of the bright lens event is also an
ellipse. As results, lensing parameters determined from the trajectory differ
from those of a dark lens event, causing wrong identification of lens
population. In this paper, we show that although the shape and size of the
astrometric centroid shift trajectory are changed due to the bright lens, the
angular speed of centroid shifts around the apparent position of the unlensed
source star is not affected by the lens brightness. Then, one can identify the
existence of the bright lens and determine its brightness by comparing the lens
parameters determined from the angular speed curve with those determined from
the trajectory of observed centroid shifts. Once the lens brightness is
determined, one can correct for the lens proper motion. Since the proposed
method provides both information about the lens brightness (dark or bright) and
the corrected values of the physical parameters of the lens, one can
significantly better constrain the nature of MACHOs.

properties such as mass, temperature and X-ray luminosity, and radial profiles

agreement among the various simulations is gratifying although a number of
discrepancies exist. Agreement is best for properties of the dark matter and
worst for the total X-ray luminosity. Even in this case, simulations that
adequately resolve the core radius of the gas distribution predict total X-ray
luminosities that agree to within a factor of two. Other quantities are
reproduced to much higher accuracy. For example, the temperature and gas mass
fraction within the virial radius agree to about 10%, and the ratio of specific

M31 in the energy band from 0.1 to 10 keV. We find that the globular cluster
sources have spectral characteristics consistent with those of the Milky Way
object, namely that the spectrum can be described by a thermal model with 6-20
keV from 2 to 10 keV. Evidence of high absorption in some of these sources is
most likely an indication that they lie in or behind the HI ring in the disk of
the galaxy.
  We also find one peculiar globular cluster source, with spectral
characteristics more typically associated with either High Mass X-ray Binaries
or black hole candidates. We therefore suggest that either the source has been
wrongly identified with a globular cluster or that the system contains a Black
Hole. We confirm earlier report that the spectrum of the bulge of M31 is
consistent with the superposition of many LMXB spectra. It is likely that a
large fraction of the 15-30 keV detection obtained from the PDS instrument is
associated with the bulge, thus extending the spectral data for this complex of
sources up to 30 keV. The high energy part of the spectrum can be parameterized
with typical LMXB spectra, while at low energies an additional component is
required.

use a minimal model to describe the ordered phase at T=0. The on-site Coulomb
repulsion $U$ is set to infinity. There are two electronic orbitals and three
oxygen vibrational coordinates per unit cell. In addition to spin excitations
and phonons, the model has electronic excitations consisting of mis-orienting

displacements are coupled, this excitation becomes a self-trapped exciton with
energy $\Delta$, half the JT gap. Adding dynamic oxygen displacements in
one-phonon approximation introduces dispersion to both the (previously
Einstein-like) phonons and the orbital excitons (``orbitons''). One of the
phonon branches has zero frequency at $\vec{k}=(0,0,\pi)$. This is the

to the differential quadrature (DQ) solution of geometrically nonlinear bending
of isotropic and orthotropic rectangular plates. By using the Hadamard product,
the nonlinear formulations are greatly simplified, while the SJT product
approach minimizes the effort to evaluate the Jacobian derivative matrix in the
Newton-Raphson method for solving the resultant nonlinear formulations. In
addition, the coupled nonlinear formulations for the present problems can
easily be decoupled by means of the Hadamard and SJT product. Therefore, the
size of the simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations is reduced by two-thirds
and the computing effort and storage requirements are alleviated greatly. Two
recent approaches applying the multiple boundary conditions are employed in the
present DQ nonlinear computations. The solution accuracies are improved
obviously in comparison to the previously given by Bert et al. The numerical
results and detailed solution procedures are provided to demonstrate the superb

thermalized fermions to one loop. We investigate various temperature domains
and also include a background magnetic field. While low-temperature effects to
one loop are exponentially damped by the electron mass, there exists a maximum
velocity shift of $-\delta v^2_{max}=\alpha/(3\pi)$ in the
intermediate-temperature domain $T\sim m$.

principal nilpotent pair in a semisimple Lie algebra \g. Our aim is to
contribute to the general theory of nilpotent pairs. Roughly speaking, a
nilpotent pair (e_1,e_2) consists of two commuting elements in \g that can
independently be contracted to the origin. A principal nilpotent pair is a
double counterpart of a regular nilpotent element. Consequently, the theory of
nilpotent pairs should stand out as double counterpart of the theory of
nilpotent orbits. We show that any nilpotent pair has a characteristic
(h_1,h_2), which is unique within to conjugacy. Generalizing Dynkin's approach
to (sl_2)-triples, we prove that the number of G-orbits of characteristics of
nilpotent pairs is finite and provide some estimates for the numerical labels
\alpha_j(h_i), where {\alpha_j} are suitable simple roots of \g. It was
observed by Ginzburg that the number of G-orbits of nilpotent pairs is
infinite. This means this class is too wide to have a reasonable theory. To
resolve this difficulty, we introduce `wonderful' nilpotent pairs. We prove
that if two wonderful pairs have the same characteristic, then these are
conjugate. This implies that there are finitely many G-orbits of wonderful
pairs. A number of nice properties of wonderful pairs shows that these can be
regarded as right double analogue of nilpotent orbits. We also consider several
natural classes of wonderful pairs and describe characteristics for principal
and almost principal nilpotent pairs.

inter-cluster interactions has been investigated. For this, we first address
the question of how to obtain the analytical properties of the Jost function in
regions of physical interest on the complex k-plane when the potential is given
in a tabular form. We then employ the Marchenko inverse scattering method to
construct, numerically, phase equivalent local potentials supporting the same
bound state(s) but having different resonance spectra which affect the
off-shell characteristics of the corresponding scattering amplitudes. This
implies that the inclusion of the experimental resonances in constructing a
potential would change its shape, strength, and range which in turn would
modify the bound and scattering wave functions in the interior region. This is
expected to have important consequences in calculations of transition
amplitudes in nuclear reaction theories, which strongly depend on the behaviour
of the wave functions at short distances. The influence of Supersymmetric
Transformations on the position and movement of resonances has also been
investigated.

The result is a continuous function of the deformation parameter (eccentricity)

and possesses the correct limit of the circular billiard at zero eccentricity.
Away from the circular limit and the bifurcations, it reduces to the usual
(extended) Gutzwiller trace formula which for the leading-order families of
periodic orbits is identical to the result of Berry and Tabor. We show that the
circular disk limit of the diameter-orbit contribution is also reached through
contributions from closed (periodic and non-periodic) orbits of hyperbolic type
with an even number of reflections from the boundary. We obtain the Maslov

for transport is characterized by the scaling exponent $q$ and the Hurst
exponent $H$, as functions of the parameters. The parameter space is divided
into regimes of scaling laws of different {\em functional forms} of the scaling
exponent and the Hurst exponent. We present the full three-dimensional phase
diagram.
  The limiting process is one of three kinds: Brownian motion ($H=1/2$),
persistent fractional Brownian motions ($1/2<H<1$) and regular (or smooth)
motion (H=1).
  We discover that a critical wave number divides the infrared cutoffs into
three categories, critical, subcritical and supercritical; they give rise to
different scaling laws and phase diagrams. We introduce the notions of sampling
drift and eddy diffusivity, and formulate variational principles to estimate
the eddy diffusivity. We show that fractional Brownian motions result from a

its ground state. Perturbations of the turbulence model physical fields.
Particles originate from the voids in the fluid. Symmetrical pairs of
particle-antiparticle find analogies in mechanical pairs of
cyclone-anticyclone. A quantum particle is modeled by the dispersion of a point
discontinuity (defect) in the stochastic medium. Gravitation relates to
emitting by defects the continual flow of the transient point dilatation. The
