probably the result of turbulence. Such structure opens up the disk to the
transmission of OB star light into the halo, and it provides for a diffuse
ionized component that tapers away gradually from each dense HII region.
Fractal cloud structure may also produce the cloud and clump mass functions,
and perhaps even the star cluster mass function.

  Series, San Francisco, 1999",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Observations of the stellar initial mass function are reviewed. The
flattening at low mass is evidence for a characteristic mass in star formation,
which could be the minimum stellar mass for the onset of deuterium burning or
the thermal Jeans mass. Variations in the mass of the flattened part are
important for understanding star formation; e.g., starburst galaxies may be an
example where the characteristic mass is larger than it is locally. A steeper
high-mass slope in the extreme field studied by Massey et al. may be the result
of cloud destruction and the termination of star formation by ionization, with
a normal IMF in each separate cluster. The lack of a density dependence in
cluster IMFs suggests that star and protostar interactions play little role in
star formation or the IMF. These considerations, along with indirect
observations of the IMF in the early Universe, suggest that the IMF does not
vary much in its basic form over position and time, but that shifts in the
characteristic mass might occur in regions with extremely high or low star
formation activity.

stellar masses are randomly sampled down to the thermal Jeans mass from
hierarchically structured pre-stellar clouds, predicts that regions of
ultra-cold CO gas, such as those recently found in nearby galaxies by Allen and
collaborators, should make an abundance of Brown Dwarfs with relatively few
normal stars. This result comes from the low value of the thermal Jeans mass,
considering that the hierarchical cloud model always gives the Salpeter IMF
slope above this lower mass limit. The ultracold CO clouds in the inner disk of
M31 have T~3K and pressures that are probably 10 times higher than in the solar
neighborhood. This gives a mass at the peak of the IMF equal to 0.01 Msun, well
below the Brown Dwarf limit of 0.08 Msun. Using a functional approximation to
the IMF, the ultracold clouds would have 50% of the star-like mass and 90% of
the objects below the Brown Dwarf limit. The brightest of the Brown Dwarfs in
M31 should have an apparent, extinction-corrected K-band magnitude of ~21 mag
in their pre-main sequence phase.

Combining SN 1998bu with three other well-observed local calibrators and 42

the bridging effect resulting from the deviations of the local conductivity
near the selected cell from the average effective media conductivity. The most
important feature of the proposed model is the existence of the ``jamming''

tissue breakage. The different transitions corresponding to the ``jamming''

transition to this future inflationary phase of cosmological expansion will
preclude indefinite survival of intelligent species in our domain, because of
the rapid shrinking of particle horizons and subsequent depletion of energy
necessary for information processes within the horizon of any observer.
Therefore, to satisfy the Final Anthropic Hypothesis (reformulated to apply to

inflation of Linde (or some similar model) provides a satisfactory description
of reality, (ii) migration between causally connected domains within the

3He(e,e'p) including the radiation tail originating from bremsstrahlung
processes. This calculation is compared to measured cross sections. The
calculation is carried out from within a Monte Carlo simulation program so that
acceptance-averaging effects, along with a subset of possible energy losses,
are taken into account. Excellent agreement is obtained between our calculation
and measured data, after a correction factor for higher-order bremsstrahlung is
devised and applied to the tail. Industry-standard radiative corrections fail
miserably for these data, and we use the results of our calculation to dissect
the failure. Implications for design and analysis of experiments in the
Jefferson-Lab energy domain are discussed.

and the HBT radius parameters in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions is
investigated. We show that the HBT radius parameters in general do not reflect
the R.M.S. deviations of the single particle production points. Instead, the
HBT radius parameters are most closely related to the curvature of the
two-particle space-time relative position distribution at the origin. We
support our arguments by studies with a dynamical model (RQMD 2.4).

effectively describe, for relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the empirically
observed deviation from unity of the intercept \lambda (i.e. the measured value
corresponding to zero relative momentum {\bf p} of two registered identical
pions or kaons) of the two-particle correlation function C(p,K). The approach
is based on the use of two versions of the so-called q-deformed oscillators and
the corresponding picture of ideal gases of q-bosons. By these techniques the
intercept \lambda is put into direct correspondence with the deformation
parameter q. For fixed deformation strength, the model predicts dependence of
the intercept \lambda on the pion pair mean momentum {\bf K}.
