during preheating stage in a two field model with the potential $V(\phi, \chi)=
{m^{2}\phi^{2}\over 2}+{g^{2}\phi^{2}\chi^{2}\over 2}$. We discuss two possible
sources of such perturbations: a) due to the coupling between the perturbation
of the matter field $\delta \chi$ and the background part of the matter field
$\chi_{0}(t)$, b) due to non-linear fluctuations in a condensate of
``particles'' of the field $\chi$. Both types of the metric perturbations are
assumed to be small, and estimated using the linear theory of the metric
perturbations. We estimate analytically the upper limit of the amplitude of the
metric perturbations for all scales in the limit of so-called broad resonance,
and show that the large scale metric perturbations are very small, and taking
them into account does not influence the standard picture of the production of
the metric perturbations in inflationary scenario.

XMM, it is possible to devise a measurement of the absolute density of heavy
elements in the hypothetical warm gas filling intercluster space. This gas may
be the largest reservoir of baryonic matter in the Universe, but even its
existence has not been proven observationally at low redshifts. The proposed
measurement would make use of a unique filament of galaxy clusters spanning
over 700 Mpc (0.1<z<0.2) along the line of sight in a small area of the sky in
Aquarius. The surface density of Abell clusters there is more than 6 times the
sky average. It is likely that the intercluster matter column density is
enhanced by a similar factor, making its detection feasible under certain
optimistic assumptions about its density and elemental abundances. One can
compare photoabsorption depth, mostly in the partially ionized oxygen edges, in
the spectra of clusters at different distances along the filament, looking for
a systematic increase of depth with the distance. The absorption can be
measured by the same detector and through the same Galactic column, hence the
differential test. A CCD moderate energy resolution (about 100 eV) is adequate
for detecting an absorption edge at a known redshift.

of this survey is its photometric accuracy, ~ 0.02 V mag, achieved through
differential photometry with CCD detectors, what allows the detection of faint
levels of variability. We find that the relative variability, delta = sigma /
L, observed in the V band is anti-correlated with both luminosity and redshift,
although we have no means of discovering the dominant relation, given the
strong coupling between luminosity and redshift for the objects in our
sample.We introduce a model for the dependence of quasar variability on
frequency that is consistent with multi-wavelength observations of the nuclear
variability of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. We show that correcting the
observed variability for this effect slightly increases the significance of the
trends of variability with luminosity and redshift. Assuming that variability
depends only on the luminosity, we show that the corrected variability is
anti-correlated with luminosity and is in good agreement with predictions of a
simple Poissonian model. The energy derived for the hypothetical pulses, ~
10^50 erg, agrees well with those obtained in other studies. We also find that
the radio-loud objects in our sample tend to be more variable than the
radio-quiet ones, for all luminosities and redshifts.

can use PROGRAPE-1 to calculate not only gravitational interactions but also
other forms of interactions such as van der Waals force, hydrodynamical
interactions in SPH calculation and so on. PROGRAPE-1 comprises two Altera
EPF10K100 FPGA chips, each of which contains nominally 100,000 gates. To
evaluate the programmability and performance of PROGRAPE-1, we implemented a
pipeline for gravitational interaction similar to that of GRAPE-3. One pipeline
fitted into a single FPGA chip, which operated at 16 MHz clock. Thus, for
gravitational interaction, PROGRAPE-1 provided the speed of 0.96
Gflops-equivalent. PROGRAPE will prove to be useful for wide-range of
particle-based simulations in which the calculation cost of interactions other
than gravity is high, such as the evaluation of SPH interactions.

1994,1995; Wainscoat et al. 1992) with star counts taken from the Two Micron
Galactic plane Survey (TMGS: Garzon et al. 1993). Through these comparisons we
can examine discrepancies between counts and model and thereby elicit an
understanding of Galactic structure. Over the vast majority of areas in which
we have compared the TMGS data with SKY's predictions we find very good accord;
so good that we are able to remove the disc source counts to highlight
structure in the plane. The exponential disc is usually dominant, but by
relying on SKY's predicted disc counts we have been able to probe the molecular
ring, spiral arms, and parts of the bulge. The latter is clearly triaxial. We
recognize a number of off-plane dust clouds not readily included in models.
However, we find that, whilst the simple exponential extinction function works
well in the outer Galaxy, closer than about 4 kpc to the Centre the extinction
drops dramatically. We also examine the shape of the luminosity function of the
bulge and argue that the cores of all spiral arms we have observed contain a
significant population of supergiants that provides an excess of bright source
counts over those of a simple model of the arms. Analysis of one relatively
isolated cut through an arm near longitude 65 degrees categorically precludes
any possibility of a sech^2 z stellar density function for the disc.

when allowed to interact in the 3-brane, the untwisted field becomes unstable

submanifold results results from one-loop corrections that arise from coupling
with the twisted field. On the other hand, the twisted field can make the two
3-branes distinguishable by causing an energy difference between them. That is
due to the antiperiodicity of the twisted fields, when rotating with $\pi$ to
go from one 3-brane to the other. The energy difference between the branes

to the position of the test mass. The sloshing of the resulting signal between
the resonators, and a wise choice of where to place the resonators' output
waveguide, produce a signal in the waveguide that (for sufficiently low
frequencies) is proportional to the test-mass velocity (speed) rather than its
position. This permits the speed meter to achieve force-measurement
sensitivities better than the standard quantum limit (SQL), both when operating
in a narrow-band mode and a wide-band mode. A scrutiny of experimental issues
shows that it is feasible, with current technology, to construct a
demonstration speed meter that beats the wide-band SQL by a factor 2. A concept
is sketched for an adaptation of this speed meter to optical frequencies; this
adaptation forms the basis for a possible LIGO-III interferometer that could
beat the gravitational-wave standard quantum limit h_SQL, but perhaps only by a
factor 1/xi = h_SQL/h ~ 3 (constrained by losses in the optics) and at the
price of a very high circulating optical power --- larger by 1/xi^2 than that

considering $B \to D_s^+X_u$ versus the semileptonic decay is that more than 50
% of the spectrum for $B \to D_s^+ X_u$ occurs above the kinematical limit for
$B \to D_s^+ X_c$, while most of the spectrum $B \to l \nu X_u$ occurs below
the $B \to l \nu X_c$ one. Furthermore, the measure of the hadronic mass $M_X$
is easier in the presence of an identified $D_s$ than when a $\nu$ has been
produced. As a consistency check, we point out that the rate $\bar{b} \to
D_s^{(*)+} \bar{c}$ (including QCD corrections that we present elsewhere) is
consistent with the measured $BR (B \to D_s^{\pm} X)$. Although the hadronic
complications may be more severe in the mode that we propose than in the
semileptonic inclusive decay, the end of the spectrum in $B \to l \nu X_u$ is
not well understood on theoretical grounds. We argue that, in our case, the
excited $D_s^{**}$, decaying into $D K$, do not contribute and, if there is
tagging of the $B$ meson, the other mechanisms to produce a $D_s$ of the right
sign are presumably small, of $O(10^{-2})$ relative to the spectator amplitude,
or can be controlled by kinematical cuts. In the absence of tagging, other
hadronic backgrounds deserve careful study. We present a feasability study with

the AdS energy E is quantized in units of the AdS_5 radius R,

also argue that the mass operator will be identified with the moduli of the

The spectrum of physical states with vanishing ghost number contains a

investigate Wilson loops and compute the associated heavy quark-antiquark
potentials for the strongly coupled SU(N) super-Yang-Mills gauge theory, when
the gauge symmetry is broken by the expectation values of the scalar fields.
For the case of a uniform distribution of D3-branes over a disc, we find that
there exists a maximum separation beyond which there is no force between the
quark and the antiquark, i.e. the screening is complete. We associate this
phenomenon with the possible existence of a mass gap in the strongly coupled
gauge theory. In the finite-temperature case, when the corresponding
supergravity solution is a rotating D3-brane solution, there is a class of
potentials interpolating between a Coulombic and a confining behaviour.
However, above a certain critical value of the mass parameter, the potentials
exhibit a behaviour characteristic of statistical systems undergoing phase
transitions. The physical path preserves the concavity property of the
potential and minimizes the energy. Using the same rotating-brane solutions, we
also compute spatial Wilson loops, associated with the quark-antiquark
potential in models of three-dimensional gauge theories at zero temperature,
with similar results.

of $\alpha$ ($\simeq 1.2$) from unity may have its origin in the multiple
scattering suffered by the partons. We also find that the constant of
proportionality in the above scaling relation increases substantially in going
from SPS to RHIC energies. This would imply that the (semi)hard partonic
activity becomes a much cleaner signal above the soft particle production at
the higher energy of RHIC, and thus much less dependent on the (lack of)
