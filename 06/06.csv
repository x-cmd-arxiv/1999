  to Physica C",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con",,"  We report anomalous features in the normal-state resistivity of single
crystalline Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_8 whiskers near some characteristic temperature T*
\~ 250 K. From these varied oxygen-doping samples, the resistance (R) was found
to deviate {\it upward} from the linear-T relation for T< T*, while R keeps
decreasing with T. The deviation, $\Delta R \equiv R - (a + bT)$, reaches a
maximum in a temperature range of ~ 25 K just before R-T follows the well-known
descent associated with the pseudogap opening in the underdoped samples. A
second kink was also found in some samples immediately following the first one,
resulting in an S-shaped feature in the R-T curve. The resistance then resumes
nearly linear-T decrease below the anomalies in contrast to the first case. We
interpret these features as being related to crystal structure transformation
(or lattice distortion), as was evidenced in thermal and elastic property
measurements. These structural instabilities seem to be connected to the
subsequent dynamics as T is further lowered.

approach is based on the concept of scattering states for a time dependent
Hamiltonian neglecting electron-electron interaction. Using this approach we
calculated the spectra of the current noise in a biased point contact
irradiated by a weak random field. For typical radiation frequencies \nu less

  variant finite differencing scheme, and discuss problems with noise addition;
  now submitted to Physical Review D",,,"UWThPh-1999-38","gr-qc",,"  This is the second in a series of papers describing a 3+1 computational
scheme for the numerical simulation of dynamic black hole spacetimes. We
discuss the numerical time-evolution of a given black-hole-containing initial
data slice in spherical symmetry. We avoid singularities via the ""black-hole
exclusion"" or ""horizon boundary condition"" technique, where the slices meet the
black hole's singularity, but on each slice a spatial neighbourhood of the
singularity is excluded from the domain of the numerical computations.
  After first discussing some of the key design choices which arise with the
black hole exclusion technique, we then give a detailed description of our
numerical evolution scheme for spherically symmetric scalar field evolution,
assuming that a black hole is already present on the initial slice. We use a
free evolution, with Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinates and the inner
boundary placed at a fixed coordinate radius well inside the horizon.
  Our numerical scheme is based on the method of lines (MOL), where spacetime
PDEs are first finite differenced in space only, yielding a system of coupled
ODEs for the time evolution of the field variables along the spatial-grid-point
world lines. These ODEs are then time-integrated by standard methods. We use
4th order finite differencing in both space and time, with 5 and/or 6 point
spatial molecules (off-centered near the grid boundaries), and a Runge-Kutta
time integrator. The spatial grid is smoothly nonuniform, but not adaptive.
  We present numerical black hole + scalar field evolutions showing that this
scheme is stable, can evolve ""forever"" (we have gone to t > 4000m), and is very
accurate. At a resolution Delta_r/r = 3% near the horizon, typical errors in
g_ij(K_ij) at t=100m are <= 1e-5(3e-7), and the energy constraint is < 3e-5.

large compact dimensions, whereas all the SM particles are localized on a
$(1+3)$-dimensional subspace. In the formulation of minimal leptogenesis
models, we pay particular attention to the existence of Majorana spinors in
higher dimensions. After compactification of the extra dimensions, we obtain a
tower of Majorana Kaluza-Klein excitations which act as an infinite series of
CP-violating resonators, and derive the necessary conditions for their
constructive interference. Based on this CP-violating mechanism, we find that
the decays of the heavy Majorana excitations can produce a leptonic asymmetry
which is reprocessed into the observed baryonic asymmetry of the Universe by
means of out-of-equilibrium sphaleron interactions, provided the reheat
temperature is above 5 GeV.

will be discovered at LEP2, we find the following 95% CL bounds: M > 3.5 TeV

confined to our 4 dimensions). In the second case Kaluza Klein modes give
""universal""corrections and a good fit of precision data can be obtained with an
