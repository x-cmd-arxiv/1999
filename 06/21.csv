rate exceeds its value derived from the Eddington limit: L_{Edd}/c^2. We use
the scenario that was proposed by Shakura and Sunyaev (1973) for the
supercritical regime, according to which matter flows out of the gas-disk
surface under radiation pressure. An analytic solution of the accretion-disk
structure is obtained for this scenario by using classical equations. An
attempt is made to construct a model for nonconservative supercritical
accretion with advection. To this end, we develop a numerical scheme for
calculating the structure of an advective disk with mass outflow. The goal of
solving the problem of a supercritical disk with mass loss is to explain
accreting sources with outflowing envelopes, for example, SS 433 and galactic
nuclei. The structure and observational manifestations of the envelope which
forms around a supercritical disk are considered by taking into account
bremsstrahlung absorption and Thomson scattering of photons.

present the UV data obtained during the above multiwavelength campaign. A
maximum UV variation of ~50% is detected, while during the same period the
X-ray flux varied by no more than 13%. At the lowest UV flux level the average
spectrum in the 1230-2700 A interval is unusually flat for this object
(<alpha_UV>~1). The flattening could represent the lowest energy tail of the
inverse Compton component responsible for the X-ray emission, or could be due
to the presence of a thermal component at ~20000 K possibly associated with an
accretion disk. The presence of an accretion disk in this blazar object, likely
observable only in very low states and otherwise hidden by the beamed, variable
synchrotron component, would be consistent with the scenario in which the seed
photons for the inverse Compton mechanism producing the gamma-rays are external
to the relativistic jet. We further discuss the long term correlation of the UV
flux with the X-ray and gamma-ray fluxes obtained at various epochs. All UV
archival data are included in the analysis. Both the X- and gamma-ray fluxes
are generally well correlated with the UV flux, approximately with square root

spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies from far-UV to radio
wavelengths. In order to derive the SEDs in this broad spectral range, we first
couple spectrophotometric and (closed-box) chemical evolutions to account for
metallicity effects on the spectra of synthetic stellar populations. We then
use a phenomenological fit for the metal-dependent extinction curve and a
simple geometric distribution of the dust to compute the optical depth of
galaxies and the corresponding obscuration curve. This enables us to calculate
the fraction of stellar light reprocessed in the infrared range. In a final
step, we define a dust model with various components and we fix the weights of
these components in order to reproduce the IRAS correlation of IR colours with
total IR luminosities. This allows us to compute far-IR SEDs that
phenomenologically mimic observed trends. We are able to predict the spectral
evolution of galaxies in a broad wavelength range, and we can reproduce the
observed SEDs of local spirals, starbursts, luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs)
and ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). This modelling is so far kept as
simple as possible and depends on a small number of free parameters, namely the
initial mass function (IMF), star formation rate (SFR) time scale, gas density,
and galaxy age, as well as on more refined assumptions on dust properties and
the presence (or absence) of gas inflows/outflows.

atomic structure of crystal lattices. A polyatomic structure T can be defined
as an integer lattice in dimension D>=2, whose points may be occupied by $c$
distinct types of atoms. To ``analyze'' T, we conduct ell measurements that we
call_discrete X-rays_. A discrete X-ray in direction xi determines the number
of atoms of each type on each line parallel to xi. Given ell such non-parallel
X-rays, we wish to reconstruct T.
  The complexity of the problem for c=1 (one atom type) has been completely
determined by Gardner, Gritzmann and Prangenberg, who proved that the problem
is NP-complete for any dimension D>=2 and ell>=3 non-parallel X-rays, and that
it can be solved in polynomial time otherwise.
  The NP-completeness result above clearly extends to any c>=2, and therefore
when studying the polyatomic case we can assume that ell=2. As shown in another
article by the same authors, this problem is also NP-complete for c>=6 atoms,
even for dimension D=2 and axis-parallel X-rays. They conjecture that the
problem remains NP-complete for c=3,4,5, although, as they point out, the proof
idea does not seem to extend to c<=5.
  We resolve the conjecture by proving that the problem is indeed NP-complete
for c>=3 in 2D, even for axis-parallel X-rays. Our construction relies heavily
on some structure results for the realizations of 0-1 matrices with given row
and column sums.

the perspective of chirality. It also reviews at length the phenomenon of

anomalies based on the Dirac sea picture as given by Nielsen and Ninomiya. It
then raises the issue of a non-perturbative and constructive definition of the
standard model as well as the importance of such formulations. The second

theories under some general assumptions is also discussed. After a brief review
of lattice regularisation of field theories, it discusses the issue of fermions
on the lattice with special emphasis on the problem of species doubling. The
implications of these problems to introducing chiral fermions on the lattice as
well as the interpretations of anomalies within the lattice formulations and

formulating the standard model on the lattice are illustrated through detailed
discussions of the Wilson-Yukawa method, the domain wall fermions method and

  In the hands of an eavesdropper -- a quantum memory is a powerful tool,
putting in question the security of quantum cryptography; Classical privacy
amplification techniques, used to prove security against less powerful
eavesdroppers, might not be effective when the eavesdropper can keep quantum
states for a long time. In this work we suggest a possible direction for
approaching this problem. We define strong attacks of this type, and show
security against them, suggesting that quantum cryptography is secure. We start
with a complete analysis regarding the information about a parity bit (since
parity bits are used for privacy amplification). We use the results regarding
the information on parity bits to prove security against very strong
eavesdropping attacks, which uses quantum memories and all classical data
(including error correction codes) to attack the final key directly.
  In the hands of the legitimate users, a quantum memory is also a useful tool.
We suggest a new type of quantum key distribution scheme where quantum memories
are used instead of quantum channels. This scheme is especially adequate for
networks of many users. The use of quantum memory also allows reducing the
error rate to improve large scale quantum cryptography, and to enable the
legitimate users to work with reasonable error rate.

  schemes were also presented by Norbert Lutkenhaus in the same conference",,"10.1007/0-306-47097-7_51",,"quant-ph",,"  The use of quantum bits (qubits) in cryptography holds the promise of secure
cryptographic quantum key distribution schemes. It is based usually on
single-photon polarization states. Unfortunately, the implemented ``qubits'' in
the usual weak pulse experiments are not true two-level systems, and quantum
key distribution based on these imperfect qubits is totally insecure in the
presence of high (realistic) loss rate. In this work, we investigate another
potential implementation: qubits generated using a process of parametric
downconversion. We find that, to first (two-photon) and second (four-photon)
order in the parametric downconversion small parameter, this implementation of
quantum key distribution is equivalent to the theoretical version.
  Once realistic measurements are taken into account, quantum key distribution
based on parametric downconversion suffers also from sensitivity to extremely
high (nonrealistic) losses. By choosing the small parameter of the process
according to the loss rates, both implementations of quantum key distribution
can in principle become secure against the attack studied in this paper.
However, adjusting the small parameter to the required levels seems to be
impractical in the weak pulse process. On the other hand, this can easily be
done in the parametric downconversion process, making it a much more promising
implementation.
