non-standard possibilities for the large-scale Universe -- rotation or shear,
non-trivial topology, and single topological defects are specific examples.
All-sky (or nearly all-sky) CMB data sets allow us, uniquely, to constrain such
exotica, and it is therefore worthwhile to explore a wide range of statistical
tests. We describe one such statistic here, which is based on determining
gradients and is useful for assessing the level of `preferred directionality'
or `stripiness' in the map. This method is more general than other techniques
for picking out specific patterns on the sky, and it also has the advantage of
being easily calculable for the mega-pixel maps which will soon be available.
For the purposes of illustration, we apply this statistic to the four-year COBE
DMR data. For future CMB maps we expect this to be a useful statistical test of
the large scale structure of the Universe. In principle, the same statistic
could also be applied to sky maps at other wavelengths, to CMB polarisation
maps, and to catalogues of discrete objects. It may also be useful as a means
of checking for residual directionality (e.g., from Galactic or ecliptic
signals) in maps.

secondary that is much more luminous and hotter than is appropriate for a
low-mass subgiant. We present detailed binary-evolution calculations which
demonstrate that the present evolutionary state of Cyg X-2 can be understood if
the secondary had an initial mass of around 3.5 M_sun and started to transfer
mass near the end of its main-sequence phase (or, somewhat less likely, just
after leaving the main sequence). Most of the mass of the secondary must have
been ejected from the system during an earlier rapid mass-transfer phase. In
the present phase, the secondary has a mass of around 0.5 M_sun with a
non-degenerate helium core. It is burning hydrogen in a shell, and mass
transfer is driven by the advancement of the burning shell. Cyg X-2 therefore
is related to a previously little studied class of intermediate-mass X-ray
binaries (IMXBs). We suggest that perhaps a significant fraction of X-ray
binaries presently classified as low-mass X-ray binaries may be descendants of
IMXBs and discuss some of the implications.

  Sellwood and M. Valluri",,,"Rutgers Astrophysics Preprint Series No. 249","astro-ph",,"  The consequences of nuclear black holes for the structure and dynamics of
stellar spheroids are reviewed. Slow growth of a black hole in a pre-existing
core produces a steep power-law density profile similar to the cusps seen in
faint elliptical galaxies. The weaker cusps in bright ellipticals may result
from ejection of stars by a coalescing black-hole binary; there is marginal
kinematical evidence for such a process having occurred in M87. Stellar orbits
in a triaxial nucleus are mostly regular at radii where the gravitational force
is dominated by the black hole; however the orbital shapes are not conducive to
reinforcing the triaxial figure, hence nuclei are likely to be approximately
axisymmetric. In triaxial potentials, a ``zone of chaos'' extends outward to a
radius where the enclosed stellar mass is roughly 100 times the mass of the
black hole; in this chaotic zone, no regular, box-like orbits exist. At larger
radii, the phase space in triaxial potentials is complex, consisting of
stochastic orbits as well as regular orbits associated with stable resonances.
Figure rotation tends to increase the degree of stochasticity. Both
test-particle integrations and N-body simulations suggest that a triaxial
galaxy responds globally to the presence of a central mass concentration by
evolving toward more axisymmetric shapes; the evolution occurs rapidly when the
mass of the central object exceeds roughly 2% of the mass in stars. The lack of
significant triaxiality in most early-type galaxies may be a consequence of
orbital evolution induced by nuclear black holes.

galactic center have provided strong evidence for a dark mass of 2.5 million
solar masses in the central 0.05 pc of the galaxy. The leading hypothesis for
this mass is a black hole. High angular resolution measurements at radio
wavelengths find a compact radio source, Sagittarius (Sgr) A*, that is either
the faint glow from a small amount of material accreting onto the hole with low
radiative efficiency or a miniature AGN core-jet system.
  We provide in this paper a full report on the first program that has measured
the apparent proper motion of Sgr A* with respect to background extragalactic
reference frame. Our current result is: mu_l,*=[-6.18+/-0.19] mas/y and
mu_b,*=[-0.65+/-0.17] mas/y. The observations were obtained with the NRAO Very
Large Array at 4.9 GHz over sixteen years. The proper motion of Sgr A* provides
an estimate of its mass based on equipartition of kinetic energy between the
hole and the surrounding stars. The measured motion is largest in galactic
longitude. This component of the motion is consistent with the secular parallax
that results from the rotation of the solar system about the center, which is a
global measure of Oort's constants (A-B), with no additional peculiar motion of
Sgr A*. The current uncertainty in Oort's galactic rotation constants limits
the use of this component of the proper motion for a mass inference. In
latitude we find a small, and weakly significant, peculiar motion of Sgr A*,
-19+/-7 km/s after correction for the motion of the solar system with respect
to the local standard of rest.

that the circumnuclear gas of NLSy1s is different to BLSy1s in temperature,

  Astronomy, Internal Report",,,,"astro-ph",,"  When measuring diameters of partially resolved sources like planetary
nebulae, H II regions or galaxies, often a technique called gaussian
deconvolution is used. This technique yields a gaussian diameter which
subsequently has to be multiplied with a conversion factor to obtain the true
angular diameter of the source. This conversion factor is a function of the
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the beam. It also depends on the intrinsic
surface brightness distribution of the source.
  In this paper the theory behind this technique will be studied. This study
will be restricted to circularly symmetric geometries and beams. First an
implicit equation will be derived, from which the conversion factor for a given
surface brightness distribution and beam size can be solved. Explicit
expressions for the conversion factor will be derived from this equation which
are valid in cases where the beam size is larger than the intrinsic size of the
source. A more detailed discussion will be given for two simple geometries: a
circular constant surface brightness disk and a spherical constant emissivity
shell with arbitrary inner radius. The theory is subsequently used to construct
a new technique for determining the FWHM of an arbitrary observed surface
brightness distribution.
  Usually the FWHM of the source and beam are measured using gaussian fits, but
second moments can also be used. The alternative use of second moments in this
context is studied here for the first time and it is found that in this case
the conversion factor has a different value which is independent of the beam
size. In the limit for infinitely large beam sizes, the values of the
conversion factors for both techniques are equal.

We show that the behavior of the synthetic mean magnitudes and colors fully
reproduces the observed trend of Galactic Cepheids, supporting the validity of
the model predictions. In the second part of the paper we show how the estimate
of the mean reddening and true distance modulus of a galaxy from Cepheid VK
photometry depend on the adopted metal content, in the sense that larger
metallicities drive the host galaxy to lower extinctions and distances.
Conversely, self-consistent estimates of the Cepheid mean reddening, distance
and metallicity may be derived if three-filter data are taken into account. By
applying the theoretical PL and PLC relations to available BVK data of Cepheids

data from the Hipparcos catalogue suggests they are true halo members. The
remaining two, for which proper-motion data are not available, may have
disc-like kinematics. It is therefore clear that it is useful to address
properties of putative metal-weak thick-disc stars only if they possess full
kinematic data. For CS 22894-19 the abundance pattern similar to those of
typical halo stars is found, suggesting that chemical composition is not a
useful discriminant between thick-disc and halo stars. CS 29529-12 is found to
be C enhanced with [C/Fe]=+1.0; other chemical peculiarities involve the s

evidence of a strong interaction between the radio jet and the NE morphology of

ionization from a precursor HII region, produced itself by the ionizing photons

observations. We investigate the spatial behavior of the ionizing parameter
$U$, by determining the [OIII]/[OII] line ratio which is sensitive to the
change of the ionization parameter, and trace its behavior over the ENLR along
the radio jet direction. We find that [OIII]/[OII] does not follow a simple
dilution model, but rather that it is approximately constant over a large range
of distance from the nucleus thus requiring a local source of ionization which
seems to be compatible with the shock models driven by the radio jet.

and $\epsilon_B$ are consistent with the suggestion that they may be universal
parameters, comparing to those inferred for GRB970508; 2) the reverse external
shock may have become relativistic before it passed through the ejecta shell.

to calibrate a hybrid library (consisting of the Kurucz -, the Allard and

solar metallicity models were calibrated using an algorithm developed by

isochrones of metal-poor clusters. In particular, the observed slope and/or

magnetic order at $T\sim 1$K. The Curie-Weiss temperature, $\theta_{CW}$ =

law occur below $\sim$10K while magnetic heat capacity contributions are found
at temperatures above 20K. A sharp maximum in the heat capacity at $T_c=0.97$K
signals a transition to a long range ordered state, with the magnetic specific
accounting for only $\sim$ 50% of the magnetic entropy. The heat capacity above
the phase transition can be modeled by assuming that a distribution of random

frequency dependence to the a.c. susceptibility in either the short range or
long range ordered regimes, hence suggesting the absence of any spin-glassy
behavior. Mean field theoretical calculations show that no long range ordered
ground state exists for the conditions of nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic
exchange and long range dipolar couplings. At the mean-field level, long range

carried out for different distances between the fragments tips and excitation
energies. For a given deformation, the fragment's total energy is computed via
the constrained Hartree-Fock + BCS formalism. The total excitation energy
present in the fragments is supposed to contribute only to the fragments
deformation and the asymptotic value of the kinetic energy is equated to the
inter-fragment potential at scission. These two constraints yield not more than
one or two fission channels for a fixed tip distance and excitation energy.

results is obtained for certain temperatures. This agreement includes a
size-dependent smearing out of fine-structure features, accompanied by a
measurable reduction of the heights of the steps marking major-shell and
subshell closings, thus allowing for a quantitative analysis of cluster
temperatures.

  focus on clarity of ""language"" (quantum physics and neuroscience) used. The
  amended version contains a new section with reference to recent publications
  on quantum effects in the brain",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Current quantum theories of consciousness suggest a configuration space of an
entangled ensemble state as global work space for conscious experience. This
study will describe a procedure for adjustment of the singlet evolution of a
quantum computation to a classical signal input by action potentials. The
computational output of an entangled state in a single neuron will be selected
in a network environment by ""survival of the fittest"" coupling with other
neurons. Darwinian evolution of this coupling will result in a binding of
action potentials to a convoluted orbit of phase-locked oscillations with
harmonic, m-adic, or fractal periodicity. Progressive integration of signal
inputs will evolve a present memory space independent from the history of
construction. Implications for mental processes, e.g., associative memory,
creativity, and consciousness will be discussed. A model for the generation of
quantum coherence in a single neuron will be suggested.

  potential","8 pages, 9 figures",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This paper is devoted to the study of quantum dissipation in cluster decay
phenomena in the frame of the Lindblad approach to quantum open systems. The
tunneling of a metastable state across a piecewise quadratic potential is
envisaged for two cases : one and two harmonic wells smoothly joined to an
inverted parabola which simulates the barrier. The width and depth of the
second harmonic oscillator well was varied over a wide range of values in order
to encompass particular cases of tunneling such as the double well potential
and the cluster decay. The evolution of the averages and covariances of the
quantum sub-system is studied in both under- and overdamped regimes. For a
gaussian intial wave-packet we compute the tunneling probability for different
values of the friction coefficient and fixed values of the diffusion
coefficients.

systems are analyzed in relation to information theory. We show that hidden
variable theories would lead to a Shannon index of correlation between the
entangled subsystems which is larger that that predicted by quantum mechanics.
Canonical representations which have maximal correlations are treated by the
use of Schmidt decomposition of the entangled states, including especially the
Bohm singlet state and the GHZ entangled states. We show that quantum mechanics
does not violate locality, but does violate realism.
