The Astrophysical Journal (Letters), in press",,"10.1086/312201",,"astro-ph",,"  The electron scattering region (ESR) is one of important ingredients in
Seyfert nuclei because it makes possible to observe the hidden broad line
region (hereafter HBLR) in some type 2 Seyfert nuclei (hereafter S2s). However,
little is known about its physical and geometrical properties. Using the number
ratio of S2s with and without HBLR, we investigate statistically where the ESR
is in Seyfert nuclei. Our analysis suggests that the ESR is located at radius
between $\sim$ 0.01 pc and $\sim$ 0.1 pc from the central engine. We also
discuss a possible origin of the ESR briefly.

showed that positive Turing reduction to NP yields no greater computational
power than NP itself. Thus, positive Turing and Turing reducibility to NP
differ sharply unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
  We show that the situation is quite different for DP, the next level of the
boolean hierarchy. In particular, positive Turing reduction to DP already
yields all (and only) sets Turing reducibility to NP. Thus, positive Turing and
Turing reducibility to DP yield the same class. Additionally, we show that an
even weaker class, P(NP[1]), can be substituted for DP in this context.

the theory. In this situation, the generating meromorphic 1-form of the Whitham

of meromorphic 1-forms associated with these Whitham times, but it turns out

many-body problem of nonrelativistic nucleons interacting through a static
potential. We discuss several of the uncontrolled approximations that are made
in this model to motivate a different approach, one based on an exact solution
of the Bloch-Horowitz equation. We argue that the necessary self-consistent
solutions of this equation can be obtained efficiently by a Green's function
expansion based on the Lanczos algorithm. The resulting effective theory is
carried out for the simplest nuclei, d and 3He, using realistic NN interactions
such as the Argonne v18 and Reid93 potentials, in order to contrast the results
with the shell model. We discuss the wave function normalization, the evolution
of the wave function as the ""shell model"" space is varied, and the magnetic
elastic effective operator. The numerical results show a simple renormalization
group behavior that differs from effective field theory treatments of the two-
and three-body problems. The likely origin of this scaling is discussed.
