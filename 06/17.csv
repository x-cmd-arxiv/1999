a small dust lane. Complex arcs seen in scattered light surround the central

reflect perturbations from multiple stellar sources or from time-dependent mass
ejection. A second, resolved continuum source is found at a projected distance
of approximately 1150 AU from the central region, near the edge of a nebular

is another low-luminosity young stellar object, seen nearly edge-on through a

the scattered light ``streaks'' associated with this second source are
limb-brightened outflow cavities in the dusty envelope, possibly perturbed by
interaction with the outflow lobes of the main source. The nature of the
companion is uncertain, since it is observed mostly in scattered light, but is
most probably a very low mass star or brown dwarf, with a minimum luminosity of

  Journal",,"10.1086/301062",,"astro-ph",,"  The detailed distribution of dust in the disks of spiral galaxies is
important to understanding the radiative transfer within disks, and to
measuring overall dust masses if significant quantities of dust are either very
opaque or very cold. We address this issue by comparing measures of dust
absorption, using the galaxy-overlap technique in the optical, with measures of
the dust grains' thermal emission from 50-2000 micron using ISOPHOT on board
ISO and SCUBA at the JCMT. We examine three spiral galaxies projected partially
in front of E/S0 galaxies --- AM1316-241, NGC 5545, and NGC 5091 (for NGC 5091
we have only optical and ISO data). Adopting an empirical exponential model for
the dust distribution, we compare column densities and dust masses derived from
the absorption and emission techniques. This comparison is sensitive to the
amount of dust mass in small, opaque structures, which would not contribute
strongly to area-weighted absorption measures, and to very cold dust, which
would contribute to optical absorption but provide only a small fraction of the
sub-mm emission. In AM1316-241, we find global dust masses of 2-5 x 10^7
M_solar, both techniques agreeing at the 50% level. NGC 5545 has about half
this dust mass. The concordance of dust masses is well within the errors
expected from our knowledge of the radial distribution of dust, and argues
against any dominant part of the dust mass being so cold or opaque. The 50-2000
micron data are well fitted by modified Planck functions with an emissivity law
beta=-2, at 21 +/- 2 K. We also present 12 micron ISOCAM observations of these
pairs.Comparison of H-alpha and 12 micron images of NGC 5545 indicate that

reported in several studies. This cross-correlation has been interpreted in
terms of a low redshift and a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN)
population, clustered similar to optically bright galaxies, as responsible for
the unresolved component of the XRB. In contrast to such a low redshift
population, we suggest that a correlation between the unresolved XRB and bright

AGNs through weak lensing effects of low redshift large scale structure traced
by foreground optical galaxies. We further investigate this possibility and
suggest that a substantial fraction of the detected cross-correlation signal
can arise from this scenario. The most likely explanation for the observed
cross-correlation is that both a population of low redshift sources and a
population of high redshift low luminous sources contribute through clustering
and lensing effects, respectively. The exact weak gravitational lensing
contribution to the detected signal can eventually be used to constrain
cosmological parameters, foreground galaxy bias and, more importantly, models
of high redshift X-ray emitting sources.

of CO isotopomers were observed at the same angular resolution as C I. The C I
peak TA* is typically a third of the peak TA* of 13CO J = 2-1, and the C I
emission is usually more extended than emission in 13CO or C18O J=2-1. The C I

line width, and smaller than the 12CO J = 2-1 linewidth. The uniformity of the
C I peak TA* is remarkable for a line in the Wien portion of the Planck

is best explained if the line if opaque and thermalized. If so, the CI line
probes kinetic temperature in clouds exposed to low ultraviolet fluxes. This
conclusion has significant implications for the thermal balance in such clouds.
At Av ~ 2, these clouds have a remarkably constant temperature from place to
place and from cloud to cloud (7.9+/-0.8 K). Photodissociation region models of

stronger lines than we see, but this may be an artifact of assumptions about

to trace the overall magnetic field in the inner Galaxy, the Pelican is the
first detection of a component of this field parallel to the plane. The Pelican

significantly reduced, compared to similar galaxy samples published previously.
The CM relation can be used to determine distances to field spiral galaxies
with M_K > -25.5, to at least M_K ~ -20. Our results, supplemented with
previously published observations for which we can - to some degree - control
the effects of extinction, are consistent with a universal nature of the CM
relation for field spiral galaxies. High-resolution observations done with the
Hubble Space Telescope can provide a powerful tool to calibrate the relation
and extend the useful distance range by more than a factor of 2 compared to
ground-based observations. The intrinsic scatter in the NIR CM relation in the
absolute K-band magnitudes is ~0.5 mag, yielding a lower limit to the accuracy
of distance determinations on the order of 25%. Although we find an unusually
low scatter in the TFR (probably a statistical accident), a typical scatter in
the TFR would yield distances to our sample galaxies with uncertainties of only
about 15%. However, one of the main advantages of the use of the NIR CM

use of the TFR requires additional kinematic data, although it can be used to

second most distant cluster of galaxies in the Einstein Extended Medium
Sensitivity Survey (EMSS), at redshift 0.78. We now have X-ray temperatures,
velocity dispersions, and X-ray images for a complete, high-redshift sample of
EMSS clusters. ASCA observations of MS1137.5+6625 yield a temperature of 5.7
+2.1, -1.1 keV and a metallicity of 0.43 +0.40,-0.37 solar (90% confidence).
Keck-II spectroscopy of 22 cluster members reveals a velocity dispersion of 884
+185, -124 km/s. ROSAT observations show that MS1137.5+6625 is regular and
centrally concentrated. A beta-model fit yields a core radius of only 71 h^{-1}
kpc (q_0=0.1) with beta=0.70 +0.45,-0.15. The gas fraction is 0.06 +/-0.04
h^{-3/2}. This is the highest redshift EMSS cluster with a possible cooling
flow (~20-400 solar masses/yr). The velocity dispersion, temperature, gas
fraction, and iron abundance of MS1137 are statistically the same as those
properties in low-z clusters of similar luminosity. We derive a high-z
temperature function for EMSS clusters with 0.5 < z < 0.9 and compare it with
temperature functions at lower redshifts, showing that evolution of the
temperature function is relatively modest. Supplementing our high-z sample with
other data, we demonstrate that neither the cluster L-T relation, nor cluster
metallicities, nor the cluster gas fraction has detectably evolved with
redshift. The very modest degree of evolution in the L-T relation inferred from
these data is inconsistent with the absence of evolution in the X-ray
luminosity functions derived from ROSAT cluster surveys if a critical-density
structure formation model is assumed.

For strong interaction, corresponding experimentally to oppositely charged
species, the cac is much lower than the cmc. It increases with ionic strength
and depends only weakly on polymer charge. For weak interaction, the cac is
lower but comparable to the cmc, and the two are roughly proportional over a
wide range of cmc values. Association of small molecules with amphiphilic
polymers exhibiting intra-chain aggregation (polysoaps) is gradual, having no
sharp onset.

found to decay to a non-zero, dilution-dependent, value $P(\infty)$. We find
that $p(t)=P(t)-P(\infty)$ decays exponentially to zero at large times.
Furthermore, the fraction of spins which never flip is a monotonically
increasing function over the range of bond-dilution considered. Our findings,

field (ZPF) may actively accelerate electromagnetically interacting particles
in regions of extremely low particle density (as those extant in intergalactic

energizing phenomenon has been one of the few contenders for acceleration of
cosmic rays (CR), particularly at ultrahigh energies. The recent finding by the
AGASA collaboration (Phys. Rev. Lett., 81, 1163, 1998) that the CR energy
spectrum does not display any signs of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off
(that should be present if these CR particles were indeed generated in
localized ultrahigh energies CR sources, as e.g., quasars and other highly
active galactic nuclei), may indicate the need for an acceleration mechanism
that is distributed throughout IGS as is the case with the ZPF. Other
unexplained phenomena that receive an explanation from this mechanism are the
generation of X-ray and gamma-ray backgrounds and the existence of Cosmic
Voids. However recently, a statistical mechanics kind of challenge to the
classical (not the quantum) version of the zero-point acceleration mechanism
has been posed (de la Pena and Cetto, The Quantum Dice, 1996). Here we briefly

accelerating observer will experience a bath of radiation resulting from the
quantum vacuum which mimics that of a heat bath, the so-called Davies-Unruh
effect. We have further analyzed this problem of an accelerated object moving
through the vacuum and have shown that the zero-point field will yield a
non-zero Poynting vector to an accelerating observer. Scattering of this
radiation by the quarks and electrons constituting matter would result in an
acceleration-dependent reaction force that would appear to be the origin of
inertia of matter (Rueda and Haisch 1998a, 1998b). In the subrelativistic case
this inertia reaction force is exactly newtonian and in the relativistic case
it exactly reproduces the well known relativistic extension of Newton's Law.
This analysis demonstrates then that both the ordinary, F=ma, and the
relativistic forms of Newton's equation of motion may be derived from Maxwell's
equations as applied to the electromagnetic zero-point field. We expect to be
able to extend this analysis in the future to more general versions of the
quantum vacuum than just the electromagnetic one discussed herein.

arising from the b-quark transverse motion in the $\bar B$-meson. Using various
b-quark light-front (LF) distribution functions, both phenomenological one and
the ones derived from current constituent quark models, and neglecting
perturbative corrections we compute the photon energy spectra and the moments
of the shape function. It is shown that the parton-like approach is fully
consistent with the Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) provided the b-quark
constituent mass is redefined in the way similar to that used in HQET to define
the pole mass of the b quark. In this way the correction to first order in
$1/m_b$ can be eliminated from the total width in agreement with the general
statement of HQET. We have also found that the photon energy spectra calculated

moduli whose potential originates from SUSY breaking are the origin of the

nucleosynthesis, and a consistent theory of baryogenesis requires that there be
renormalizable baryon number violating interactions at the TeV scale. The dark

that the fundamental quark is confined even if $G=SU(3)$ is broken by partial

  There is ample precedent for considering this subring in the parallel case of

of our construction is to remedy this. We also also develop a kind of

described by solutions $u$ of the PDE: $\Delta u(x)+K(x)\exp(2u(x))=0$, with
$K(x)$ the Gauss curvature function at $x\in\RR^2$. We assume that the integral
curvature is finite. For radially symmetric $K$ we introduce the notion of a
least integrally curved surface, and also the notion of when such a surface is
critical. With respect to these notions we analyze the radial symmetry of $u$
for the whole spectrum of possible integral curvature values. Under a mild
integrability condition which rules out harmonic non-radial behavior near
infinity, we prove that $u$ is radially symmetric and decreasing in the
following categories: (1) $K$ is decreasing, $u$ a classical solution, and the
integral curvature of the surface is above critical; (2) $K$ is decreasing, $u$
a classical solution, the integral curvature of the surface is critical, and
the surface satisfies an additional integrability condition which is mildly
stronger than finite integral curvature; (3) $K$ is non-positive. In categories
1 and 2, $K$ is allowed to diverge logarithmically or as power law to $-\infty$
at spatial infinity. Examples of nonradial solutions which violate one or more
of our conditions are discussed as well. In particular, for non-positive and
non-negative $K$ that satisfy appropriate integrability conditions and
otherwise are fairly arbitrary, we introduce probabilistic methods to construct
surfaces with finite integral curvature and entire harmonic asymptotics at
infinity. For radial symmetric $K$ these surfaces are examples of broken
symmetry.

elements of reality, or `induced' elements of reality - originally invoked as
an ad-hoc collapse postulate, we propose a novel line of interference
experiments which may be able to examine the regime of induced elements of
reality. At the basis of the proposed experiment, lies the hypothesis that all
models of 'induced' elements of reality should exhibit symmetry breaking within
quantum evolution. The described {\em symmetry experiment} is thus aimed at
being able to detect and resolve symmetry breaking signatures.
