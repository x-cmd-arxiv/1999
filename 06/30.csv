of the more extended fractal in the Universe. At even larger scales, the

but more limited, may be over 3-4 orders of magnitude in scales. These two
fractals appear to be characterized by similar Hausdorff dimensions, between
1.6 and 2. The various interpretations of these structures are discussed, in
particular formation theories based on turbulence and self-gravity. In the
latter, the fractal ensembles are considered in a critical state, as in second
order phase transitions, when large density fluctuations are observed, that
also obey scaling laws, and look self-similar over an extended range.

mandatory, leading to the need to solve moderately sized matrix equations.
Efforts to improve the performance of such rate equation methods are focused on
efficient solution of these matrix equations, by making best use of the
sparseness of these matrices. Recent work to produce hybrid schemes which use
local equilibria to reduce the computational cost of the rate equations is also
discussed. Such schemes offer significant improvements in the speed of reaction
networks and are accurate under circumstances where calculations with complete

the velocities are with respect to the velocity of the Pistol Star; further,
the redshifted emission appears to be ""flattened"" in the position-velocity

the stellar wind (95 km/s) and the present expansion velocity of gas in the

emission-line stars in the region, including two newly-identified emission-line

pre-supernova collapsing stars before the neutrino trapping sets in, can yield
useful information on the physical conditions and on the nuclear composition of
the core. The neutrino spectrum depends on the thermodynamic conditions of the
core, the nuclear abundances, the lepton fractions and relevant nuclear
properties. In the pre-trapping core of a core-collapse supernova, the density
ranges from $0.1 - 100~10^{10}$ g/cm$^3$ and the temperature from $0.2 - 1.5$
MeV. The nuclear abundances as well as the electron capture rates are thus
determined, among other things, by the nuclear binding energies and the free
nucleon chemical potentials. Because shell and pairing effects persist strongly
up to temperatures of $\simeq 0.5$ MeV, any equation of state (EOS) relevant to
this phase of the collapse must reproduce well the zero temperature nuclear
properties and it must show a smooth transition to the known high temperature
and high density limits. In this work we use the microscopic Relativistic Mean
Field (RMF) theory based on a Lagrangian with non-linear self-interactions of
the $\sigma$-field for the neutron-rich nuclei of interest in the $f-p$ shell
to determine nuclear chemical potentials. We compare these results with those
computed from an EOS calculated with the macroscopic liquid drop model. We also
discuss extensions to finite temperature and we incorporate nuclear lattice
effects into the microscopic calculations.

observations of Cepheids in the nearby galaxy IC 1613. Since the program was
carried out with a relatively small telescope, the Dutch 0.9 m at ESO-La Silla,
the observations were performed without filter (white light), or Wh-band; the
advantage of this technique is that the photon statistics correspond to that of
V-band observations made with larger telescopes than 2 m and similar exposure
time. The effective wavelength of the Wh-band is intermediate between that of V
and R bands for stars of A-G spectral type, for back-illuminated CCD detectors.
The analysis of the observations of Field A revealed the presence of about 110
variable stars. The detected population I Cepheids are 43; 9 Cepheids were
already known from previous works, while most of the new stars have a short
period P. For stars with P > 5 d and sufficient phase coverage it is possible
to perform good Fourier decomposition of light curves with resulting standard
deviation of the fit of 0.02 - 0.04 mag. There are several Cepheids with
relatively small amplitude, and most of them are first overtone mode pulsators;
the faintest detected Cepheids have V about 23 and P about 1 day. At least 5
population II Cepheids and 8 eclipsing binaries have been observed. The other
variable stars are probable long period, semiregular and irregular variables. A
comparison with results of other massive CCD photometric projects dedicated to
the detection of variable stars shows some advantages of the observations in
white light for fully exploiting the capabilities of relatively small

combines 15 and 7micron ISOCAM observations with DENIS IJKs data to determine

an ISOGAL study of a small field in the inner Galactic Bulge (l=0deg, b=1.0deg,
area=0.035 sq. deg) as a prototype of the larger area ISOGAL survey of the
inner Galaxy. The five wavelengths of ISOGAL+DENIS, together with the
relatively low and constant extinction in front of this specific field, allow
reliable determination of the nature of the sources. The primary scientific
result of this paper is evidence that the most numerous class of ISOGAL
15micron sources are Red Giants in the Galactic bulge and central disk, with
luminosities just above or close to the RGB tip and weak mass-loss rates. They
form loose sequences in the magnitude-colour diagrams [15]/Ks-[15] and

7micron is due to circumstellar dust produced by mass-loss at low rates. These
ISOGAL results are the first systematic evidence and study of dust emission at

from sub-Alfv\'enic to super-Alfv\'enic flow has been made for nearly poloidal
and for helical magnetic fields. The jets are stable to asymmetric modes of jet
distortion provided they are sub-Alfv\'enic over most of their interior but
destabilize rapidly when they become on average super-Alfv\'enic. The jets are
precessed at the origin and the resulting small amplitude azimuthal motion is
communicated down the jet to the Alfv\'en point where it couples to a slowly
moving and rapidly growing helical twist. Significant jet rotation can
contribute to destabilization via increase in the velocity shear between the
jet and the external medium. Destabilization is accompanied by significant mass
entrainment and the jets slow down significantly as denser external material is
entrained. Synchrotron intensity images satisfactorily reveal large scale
helical structures but have trouble distinguishing a large amplitude elliptical
jet distortion that appears as an apparent pinching in an intensity image.
Smaller scale jet distortions are not clearly revealed in intensity images,
largely as a result of the relatively small total pressure variations that
accompany destabilization and growing distortions. Fractional polarization is
high as a result of the strong ordered magnetic fields except where the
intensity image suggests cancellation of polarization vectors by integration
through twisted structures.

into semi-analytic models that follow the formation and evolution of galaxies
in a cold dark matter dominated Universe. We assume that supermassive black
holes are formed and fuelled during major mergers. If two galaxies of
comparable mass merge, their central black holes coalesce and a few percent of
the gas in the merger remnant is accreted by the new black hole over a
timescale of a few times 10^7 years. With these simple assumptions, our model
not only fits many aspects of the observed evolution of galaxies, but also
reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between bulge luminosity and
black hole mass in nearby galaxies, the strong evolution of the quasar
population with redshift and the relation between the luminosities of nearby
quasars and those of their host galaxies. The strong decline in the number
density of quasars from z=2 to z=0 is due to the combination of three effects:
i) a decrease in the merging rate, ii) a decrease in the amount of cold gas
available to fuel black holes, and iii) an increase in the timescale for gas
accretion. In a LCDM cosmology the predicted decline in the total content of
cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that inferred from observations of
damped Lyman-alpha systems. Our results strongly suggest that the evolution of
supermassive black holes, quasars and starbursts is inextricably linked to the
hierarchical build-up of galaxies.

aligned on a line connecting the clusters. We found relative proper motions of
the components with ~30 mas/yr (18 AU/yr) along the line. In addition, a series
of single-dish observations show that the maser components drifted with a
radial acceleration of ~1 km/s/yr.
  These facts indicate that the masers could be excited by a 10 AU-scale
jet-like accelerating flow ejected from an assumed protostar located between
the two clusters. The outflow size traced by the masers was 50 AU x 5 AU after
correction for an inclination angle of 10 degrees which was derived from the
relative proper motions and radial velocities of the maser components. The
three-dimensional outflow velocity ranged from 40 to 70 km/s assuming symmetric
motions for the blue and red components. Since no distinct CO molecular
outflows have been detected so far, we suggest that S106 FIR is an extremely
young protostar observed just after the onset of outflowing activity.

synchronization is ruled by a new ingredient : the propagation velocity of

three-dimensional Sinai billiard, addressing a few outstanding problems in
""quantum chaos"". We were mainly concerned with the accuracy of the
semiclassical trace formula in two and higher dimensions and its ability to
explain the universal spectral statistics observed in quantized chaotic
systems. For this purpose we developed an efficient KKR algorithm to compute an
extensive and accurate set of quantal eigenvalues. We also constructed a
systematic method to compute millions of periodic orbits in a reasonable time.
Introducing a proper measure for the semiclassical error and using the quantum
and the classical databases for the Sinai billiards in two and three
dimensions, we concluded that the semiclassical error (measured in units of the
mean level spacing) is independent of the dimensionality, and diverges at most
as log \hbar. This is in contrast with previous estimates. The classical
spectrum of lengths of periodic orbits was studied and shown to be correlated
in a way which induces the expected (random matrix) correlations in the quantal
spectrum, corroborating previous results obtained in systems in two dimensions.
These and other subjects discussed in the report open the way to extending the
semiclassical study to chaotic systems with more than two freedoms.

dynamics is not required to be settled on its attractor, which also makes
transient motion accessible to the analysis. If the motion actually takes place
on a chaotic attractor, the applicability of the method does not depend on the
dimensionality of the chaotic attractor - one main advantage over all time
series analysis methods known until now. For demonstration, we analyze time
series, which are obtained with the help of the numerical integration of a

by the nature of the array and by its coupling to a thermal environment. For
example, in some arrays a pulse can be speeded up while in others a pulse can
be slowed down by raising the temperature. We begin by showing that an energy
pulse (1D) or energy front (2D) travels more rapidly and remains more localized
over greater distances in an isolated array (microcanonical) of hard springs
than in a harmonic array or in a soft-springed array. Increasing the pulse
amplitude causes it to speed up in a hard chain, leaves the pulse speed
unchanged in a harmonic system, and slows down the pulse in a soft chain.
Connection of each site to a thermal environment (canonical) affects these
results very differently in each type of array. In a hard chain the dissipative
forces slow down the pulse while raising the temperature speeds it up. In a
soft chain the opposite occurs: the dissipative forces actually speed up the
pulse while raising the temperature slows it down. In a harmonic chain neither
dissipation nor temperature changes affect the pulse speed. These and other
results are explained on the basis of the frequency vs energy relations in the
various arrays.

for a quantum scalar field of arbitrary mass and curvature coupling in a FRW
cosmological model. We introduce an adiabatic number basis which has the virtue
that the divergent parts of the quantum expectation value of the
energy-momentum tensor <T_ab> are isolated in the vacuum piece of <T_ab>, and
may be removed using adiabatic subtraction. The resulting renormalized <T_ab>
is conserved, independent of the cutoff, and has a physically transparent,
quasiclassical form in terms of the average number of created adiabatic
`particles'. By analyzing the evolution of the adiabatic particle number in de
Sitter spacetime we exhibit the time structure of the particle creation
process, which can be understood in terms of the time at which different
momentum scales enter the horizon. A numerical scheme to compute <T_ab> as a
function of time with arbitrary adiabatic initial states (not necessarily de
Sitter invariant) is described. For minimally coupled, massless fields, at late
times the renormalized <T_ab> goes asymptotically to the de Sitter invariant
state previously found by Allen and Folacci, and not to the zero mass limit of
the Bunch-Davies vacuum. If the mass m and the curvature coupling xi differ
from zero, but satisfy m^2+xi R=0, the energy density and pressure of the
scalar field grow linearly in cosmic time demonstrating that, at least in this
case, backreaction effects become significant and cannot be neglected in de
Sitter spacetime.

  For leading (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) calculations the simplest
choices, Q2, the virtuality of the incoming photon, and the mean squared
transverse momenta of the two jets ET2, are studied in different kinematic
regimes.
  It is found that only if both Q2 and ET2 are large, the NLO calculation is
stable with respect to numerical variations of muren while the LO calculation
strongly depends on it. If only one of the two scales, either Q2 or ET2, is
large, the NLO is more stable than the LO calculation, but exhibits
nevertheless a strong residual scale dependence.
  When both scales are relatively small, large scale dependencies are found in
both cases. Moreover, large differences between the LO and NLO calculation are
found.
  Generally, the use of ET2 as renormalisation scale is favoured over Q2, since
scale dependencies are less pronounced and NLO corrections are smaller.

where our 3-brane is located at the $Z_2$ symmetry fixed plane of a $Z_2$
symmetric five-dimensional spacetime, as in the Ho\v{r}ava-Witten model
compactified on a Calabi-Yau manifold. As our first result, we find that there
can be substantial modifications to the standard Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
(FRW) cosmology; as a consequence, a large class of such models is
observationally inconsistent. In particular, any relationship between the
Hubble constant and the energy density on our brane is possible, including (but
not only) FRW. Generically, due to the existence of the bulk and the boundary
conditions on the orbifold fixed plane, the relationship is not FRW, and hence
cosmological constraints coming from big bang nucleosynthesis, structure
formation, and the age of the universe difficult to satisfy. We do wish to
point out, however, that some specific choices for the bulk stress-energy
tensor components do reproduce normal FRW cosmology on our brane, and we have
constructed an explicit example. As our second result, for a broad class of
models, we find a somewhat surprising fact: the stabilization of the radius of
the extra dimension and hence the four dimensional Planck mass requires
unrealistic fine-tuning of the equation of state on our 3-brane. In the last
third of the paper, we make remarks about causality and the horizon problem
that apply to {\it any} theory in which the volume of the extra dimension
determines the four-dimensional gravitational coupling. We point out that some
of the assumptions that lead to the usual inflationary requirements are
modified.

chemical potential $\mu\neq 0$ is included, the analogy with a Coulomb gas
still holds with $\mu$ playing the role of a purely imaginary external electric
field. For small $T$ and $\mu$ we find a typical massive Fermi gas behaviour
for the fermion density, whereas for large $\mu$ it shows chiral restoration by
means of a vanishing effective fermion mass. Some similarities with the chiral
properties of low-energy QCD at finite $T$ and baryon chemical potential are
discussed.

questions about the class of algebras on which to define entire cyclic
cohomology. The right domain of definition for entire cyclic cohomology is the
category of complete bornological algebras. For these algebras, we define a
bivariant cohomology theory, called analytic cyclic cohomology, that contains
Connes's entire cyclic cohomology as a special case.
  The definition of analytic cyclic cohomology is based on the Cuntz-Quillen
approach to cyclic cohomology theories using tensor algebras and X-complexes.
The appropriate completion of the tensor algebra that yields analytic cyclic
cohomology can be understood using an appropriate notion of analytic
nilpotence.

  and an error has been corrected. Some material from the original version is
  in quant-ph/0112145, which is part II of the two-part paper",,,,"quant-ph",,"  A laser, be it an optical laser or an atom laser, is an open quantum system
that produces a coherent beam of bosons. Far above threshold, the stationary
state $\rho_{ss}$ of the laser mode is a mixture of coherent field states with
random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number states. This
paper answers the question: can descriptions such as these, of $\rho_{ss}$ as a
stationary ensemble of pure states, be physically realized? An ensemble of pure
states for a particular system can be physically realized if, without changing
the dynamics of the system, an experimenter can (in principle) know at any time
that the system is in one of the pure-state members of the ensemble. Such
knowledge can be obtained by monitoring the baths to which the system is
coupled, provided that coupling is describable by a Markovian master equation.
Using a family of master equations for the (atom) laser, we solve for the
physically realizable (PR) ensembles. We find that for any finite self-energy
$\chi$ of the bosons in the laser mode, the coherent state ensemble is not PR;
the closest one can come to it is an ensemble of squeezed states. This is
particularly relevant for atom lasers, where the self-energy arising from
elastic collisions is expected to be large. By contrast, the number state
ensemble is always PR. As $\chi$ increases, the states in the PR ensemble
closest to the coherent state ensemble become increasingly squeezed.
Nevertheless, there are values of $\chi$ for which states with well-defined
coherent amplitudes are PR, even though the atom laser is not coherent (in the
sense of having a Bose-degenerate output). We discuss the physical significance
of this anomaly in terms of conditional coherence (conditional Bose
degeneracy).

codes. In the first part we examine possible problem settings for quantum error
detection. Our goal is to derive a functional that describes the probability of
undetected error under natural physical assumptions concerning transmission
with error detection over the depolarizing channel. We discuss possible
transmission protocols with stabilizer and unrestricted quantum codes. The set
of results proved in Part I shows that in all the cases considered the average
probability of undetected error for a given code is essentially given by one
and the same function of its weight enumerators. This enables us to give a
consistent definition of the undetected error event.

exponential time dependence of the scale for the non-linear effects, the
correct measure-dependent probabilities can emerge via outcome counting,
without the addition of any stochastic fields or metaphysical hypotheses.

  extended version of our STOC paper containing the threshold result
  (quant-ph/9611025)",,,,"quant-ph",,"  This paper proves the threshold result, which asserts that quantum
computation can be made robust against errors and inaccuracies, when the error
rate, $\eta$, is smaller than a constant threshold, $\eta_c$. The result holds
for a very general, not necessarily probabilistic noise model, for quantum
particles with any number of states, and is also generalized to one dimensional
quantum computers with only nearest neighbor interactions. No measurements, or
classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. The
proceeding version was very succinct, and here we fill all the missing details,
and elaborate on many parts of the proof. In particular, we devote a section
for a discussion of universality issues and proofs that the sets of gates that
we use are universal. Another section is devoted to a rigorous proof that fault
tolerance can be achieved in the presence of general non probabilistic noise.
The systematic structure of the fault tolerant procedures for polynomial codes
is explained in length. The proof that the concatenation scheme works is
written in a clearer way. The paper also contains new and significantly simpler
proofs for most of the known results which we use. For example, we give a
simple proof that it suffices to correct bit and phase flips, we significantly
simplify Calderbank and Shor's original proof of the correctness of CSS codes.
We also give a simple proof of the fact that two-qubit gates are universal. The
paper thus provides a self contained and complete proof for universal fault
tolerant quantum computation.
