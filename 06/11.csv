Kato","The Origin of Diversity of Type Ia Supernovae and Environmental Effects","4 pages, 3 figures, Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/312213",,"astro-ph",,"  Observations suggest that the properties of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) may
depend on environmental characteristics, such as morphology, metallicity, and
age of host galaxies. The influence of these environmental properties on the
resulting SNe Ia is studied in this paper. First it is shown that the carbon
mass fraction X(C) in the C+O white dwarf SN Ia progenitors tends to be smaller
for lower metallicity and older the binary system age. It is then suggested
that the variation of X(C) causes the diversity in the brightness of SNe Ia: a
smaller X(C) leads to a dimmer SN Ia. Further studies of the propagation of the
turbulent flame are necessary to confirm this relation. Our model for the SN Ia
progenitors then predicts that when the progenitors belong to an older
population or to a low metallicity environment, the number of bright SNe Ia is
reduced, so that the variation in brightness among the SNe Ia is also smaller.
Thus our model can explain why the mean SN Ia brightness and its dispersion
depend on the morphology of the host galaxies and on the distance of the SN
from the center of the galaxy. It is further predicted that at higher redshift
(z >~ 1) both the the mean brightness of SNe Ia and its variation should be
smaller in spiral galaxies than in elliptical galaxies. These variations are
within the range observed in nearby SNe Ia. In so far as the variation in X(C)
is the most important cause for the diversity among SNe Ia, the light curve
shape method currently used to determine the absolute magnitude of SNe Ia can
be applied also to high redshift SNe Ia.

astrophysical systems. An outflow emanating from an accretion disk can act as a
sink for mass, angular momentum and energy and can therefore alter the
dissipation rates and effective temperatures across the disk. Here, the radial
distributions of dissipation rate and effective temperature across a Keplerian,
steady-state, mass-losing accretion disk are derived, using a simple,
parametric approach that is sufficiently general to be applicable to many types
of dynamical disk wind models.
  Effective temperature distributions for mass-losing accretion disks in
cataclysmic variables are shown explicitly, with parameters chosen to describe
both radiation-driven and centrifugally-driven outflows. For realistic wind
mass-loss rates of a few percent, only centrifugally-driven outflows --
particularly those in which mass loss is concentrated in the inner disk -- are
likely to alter the disk's effective temperature distribution significantly.
Accretion disks that drive such outflows could produce spectra and eclipse
light curves that are noticeably different from those produced by standard,
conservative disks.

at z>1, with a median redshift for the population of <z>~2-3. The
optical/near-infrared properties of the counterparts to the submm sources
breakdown as follows: roughly two-thirds have reliable identifications with the
others being more ambiguous. Of those with identifications about half are
optically bright (I<23) mergers or interactions with a high proportion showing
signatures of AGN activity and the other half are optically faint (I>25)

a population of distant, highly obscured ultraluminous infrared galaxies

properties of local ULIRGs. We suggest that the faint submm population

It has a flat rotation
curve in the inner regions, but the density falls off sharply beyond an outer
edge. This truncated, flat rotation curve (TF) model possesses a rich family of
simple distribution functions which vary in velocity anisotropy. The model is
used to estimate the total mass of the Milky Way halo using the latest data on
the motions of satellite galaxies and globular clusters at Galactocentric radii
greater than 20 kpc. This comprises a dataset of 27 objects with known
distances and radial velocities, of which 6 also possess measured proper
motions. Unlike earlier investigations, we find entirely consistent maximum
likelihood solutions unaffected by the presence or absence of Leo I, provided
both radial and proper motion data are used. The availability of the proper
motion data for the satellites is crucial as, without them, the mass estimates
with and without Leo I are inconsistent at the 99 % confidence level. All these
results are derived from models in which the velocity normalisation of the halo
potential is taken as 220 km/s. A detailed analysis of the uncertainties in our
estimate is presented, including the effects of the small dataset, possible
incompleteness or correlations in the satellite galaxy sample and the
measurement errors. The most serious uncertainties come from the size of the
dataset, which may cause a systematic underestimate by a factor of two, and the
measurement errors, which cause a scatter in the mass of the order of a factor
of two. We conclude that the total mass of the halo is 1.9 x 10^12 solar
masses, while the mass within 50 kpc is 5.4 x 10^11 solar masses. Future
prospects using radial velocity surveys of blue horizontal branch stars and

Alternatively lack of high frequency oscillations of the reflected component

very high angular resolution obtained at 86 GHz provides an upper limit to the
size of the core of 54 $\mu$as (0.025 $h^{-1}$pc). This represents a direct
determination of the base of the jet which is independent of variability
arguments (which depend on uncertain estimates of the Doppler factor), and
places it below approximately one light-month. Comparison with previous VLBA
observations after a one-year interval shows pronounced changes in the
structure and polarization of the jet. Most of the components are found to
follow a curved path while undergoing a steepening of their spectra accompanied
by a decrease in total and polarized emission. However, at least one component
is observed to follow a quasi-ballistic motion, accompanied by a flattening of
its spectrum, as well as an increase in total and polarized flux. This may be
explained by its interaction with the external medium, resulting in a shock
that enhances the emission and aligns the magnetic field perpendicular to the
component motion, thereby producing an increase of the degree of polarization
from undetected values to as high as 15%. A second strong component, with the
highest degree of polarization (23%), is found to have experienced a
displacement from the ridge line of the structural position angle of the jet as
it moved downstream. We have found a mean swing to the south of the position
angle of the innermost components of $\sim 6^{\circ}$ between late 1996 and
1997, which may be responsible for the jet curvature observed at parsec and

Hinich and Wolinsky has been surprisingly long-lived. Two factors have
prolonged this controversy. One factor is the presence of deep-seated
intuitions that such a test is fundamentally incoherent. Perhaps the most
compelling objection is that, given a set of discrete-time samples, one can
construct an unaliased continuous-time series which exactly fits those samples.
Therefore, the samples alone can not show that the original time series was
aliased. The second factor prolonging the debate has been an inability of its
proponents to unseat those objections. In fact, as is shown here, all
objections can be met and the test as stated is correct. In particular, the
role of stationarity as knowledge in addition to the sample values turns out to
be crucial. Under certain conditions, including those addressed by the
bispectral aliasing test, the continuous-time signals reconstructed from
aliased samples are non-stationary. Therefore detecting aliasing in (at least
some) stationary continuous-time processes both makes sense and can be done.
The merits of the bispectral test for practical use are briefly addressed, but
our primary concern here is its theoretical soundness.

achieve that by formally rewriting the problem in terms of a fictitious

superconductor (SC) devices is the presence of trapped flux. Flux lines or
vortices are induced by fields as small as the Earth's magnetic field. Once
present, vortices dissipate energy and generate internal noise, limiting the
operation of numerous superconducting devices. Methods used to overcome this
difficulty include the pinning of vortices by the incorporation of impurities
and defects, the construction of flux dams, slots and holes and magnetic
shields which block the penetration of new flux lines in the bulk of the SC or
reduce the magnetic field in the immediate vicinity of the superconducting
device. Naturally, the most desirable would be to remove the vortices from the
bulk of the SC. There is no known phenomenon, however, that could form the
basis for such a process. Here we show that the application of an ac current to
a SC that is patterned with an asymmetric pinning potential can induce vortex
motion whose direction is determined only by the asymmetry of the pattern. The
mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is the so called ratchet effect, and

extended by including both structural and magnetic degrees of freedom in order
to elucidate premartensitic effects. Special attention is paied to the effect
of the magnetoelastic coupling in Ni2MnGa. The microscopic model is constructed
and justified based on the analysis of the experimentally observed strain
variables and precursor phenomena. The description includes the (local)
tetragonal distortion, the amplitude of the plane-modulating strain, and the
magnetization. The model is solved by means of mean-field theory and Monte
Carlo simulations. The results show that a variety of premartensitic effects
may appear due to the magnetoelastic coupling. For large values of the
magnetoelastic coupling parameter we find a premartensitic first-order
transition line ending in a critical point. This critical point is responsible
for the existence of large premartensitic fluctuations which manifest as broad
peaks in the specific heat, not always associated with a true phase transition.
The main conclusion is that premartensitic effects result from the interplay
between the softness of the anomalous phonon driving the modulation and the
magnetoelastic coupling. In particular, the premartensitic transition occurs
when such coupling is strong enough to freeze the involved mode phonon.

of flavors $N_F(Q^2/m^2)$ in the $\alpha_V$ scheme is determined as a

relations then provide the next-to-leading order connection between all
perturbatively calculable observables to the analytic and gauge-invariant
$\alpha_V$ scheme without any scale ambiguity and a well defined number of
active flavors. The inclusion of the finite quark mass effects in the running

positive characteristic case, we obtain some remarkable resolutions of the
contragradient modules over the small quantum group. We use these resolutions
to calculate semiinfinite cohomology of the small quantum group with
coefficients in contragradient Weyl modules. It turns out that the described
graded space of semiinfinite cohomology is naturally isomorphic to the space of
distributions on the cotangent bundle of the flag variety with support in the
union of conormal bundles to the Schubert cells with coefficients in the
pull-back of a line bundle on the flag variety.

dilation of $L(\lambda)$ of a particular form. Generalized resolvents exist on
every open set $U$, with $\bar{U}$ included in the regular domain of $T$. This
implies a formula for the maximal radius of regularity of $T$ in terms of the
spectral radius of its generalized inverses. A solution to an open problem

result due to G. Corach and A. Larotonda. Using some results due to M. Karoubi,
we show the isomorphism of the Witt group of a symmetric Banach algebra with
the $K_0$-group of its enveloping $C^*$-algebra. The question if this is true
for all involutive Banach algebras was raised by A. Connes.

3-manifold, the space of all incompressible surfaces in a single isotopy class
is contractible, except when the surface is the fiber of a surface bundle
structure, in which case the space of all surfaces isotopic to the fiber has
the homotopy type of a circle (the fibers). The main application from the 1976
paper is also rederived, the theorem (proved independently by Ivanov) that the
diffeomorphism group of a Haken 3-manifold has contractible components, except
in the case of certain Seifert manifolds when the components of the
diffeomorphism group have the homotopy type of a circle or torus acting on the
manifold.

Similarity Renormalization Group, to solve simple Schr{\""o}dinger equations
with delta-function potentials in one and two dimensions. The familiar
one-dimensional delta-function does not require renormalization, but it
provides the simplest example of a local interaction that can be replaced by a
sequence of effective cutoff interactions that produce controllable power-law
errors. The two-dimensional delta-function leads to logarithmic divergences,
dimensional transmutation and asymptotic freedom, providing an example of some
of the most important renormalization problems in gauge field theories. We
concentrate on the power-law analysis of errors in low-energy observables. The
power-law suppression of the effects of irrelevant operators is critical to the
success of field theory, and understanding them turns renormalization group
techniques into powerful predictive tools for complicated problems where exact
solutions are not available.

operators involved in the calculations so that these two different sequences
lead to the same observable results. These conditions are similar to the
equal-time commutation relations in quantum field theory. They are sufficient
to prevent superluminal signaling. (The derivation of these results does not

where the degree of overlapping determines the statistics that particles should
obey among continuous generalized statistics. We present an example consistent
with the conjecture.
