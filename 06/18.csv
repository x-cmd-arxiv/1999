shows rapid variability, but no evidence for energy-dependence to these
variations, within the 0.6 -- 10 keV bandpass. A strong (EW ~ 70 eV) spectral
feature is observed close to 1 keV. A similar feature has been observed in TON
S180 (another NLSy1) but has not been observed in broad-line Seyfert galaxies.
The feature energy suggests a large contribution from Fe L-shell lines but its
intensity is difficult to explain in terms of emission and/or absorption from
photoionized gas. Models based on gas in thermal equilibrium with kT ~1 keV
provide an alternative parameterization of the soft spectrum. The latter may be
interpreted as the hot intercloud medium, undergoing rapid cooling and
producing strong Fe L-shell recombination lines. In all cases the physical
conditions are rather different from those observed in broad-line Seyferts. The
hard X-ray spectrum shows a broad and asymmetric Fe Kalpha line of large
equivalent width (~550 eV) which can be explained by a neutral disk viewed at ~
60 degrees to the line-of-sight, contrary to the hypothesis that NLSy1s are
viewed pole-on. The large EW of this line, the strong 1 keV emission and the
strong optical Fe emission lines all suggest an extreme Fe abundance in this

gravitational perturbation theory with the Edgeworth expansion around a
Gaussian PDF. Despite the remarkable success of the Edgeworth expansion in
modeling the weakly non-linear growth of fluctuations around the peak of the
cosmic PDF, it fails to reproduce the expected behaviour in the tails of the
distribution. Besides, this expansion is ill-defined as it predicts negative
densities and negative probabilities for the cosmic fields. This is a natural
consequence of using an expansion around the Gaussian distribution, which is
not rigorously well-defined when describing a positive variate, such as the
density field. Here we present an alternative to the Edgeworth series based on
an expansion around the Gamma PDF. The Gamma expansion is designed to converge
when the PDF exhibits exponential tails. The proposed expansion is better
suited for describing a real PDF as it always yields positive densities and the
PDF is effectively positive-definite. We compare the performance of the
Edgeworth and the Gamma expansions for a wide dynamical range making use of
cosmological N-body simulations and assess their range of validity. In general,
the Gamma expansion provides an interesting and simple alternative to the
Edgeworth series and it should be useful for modeling non-gaussian PDFs in
other contexts, such as in the cosmic microwave background.

(LiBeB), associated with the evolution of a superbubble (SB) blown by repeated
SNe in an OB association. It is shown that if about ten percent of the SN
energy can power the acceleration of particles from the material inside the SB,
the observed abundances of LiBeB in halo stars, as a function of O, can be
explained in a fully consistent way over several decades of metallicity. In
this model, the energetic particles (EPs) reflect the SB material, which is a
mixing of the ejecta of previous SNe and of the swept-up ISM gas evaporated off
the shell. We investigated two different energy spectra for the EPs: the
standard cosmic ray source spectrum, or `SNR spectrum', and a specific `SB
spectrum', as results from the SB acceleration mechanism of Bykov & Fleishman
(1992). While the latter spectrum is more efficient in producing LiBeB, the SNR
spectrum can be reconciled with the observational data if an imperfect mixing
of the SN ejecta with the rest of the SB material and/or a selective
acceleration is invoked (enhancing the C and O abundance amongst the EPs by a
factor of ~ 6). One of the main consequences of our model is that the observed
linear growth of Be and B abundances as a function of Fe/H expresses a dilution
line rather than a continuous, monotonic increase of the metallicity. We
propose an observational test of this feature. We also show that the recent 6Li
observations in halo stars fit equally well in the framework of the SB model.
Finally, we conjecture the existence of two sets of low-metallicity stars,
differing in their Be/Fe or B/O abundance ratios, resulting from a `bimodal'
LiBeB production in the Galaxy, namely from correlated (in SBs) or isolated SN

tau(age) approx 4+/-1 Myr for the Quintuplet. We estimate total cluster masses
by adding the masses of observed stars down to the 50% completeness limit, and
then extrapolating down to a lower mass cutoff of 1 Msun. Using this method, we

for the Quintuplet cluster is complicated by the double-valued mass-magnitude

forming a coronal flow and (3) standard disk evolution leading to outburst
cycles by accretion disk instability (dwarf nova mechanism).
  We investigate the evolution of accretion disks during quiescence including
the evaporation of gas in the inner part of the disk. About 20% of the matter
is lost in a wind from the corona. The mass flow rate obtained from our model
for the coronal flow towards the black hole, is about half of the matter
flowing over from the companion star. It agrees with the rate independently
derived from the ADAF spectral fits by Narayan et al. (1997). About one third
of the matter accumulates in the outer cool disk. The computed disk evolution
is consistent with the observational data from the outburst in 1975. The
evolution of the accretion disk until the instability is reached shows that the
critical surface density can not be reached for rates only slightly less than
the rate derived here for A0620-00. Systems with such accretion rates would be
globally stable, suggesting that many such faint permanently quiescent black

the luminosity fluctuations were unambiguously detected, yielding a density of
2 - 10 red giants/pixel. Using the observed B-V and V-I colors as a constraint,
we could find no model that would reproduce the observed fluctuation signal and
blue colors if there was a significant population of M-giants in these systems.
The third system, V2L8, did not have a detectable fluctuation signal which
possibly implies it is not in the Virgo cluster. Interestingly, this system is
highly nucleated. Our observations have resolved this nucleus and if V2L8 is in
Virgo, then we have discovered what is likely the smallest bulge measured to
date, having an effective radius of only 50 pc. This bulge is quite red (as red
as giant ellipticals) and its entirely possible that this nucleated dE galaxy,
in fact, is a very large galaxy located in the background. As such, it is
highly reminiscent of the manner in which Malin-1 was discovered. Finally, we
find no evidence for small scale clumping of stars in any of the studied
systems at this much improved spatial resolution. This implies these systems
are dynamically well-relaxed and that the physical cause of their observed low
surface brightnesses is their low density. When imaged at the high spatial

burst of either star formation activity or the fuelling of an active galactic
nucleus (AGN). The models are well constrained by the observed spectrum of the
FIR/submm background radiation and the 60-micron counts of low-z IRAS galaxies.
The ratio between the total amount of energy released during mergers and the
mass of dark matter involved must increase sharply with z at z<1, and then
decrease at higher z, independent of the fraction of the luminosity of mergers
that is produced by starbursts and AGN. One additional parameter - the
reciprocal of the product of the duration of the enhanced luminosity produced
by the merger and the fraction of mergers that induce an enhanced luminosity,
which we call the activity parameter - is introduced, to allow the relationship
between merging dark matter haloes and the observed counts of distant dusty
galaxies to be investigated. The observed counts can only be reproduced if the
activity parameter is greater by a factor of about 5 and 100 at redshifts of 1
and 3 respectively, compared with the present epoch. Hence, if mergers account
for the SCUBA galaxies, then the merger process must have been much more

combined with a specific density dependence of effective neutron-proton

medium at densities exceeding four times normal nuclear matter density. We
study consequences of the localization of protons for transport processes in
dense neutron star cores, assuming random distribution of proton impurities.
Kinetic equations, relevant for the transport of charge, heat and momentum, are
solved using variational method. Localization of protons removes a T^{-2}
factor from the transport coefficients, which leads, at lower temperatures, to
a strong decrease of thermal conductivity, electrical conductivity and shear
viscosity of neutron star matter, as compared to the standard case, where
protons form a Fermi liquid. Due to the localization of protons a number of
conventional neutrino emission processes (including modified URCA process)
become inoperative in neutron star cores. On the other hand, the energy loss
rate from neutrino-antineutrino pair bremsstrahlung due to electron and neutron
scattering off (localized) protons, will have a specific T^6 dependence, which
could modify the cooling of the neutron star core, as compared to the standard
case. Possible astrophysical implications of the localization of protons for
neutron star evolution and dynamics are discussed.

disappears. This temperature dependence is similar to that of the superfluid
density in the BCS theory of superconductivity. More precisely, it is the same
as the temperature dependence of the Fr\""ohlich condensate density of a regular
CDW/SDW. This suggests a two-fluid picture of the quantum Hall effect, where
the Hall conductivity of the condensate is quantized, but the condensate

all three components of the resistivity tensor simultaneously on a

In the case of growth from a condensed phase, the most frequent ones are
diffusion instabilities, which will be but briefly discussed in simple terms in
chapter II. The present review is mainly devoted to instabilities which arise
in ballistic growth, especially Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE). The reasons of
the instabilities can be geometric (shadowing effect), but they are mostly
kinetic or thermodynamic. The kinetic instabilities which will be studied in
detail in chapters IV and V result from the fact that adatoms diffusing on a
surface do not easily cross steps (Ehrlich-Schwoebel or ES effect). When the
growth front is a high symmetry surface, the ES effect produces mounds which
often coarsen in time according to power laws. When the growth front is a
stepped surface, the ES effect initially produces a meandering of the steps,
which eventually may also give rise to mounds. Kinetic instabilities can
usually be avoided by raising the temperature, but this favours thermodynamic
instabilities. Concerning these ones, the attention will be focussed on the
instabilities resulting from slightly different lattice constants of the
substrate and the adsorbate. They can take the following forms. i) Formation of
misfit dislocations (chapter VIII). ii) Formation of isolated epitaxial
clusters which, at least in their earliest form, are `coherent' with the
substrate, i.e. dislocation-free (chapter X). iii) Wavy deformation of the
surface, which is presumably the incipient stage of (ii) (chapter IX). The
theories and the experiments are critically reviewed and their comparison is
qualitatively satisfactory although some important questions have not yet
received a complete answer.

covariant gauge is discussed. The Dirac procedure is used to eliminate the
constraints in the gauge-fixed front form theory quantum action and to
construct the LF Hamiltonian formulation. The physical degrees of freedom
emerge naturally. The propagator of the dynamical $\psi_+$ part of the free
fermionic propagator in the LF quantized field theory is shown to be causal and
not to contain instantaneous terms. Since the relevant propagators in the
covariant gauge formulation are causal, rotational invariance---including the
Coulomb potential in the static limit---can be recovered, avoiding the
difficulties encountered in light-cone gauge. The Wick rotation may also be
performed allowing the conversion of momentum space integrals into Euclidean
space forms. Some explicit computations are done in quantum electrodynamics to
illustrate the equivalence of front form theory with the conventional covariant
formulation. LF quantization thus provides a consistent formulation of gauge
theory, despite the fact that the hyperplanes $x^{\pm}=0$ used to impose
boundary conditions constitute characteristic surfaces of a hyperbolic partial

U(1) gauge superfields that couple to heavy chiral matter is studied. We
calculate the one-loop corrected effective Lagrangians that involve light

by equations of motion leads to decoupling effects with terms that grow
logarithmically with M. These corrections renormalize light fields and
couplings in the theory (in accordance with the ""decoupling theorem""). When the

superstring theory, where the couplings are calculable, such decoupling effects
modify the low-energy predictions for the effective couplings of light fields.
In particular, for the class of string vacua with an ""anomalous"" U(1) the
vacuum restabilization triggers the decoupling effects, which can significantly
modify the low energy predictions for the couplings of the surviving light

first-passage percolation model. We use the Charlier ensemble to investigate
the asymptotics of weakly increasing subsequences in random words and to prove

Plancherel measure, the distribution of the lengths of the first k rows in the
partition, appropriately scaled, converges to the asymptotic joint distribution
for the k largest eigenvalues of a random matrix from the Gaussian Unitary

checked the reliability and accuracy of a forecasting model based on concepts

embedding phase space, Lyapunov spectrum, chaotic behaviour. The model is based
on a local hypothesis of the behaviour on the embedding space, utilizing an
optimal number k of neighbour vectors to predict the future evolution of the
current point with the set of characteristic parameters determined by several
previous parametric computations. The performances of this method suggest its
valuable insertion in the set of the so-called statistical-numerical prediction

involving type II and type I parametric downconversion, and triggering
photodetectors. The state generated by the proposed experimental set-up can be
reconstructed through multi-mode quantum homodyne tomography. The feasibility
of the measurement is studied on the basis of Monte-Carlo simulations.

A261 (1999) 44-50","10.1016/S0375-9601(99)00569-1",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider a driven 2-level system with one level showing spontaneous decay
to an otherwise uncoupled third level. Rabi transitions to the unstable level
are strongly damped. This simple configuration can be used to demonstrate and
to explore the quantum Zeno effect leading to a freezing of the system to the
initial level. A comparison with repeated projection measurements is given. A
treatment within a phenomenological theory of continuous measurements is
sketched. The system visualizes the important role of null measurements
(negative result measurements) and may serve as a good example for a truly
continuous measurement.

electromagnetic field is considered. It is demonstrated that radiative decay in
such a system resulting from photon exchange gives rise to a definite amount of
information related to interatomic communication. Joint distributions of
detection probabilities of atomic quanta and the corresponding amount of
communication information are calculated.
