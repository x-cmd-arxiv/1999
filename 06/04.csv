out that the Minimum Description Length principle provides an approach to

absolute magnitudes (M_V = 15.72; M_bol = 16.2) put it among the least-luminous
white dwarfs known. Its optical spectrum shows no features, indicating it has a
DC classification, and it shows no detectable polarization, indicating it does
not have a very strong magnetic field. However, its broadband colors show it to
have a unique spectral energy distribution, and it stands out from all other
stars in BVI and other broadband photometric surveys.
  We discuss these properties, and conclude that LHS 3250 must be an extremely
cool white dwarf with strong collision-induced absorption at red-infrared
wavelengths from molecular hydrogen, in accord with models for very cool white
dwarf atmospheres. If so, it is the first such star known, and the first star
to provide observational evidence supporting these models. It suggests that
other very cool white dwarfs, both halo white dwarfs and the oldest disk white
dwarfs, also may have colors affected by similar absorption. The atmospheric
composition of LHS 3250 is not known, and therefore its temperature is poorly
determined. It may be a helium-core star with a mass 0.3-0.45 M_solar and a
product of mass-transfer in a close binary system. However, until its
temperature is better known, its mass and age remain uncertain.

gravity, where a scalar field $\phi$, assumed to provide most of the cosmic
energy density today, is non-minimally coupled to the Ricci curvature scalar
$R$. Such `Extended Quintessence' cosmologies have the appealing feature that
the same field causing the time (and space) variation of the cosmological
constant is the source of a varying Newton's constant \`a la
Jordan-Brans-Dicke. We investigate here two classes of models, where the
gravitational sector of the Lagrangian is $F(\phi)R$ with $F(\phi
)=\xi\phi^{2}$ (Induced Gravity, IG) and $F(\phi)=1+\xi\phi^{2}$ (Non-Minimal
Coupling, NMC). As a first application of this idea we consider a specific
model, where the Quintessence field, $\phi$, obeying the simplest inverse power
potential, has $\Omega_{\phi}=0.6$ today, in the context of the Cold Dark
Matter scenario, with scale-invariant adiabatic initial perturbations. We find
that, if $\xi\lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$ for IG and $\xi\lesssim 5\times
10^{-3}(\sqrt{G}\phi_{0})^{-1}$ for NMC ($\phi_{0}$ is the present Quintessence
value) our Quintessence field satisfies the existing solar system experimental
constraints. Using linear perturbation theory we then obtain the polarization
and temperature anisotropy spectra of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) as
well as the matter power-spectrum. The perturbation behavior possesses
distinctive features, that we name `QR-effects', regarding acoustic peak
location and height, late time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, as well as
turnover and amplitude in the matter power spectrum. These features could be
detected in the upcoming observations on CMB and large-scale structure.

shock containing most of the ejecta and a relativistic shock (Gamma=2) which is
responsible for the radio emission. This is the first evidence for the
existence of relativistic shocks in supernovae. It is quite plausible that this
shock may produce high energy emission (at early times and by inverse Compton
scattering). As with other supernovae, we expect radio emission at much later
times powered primarily by the slow moving ejecta. This expectation has
motivated us to continue monitoring this unusual SN.

interaction between supernova-powered gas outflows from low-mass galaxies and
the local intergalactic medium (IGM). We are specifically interested in
investigating whether a high pressure IGM, such as that in clusters of
galaxies, can prevent the gas from escaping from the galaxy. The interface
between the outflow and ambient IGM is demarcated by a dense expanding shell
formed by the gas swept-up by the outflow. A sufficiently high IGM pressure can
bring the shell to a halt well before it escapes the galaxy. Galaxies in such
high pressure environments are, however, to be ploughing through the IGM at
relatively high velocities. Hence, they will also be subject to ram pressure,
which acts to strip the gas from the galaxy. We have carried out simulations
that take into account the combined impact of ram pressure and thermal
pressure. We find that ram pressure deforms the shell into a tail-like
structure, fragments it into dense clouds and eventually drags the clouds away
from the galaxy. The clouds are potential sites of star formation and if viewed
during this transient phase, the galaxy will appear to have a low-surface
brightness tail much like the galaxies with diffuse comet-like tail seen in
z=1.15 cluster 3C324. In contrast, the relatively unhindered outflows in low
density, low temperature environments can drive the shells of swept-up gas out
to large distances from the galaxy. Such shells, if they intersect a quasar
line-of-sight, would give rise to Ly $\alpha$ absorption lines of the kind seen
in quasar spectra.

  MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.03041.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent results from a number of redshift surveys suggest that the Universe is
well described by an inhomogeneous, fractal distribution on the largest scales
probed. This distribution has been found to have fractal dimension, D,
approximately equal to 2.1, in contrast to a homogeneous distribution in which
the dimension should approach the value 3 as the scale is increased. In this
paper we demonstrate that estimates of D, based on the conditional density of
galaxies, are prone to bias from several sources. These biases generally result
in a smaller measured fractal dimension than the true dimension of the sample.
We illustrate this behaviour in application to the Stromlo-APM redshift survey,
showing that this dataset in fact provides evidence for fractal dimension
increasing with survey depth. On the largest scale probed, r approximately 60
h^{-1}Mpc, we find evidence for a distribution with dimension D = 2.76 +/-
0.10. A comparison between this sample and mock Stromlo-APM catalogues taken
from Nbody simulations (which assume a CDM cosmology) reveals a striking
similarity in the behaviour of the fractal dimension. Thus we find no evidence
for inhomogeneity in excess of that expected from conventional cosmological
theory. We consider biases affecting future large surveys and demonstrate,
using mock SDSS catalogues, that this survey will be able to measure the
fractal dimension on scales at which we expect to see full turn-over to
homogeneity, in an accurate and unbiased way.

to be a powerful tool for investigating the age and the metallicity of these
systems. When computing models for spectrophotometric narrow-band indices,
index calibrations as functions of the relevant stellar parameters (e.g.
temperature, gravity and metal content) are used. Thus synthetic indices depend
upon these calibrations (called fitting functions), as well as on the stellar
evolution ingredients adopted. All these inputs suffer from uncertainties,
which impact on the derived value for the indices. In this paper we address
this problem quantitatively. We compute synthetic Mg2, Fe5270, Fe5335 and Hbeta
indices for Simple Stellar Populations (SSP) of various ages and metallicities,
under different prescriptions for the fitting functions. This allows us to
estimate the impact of the uncertainties in the fitting functions. By comparing
our models to those of other authors computed with the same fitting functions,
we estimate the uncertainty associated to the use of different stellar
evolution prescriptions. It is found that the modelling of the Horizontal
Branch impacts particularly on <Fe> and Hbeta. In the range of parameters
explored, the uncertainties introduced by the use of different fitting
functions can be appreciably larger than the error affecting the observational
data. This typically occurs at high Z for the metallic line strengths, at low Z
for the Hbeta index.

provides direct evidence for a charge disproportionated electronic

distribution on each rung, without any long range order. We show that, because
of the locally broken symmetry, spin-flip excitations carry a finite electric

optical absorption processes for E parallel to the a axis. The charged-magnon

progressing from M=La to U the system undergoes a metal-insulator transition.
It is shown that, although the filling atom induces such dramatic changes in
the transport properties of the system, it has only a small effect on lattice
dynamics. We discuss this property of the compounds in the context of their
possible thermoelectric applications.

(BAU) provided the typical scale of the knot is larger than the diffusivity
length scale. We derive constraints on the primordial hypermagnetic flux
required by our mechanism and we provide a measure of the parity breaking by
connecting the degree of knottedness of the flux lines to the BAU. We rule out
the ordinary axion as a possible candidate for production (around temperatures
of the order of the GeV) of {\em magnetic} knots since the produced {\em
electromagnetic} helicity is negligible (for cosmological standard) if the
initial amplitude of the axion oscillations is of the order of the Peccei-Quinn
breaking scale.

quark productions and their decay at polarized e^+e^- linear colliders. For the
analyses of the spin-spin correlations in top quark production, we introduce a
generic spin basis and show which spin basis is the most optimal. We discuss
the spin-angular correlations for the top quark decay, and demonstrate that the
directions of electro-weak decay products of polarized top quarks are strongly
correlated to the top quark spin. We also explain how to measure the top quark
spin using decay products. The spin correlations using the generic spin basis
are extensively studied at the next to leading order of QCD for top quark
productions at e^+e^- colliders. The radiative corrections induce an anomalous
\gamma/Z magnetic moment for the top quarks and allow for real gluon emissions.
Therefore they might change the leading order analyses. We show that higher
order effects on the top quark spin orientation are very small. The final
results are that the top (or anti-top) quarks are produced in an essentially
unique spin configuration for a particular spin basis even after including the
{\cal O}(\alpha_{s}) QCD corrections. Our results imply that measuring the spin
correlation for top quarks is very promising to reveal new aspects of the
Standard Model, as well as new physics beyond the Standard Model.

finite kinematical boundaries into account. In an expansion in powers of the
opacity of the medium, we derive explicit expressions for the radiation cross
section associated with N=1, 2 and 3 scatterings. We verify the Bethe-Heitler
and the factorization limit, and we calculate corrections to the factorization
limit proportional to the square of the target size. A closed form expression
valid to arbitrary orders in the opacity is derived in the dipole
approximation. The resulting radiation spectrum is non-analytic in the coupling
constant which is traced back to the transverse momentum broadening of a hard
parton undergoing multiple small angle Moliere scattering. In extending the
results to QCD, we test a previously used dipole prescription by comparing to
direct pQCD results for N=1 and 2. For N=1, the QCD dipole prescription
reproduces exactly the Bertsch-Gunion radiation spectrum. For N=2, we find a
sizeable correction which reduces to a multiplicative factor 17/8 at large
separation.

the discrete symmetry. In the former case, it is shown that after elimination
of the gauge degrees of freedom from the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics the
resulting unconstrained system represents the ID_3 Euler-Calogero-Moser model
with an external fourth-order potential. Whereas in the latter, the IA_6
Euler-Calogero-Moser model embedded in an external potential is derived whose
projection onto the invariant submanifold through the discrete symmetry
coincides again with the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics. Based on this connection,
the equations of motion of the SU(2) Yang-Mills mechanics in the limit of the
zero coupling constant are presented in the Lax form.

  LaTeX (BibTeX)",,,,"hep-th hep-ph",,"  The mechanism of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking is studied in the Abelian
version of the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in four dimensions. The most
interesting feature of the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is the appearance of
relevant (renormalizable) four-fermion interactions near a critical curve
separating a chiral symmetric and a dynamically chiral symmetry broken phase.
The first three chapters of the thesis are introductory. Chapter 4 is based on
hep-th/9712123. In an attempt to go beyond standard mean field approximations
for four-fermion interactions, the 1/N expansion is utilized in chapter 5.
Within the 1/N expansion, where N is the number of fermion flavors, it is shown
that the renormalization group beta function of the U(1) gauge coupling has
ultra-violet stable fixed points for sufficiently large N. This implies that
the gauged Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model is a rare example of a nontrivial
nonasymptotically free gauge field theory in four dimensions.

gravity. The model is applicable for center of mass energies higher than the
relevant Planck scale. At impact parameters smaller than the Schwarzchild
radius appropriate to the center of mass energy and total charge of the initial
state, the cross section is dominated by an inelastic process in which a single
large black hole is formed. The black hole then decays by Hawking radiation.
The elastic cross section is highly suppressed at these impact parameters
because of the small phase space for thermal decay into a high energy two body
state. For very large impact parameter the amplitude is dominated by
eikonalized single graviton exchange. At intermediate impact parameters the
scattering is more complicated, but since the Schwarzchild radius grows with
energy, we speculate that a more sophisticated eikonal calculation which uses
the nonlinear classical solutions of the field equations may provide a good
approximation at all larger impact parameters. We discuss the extent to which
black hole production will be observable in theories with low scale quantum

that there are three, seven, twenty eight and twelve inequivalent classes of

compared to existing group classifications of nonlinear heat conductivity
equations and one of the conclusions is that all of them can be obtained within

part of this talk will focus on radiation pion effects, which first appear at
NNLO. The power counting for radiation pions is simple for center of mass
momentum p~\sqrt{M m_pi}=Q_r, the threshold for pion production. We explain how
graphs calculated with the Q_r power counting scale for p~m_\pi. The Q_r^3
radiation pion contributions to nucleon-nucleon scattering are suppressed by
inverse powers of the S-wave scattering lengths. However, we point out that
order Q_r^4 radiation contributions might give a NNLO contribution for p~m_pi.
In the second part of the talk, results for the potential pion and contact
interaction part of the NNLO 1S0 phase shift are presented. We emphasize the
importance of eliminating spurious poles in the expression for the amplitude at
each order in the perturbative expansion. Doing this leaves a total of three
free parameters at NNLO. We obtain a good fit to the 1S0 phase shift.

-6x10^{-11}Hz^{-1}] corresponds to anegative group velocity V_g ~= -c/23000.

peakon-antipeakon solutions of the Camassa-Holm equation. The closed form
solution is expressed in terms of the orthogonal polynomials of the related
classical moment problem. It is shown that collisions occur only in
peakon-antipeakon pairs, and the details of the collisions are analyzed using
results {}from the moment problem. A sharp result on the steepening of the
slope at the time of collision is given. Asymptotic formulas are given, and the
scattering shifts are calculated explicitly

relevant KdV equation was fitted to the initial data, and good agreement was
maintained throughout the entire interaction. The data demonstrates that the
soliton interactions are virtually elastic
