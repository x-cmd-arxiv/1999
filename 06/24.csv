of wavelet coefficients dominated by instrumental noise. CMB maps with a

Faber-Jackson (F-J) relation, and find that a galaxy's position relative to
this relation depends on its age. We attempt to reproduce the observed trend of
the F-J residuals with age using two simple models. The first assumes that
galaxy age is tracing the last major star formation event in an elliptical
galaxy. The fading of this burst changes the M_B component of the F-J
residuals, with time. Such a model was very successful at reproducing the B-V
and Mg_2 evolution reported in our previous paper, but is unable to reproduce
the strength of the F-J trend. A second model is required to describe
age-correlated changes in galaxy dynamics. Following expectations from
cosmological simulations, we assume that the velocity dispersion, for a galaxy
of a given mass, scales with the epoch of galaxy formation, i.e. with the mean
density of the Universe. Hence recently formed ellipticals have systematically
lower velocity dispersions than old ellipticals. We find that a combination of
these two models provides a good match to the change in F-J residuals with
galaxy age. This suggests that young ellipticals will have subtly different
dynamical properties to old ellipticals. We also find that there is not a
strong relationship between a galaxy's age and its luminosity for our sample.
This suggests that the tilt of the fundamental plane is not totally driven by
age.

coincident with the young, energetic radio pulsars PSRs B1046-58 and
J1105-6107, respectively. We find evidence for an association between PSR
B1046-58 and 2EG J1049-5847. The gamma-ray pulse profile, obtained by folding
time-tagged photons having energies above 400 MeV using contemporaneous radio
ephemerides, has probability of arising by chance of 1.2E-4 according to the
binning-independent H-test. A spatial analysis of the on-pulse photons reveals
a point source of equivalent significance 10.2 sigma. Off-pulse, the
significance drops to 5.8 sigma. Archival ASCA data show that the only hard
X-ray point source in the 95% confidence error box of the gamma-ray source is
spatially coincident with the pulsar within the 1' uncertainty (Pivovaroff,
Kaspi & Gotthelf 1999). The double peaked gamma-ray pulse morphology and
leading radio pulse are similar to those seen for other gamma-ray pulsars and
are well-explained in models in which the gamma-ray emission is produced in
charge-depleted gaps in the outer magnetosphere. The inferred pulsed gamma-ray
flux above 400 MeV, (2.5 +/- 0.6) x 10E-10 erg/cm^2/s, represents 0.011 +/-
0.003 of the pulsar's spin-down luminosity, for a distance of 3 kpc and 1 sr

using contemporaneous radio ephemerides show no significant features. We
conclude that this pulsar converts less than 0.014 of its spin-down luminosity
into E > 100 MeV gamma-rays beaming in our direction (99% confidence), assuming
a distance of 7 kpc, 1 sr beaming and a duty cycle of 0.5.

B1046-58 and B1610-50, and their surroundings, using archival data from the
Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA).
  The energetic pulsar PSR B1046-58 is detected in X-rays with a significance
of 4.5 sigma. The unabsorbed flux, estimated assuming a power-law spectrum and
a neutral hydrogen column density N_H of 5E21 cm^-2 is (2.5 +/- 0.3) x 10E-13
ergs/cm^2/s in the 2-10 keV band. Pulsed emission is not detected; the pulsed
fraction is less than 31% at the 90% confidence level for a 50% duty cycle. We
argue that the emission is best explained as originating from a pulsar-powered
synchrotron nebula. The X-ray counterpart of the pulsar is the only hard source
within the 95% error region of the previously unidentified gamma-ray source 3EG
J1048-5840. This evidence supports the results of Kaspi et al. (1999), who in a
companion paper, suggest that PSR B1046-58 is the counterpart to 3EG
J1048-5840.
  X-ray emission from PSR B1610-50 is not detected. Using similar assumptions
as above, the derived 3 sigma upper limit for the unabsorbed 2-10 keV X-ray
flux is 1.5E-13 ergs/cm^2/s. We use the flux limit to estimate the pulsar's
velocity to be less than ~170 km/s, casting doubt on a previously reported
association between PSR B1610-50 and supernova remnant Kes 32. Kes 32 is
detected, as is evident from the correlation between X-ray and radio emission.
The ASCA images of PSR B1610-50 are dominated by mirror-scattered emission from
the X-ray-bright supernova remnant RCW 103, located 33' away.
  We find no evidence for extended emission around either pulsar, in contrast
to previous reports of large nebulae surrounding both pulsars.

spatial correlation function obeys a power law with the power index $\gamma =
2\epsilon -3$ in the strongly non-linear regime. We find the form of the
two-point spatial correlation function, which does not obey the power law when
the power index $\epsilon$ is smaller than 3/2, such as the density profile
$\rho \propto r^{-1}$ around the center of the halo which is proposed by
Navarro, Frenk & White (1996,1997). By using the BBGKY equation in the strongly
non-linear regime, it is also found that velocity parameter $h \equiv - < v > /
\dot{a}x$ is not a constant even in the strongly non-linear regime ($\tilde{x}
\equiv x/x_{nl} \to 0$) although it is a constant when $\epsilon > 3/2$ and
then the two-point spatial correlation function can be regarded as the power
law. The velocity parameter $h$ becomes 0 at the non-linear limit of $\tilde{x}
\to 0$, that is, the stable clustering hypothesis cannot be satisfied when
$\epsilon < 3/2$.

(the trapezoidal and explicit midpoint methods), as well as three new

each component can be represented by similar concentric spheroids. After taking
into account both the asymmetric drift effects and the integration along the
line of sight, we produce the rotational velocity and velocity dispersion
profile,_and_ the approximate shape of the line of sight velocity distributions
for the stars as parameterized by the h3 and h4 coefficients of the
Gauss-Hermite expansion of the line profile.
  Photometric and kinematical data have been taken from the literature for the
test case of the S0 galaxy NGC 5866, for which detailed stellar kinematical
data are available at different positions across the galaxy. Apart from the
very inner, dust-obscured regions of the galaxy, where observational effects
are likely to be dominant, the model successfully reproduce the whole set of

valuable in providing insight to GRB radiation mechanisms and in constraining

introduceddecomposition of statistical tensor objects into irreducible
representations of theSO(3) symmetry group (characterized by $j$ and $m$
indices), to disentangle someof these contributions, separating the universal
and the asymptotic from the specific aspects of the flow. The different $j$
contributions transform differently under rotations and so form a complete
basis in which to represent the tensor objects under study. The experimental
data arerecorded with hot-wire probes placed at various heights in the
atmospheric surfacelayer. Time series data from single probes and from pairs of
probes are analyzed to compute the amplitudes and exponents of different
contributions to the second order statistical objects characterized by $j=0$,
$j=1$ and $j=2$. The analysis shows the need to make a careful distinction
between long-lived quasi 2d turbulent motions (close to the ground) and
relatively short-lived 3d motions. We demonstrate that the leading scaling
exponents in the three leading sectors ($j = 0, 1, 2$) appear to be different

scaleproperties. The measured values of the exponent are $\zeta^{(j=0)}_2=0.68

We present theoretical arguments for the values of these exponents usingthe
Clebsch representation of the Euler equations; neglecting anomalous
corrections, the values obtained are 2/3, 1 and 4/3 respectively.

homogeneity of the universe -- in contrast to previous results on this subject.
The crucial additional factor not included in earlier work is the acceleration
of the fundamental observers. We find the complete class of irrotational
perfect fluid spacetimes admitting an exactly isotropic radiation field for
every fundamental observer and show that are FLRW if and only if the
acceleration is zero. While inhomogeneous in general, these spacetimes all
possess three-dimensional symmetry groups, from which it follows that they also
admit a thermodynamic interpretation. In addition to perfect fluids models we
also consider multi-component fluids containing non-interacting radiation, dust
and a quintessential scalar field or cosmological constant in which the
radiation is isotropic for the geodesic (dust) observers. It is shown that the
non-acceleration of the fundamental observers forces these spacetimes to be
FLRW. While it is plausible that fundamental observers (galaxies) in the real
universe follow geodesics, it is strictly necessary to determine this from
local observations for the cosmological principle to be more than an
assumption. We discuss how observations may be used to test this.

We find regularized operators to represent the metric and discuss whether the
coherent states of the quantum theory are peaked around classical spacetimes.
It is shown that, although the expectation value of the metric on Killing
orbits coincides with a classical solution, its relative fluctuations become
significant when one approaches a region where null geodesics are focused. In
that region, the spacetimes described by coherent states fail to admit an
approximate classical description. This result applies as well to the vacuum of

quasiequilibrium states of binary systems in general relativity, several
investigations have been already carried out by assuming conformal flatness of
the spatial part of the metric. However, the validity of the conformally flat
treatment has not been fully analyzed except for axisymmetric configurations.
Therefore it is desirable to solve quasiequilibrium states by developing
totally different methods from the conformally flat scheme. In this paper we
present a new numerical scheme to solve directly the Einstein equations for 3D
configurations without assuming conformal flatness, although we make use of the
simplified metric for the spacetime. This new formulation is the extension of
the scheme which has been successfully applied for structures of axisymmetric
rotating compact stars in general relativity. It is based on the integral
representation of the Einstein equations by taking the boundary conditions at
infinity into account. We have checked our numerical scheme by computing
equilibrium sequences of binary polytropic star systems in Newtonian gravity
and those of axisymmetric polytropic stars in general relativity. We have
applied this numerical code to binary star systems in general relativity and
have succeeded in obtaining several equilibrium sequences of synchronously
rotating binary polytropes with the polytropic indices N = 0.0, 0.5 and 1.0.

quantum causal sets that meets Finkelstein's requirement from `quantum

masses and the lepton-flavor mixing. Neutrino-oscillation solutions for the
atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino deficit can determine the
texture of neutrino mass matrix according to the neutrino mass hierarchies as
Type A: m_3 \gg m_2 \sim m_1, Type B: m_3 \ll m_2 \sim m_1, and Type C: m_3
\sim m_2 \sim m_1. In this paper we study the stability of the lepton-flavor
mixing matrix against quantum corrections for all types of mass hierarchy in
the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model with the effective dimension-five
operator which gives Majorana masses of neutrinos. The relative sign
assignments of neutrino masses in each type play the crucial roles for the
stability against quantum corrections. We find the lepton-flavor mixing matrix
of Type A is stable against quantum corrections, and that of Type B with the
same (opposite) signs of m_1 and m_2 are unstable (stable). For Type C, the
lepton-flavor-mixing matrix approaches to the definite unitary matrix according
to the relative sign assignments of neutrino mass eigenvalues, as the effects
of quantum corrections become large enough to neglect squared mass differences
of neutrinos.

the other hand, it is generally believed that in quantum gravity theories
allowing for topology change, using pair creation and annihilation of geons,
one should be able to recover this theorem. In this paper, we take an
alternative route, and use an algebraic formalism developed in previous work.
We give a description of topological geons where an algebra of ""observables"" is
identified and quantized. Different irreducible representations of this algebra
correspond to different kinds of geons, and are labeled by a non-abelian
""charge"" and ""magnetic flux"". We then find that the usual spin-statistics
theorem is indeed violated, but a new spin-statistics relation arises, when we
assume that the fluxes are superselected. This assumption can be proved if all
observables are local, as is generally the case in physical theories. Finally,
we also show how our approach fits into conventional formulations of quantum
gravity.

contribution to a space-time Wilson loop, with respect to its (expected)
Abelian-like time exponentiation when the temporal side goes to infinity. As
soon as we are in dimensions greater than two, the expected behavior is found.
But if we proceed first to the dimensional limit $D \to 2$, the exponentiation
is not recovered. The limits $T \to \infty$ and $D \to 2$ do not commute. The
other result is the computation in dimensions $D=2+\epsilon$ and in light-cone
gauge with Mandelstam-Leibbrandt prescription of the perturbative ${\cal
O}(g^4)$ contribution to the same Wilson loop, coming from diagrams with a
self-energy correction in the vector propagator. In the limit $\epsilon \to 0$
the result is finite, in spite of the vanishing of the triple vector vertex in
light-cone gauge, and provides the expected agreement with the analogous
calculation in Feynman gauge. Consequences of these results concerning two and
higher-dimensional gauge theories are pointed out.

have shown that the Unruh quantization scheme is valid in the double Rindler
wedge rather than in Minkowski spacetime. The double Rindler wedge is composed
of two disjoint regions ($R$- and $L$-wedges of Minkowski spacetime) which are
causally separated from each other. Moreover the Unruh construction implies
existence of boundary condition at the common edge of $R$- and $L$-wedges in
Minkowski spacetime. Such boundary condition may be interpreted as a
topological obstacle which gives rise to a superselection rule prohibiting any
correlations between $r$- and $l$- Unruh particles. Thus the part of the field
from the $L$-wedge in no way can influence a Rindler observer living in the
$R$-wedge and therefore elimination of the invisible ""left"" degrees of freedom
will take no effect for him. Hence averaging over states of the field in one
wedge can not lead to thermalization of the state in the other. This result is
proved both in the standard and algebraic formulations of quantum field theory
and we conclude that principles of quantum field theory does not give any
grounds for existence of the ""Unruh effect"".

First we investigate the dimension of the chiral correlation functions in the
case when there is no singular vector in any of the representations. Then we
pass to the analysis of the completely degenerate representations. A special
subspace of the h.w. representation spaces, introduced by Nahm, plays an
important role in the considerations. The structure of these subspaces shows a
deep connection with the quantum and classical Toda models and relates certain
completely degenerate representations of the \wg algebra to representations of

is 2/3 of that for a nucleon as predicted by the constituent quark model,
lambdas are found to flow with protons but with a smaller flow parameter as
observed in experiments. For kaons, their repulsive potential, which is
calculated from the impulse approximation using the measured kaon-nucleon
scattering length, leads to a smaller anti-flow than that shown in the
preliminary E895 data. Implications of this discrepancy are discussed.

that the competition between diffusion and advection constants modulates the
oscillation frequency from the bulk oscillation in the long-wave dynamics. Such
a competition implies that phase waves with the flow have a wider variety of
dynamics than waves without the flow.

with the unitary-invariant geometry of Fubini and Study. According to the
principles of geometric quantum mechanics, the detailed physical
characteristics of a given quantum system can be represented by specific
geometrical features that are selected and preferentially identified in this
complex manifold. Here we construct a number of examples of such geometrical
features as they arise in the state spaces for spin-1/2, spin-1, and spin-3/2
systems, and for pairs of spin-1/2 systems. A study is undertaken on the
geometry of entangled states, and a natural measure is assigned to the degree
of entanglement of a given state for a general multi-particle system. The
properties of this measure are analysed for the entangled states of a pair of
spin-1/2 particles. With the specification of a quantum Hamiltonian, the
resulting Schrodinger trajectory induces a Killing field, which is quasiergodic
on a toroidal subspace of the energy surface. When the dynamical trajectory is
lifted orthogonally to Hilbert space, it induces a geometric phase shift on the
wave function. The uncertainty of an observable in a given state is the length
of the gradient vector of the level surface of the expectation of the
observable in that state, a fact that allows us to calculate higher order
corrections to the Heisenberg relations. A general mixed state is determined by
a probability density function on the state space, for which the associated
first moment is the density matrix. The advantage of a general state is in its
applicability in various attempts to go beyond the standard quantum theory.
