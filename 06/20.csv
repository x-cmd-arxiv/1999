  and Radio Observations of 3C 397","Accepted by the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/307985",,"astro-ph",,"  Radio-bright, presumably young supernova remnants offer the opportunity of
studying strong-shock physics and the nature of the interaction of ejected
material with the surrounding medium. We use VLA and ROSAT images of the
radio-bright supernova remnant 3C 397 (G41.1--0.3) to examine the shock
structure in both thermal X-ray emission and nonthermal radio emission. The
unusual rectangular morphology can be seen in VLA maps at 20 and 6 cm
wavelength at a resolution of 6"", and in ROSAT HRI images. The X-ray images
resemble the radio strongly, except for a small, possibly un resolved X-ray hot
spot near the center. There is no variation in the X-ray hardness ratio from
ROSAT Position Sensitive Proportional Counter data across the remnant,
suggesting that at least between 0.4 and 2 keV, the interior emission is not
different in character from that in the bright shell regions. Thus 3C 397 is
not a member of the ``thermal composite'' or ``mixed-morphology'' class (Rho
1998). The remnant is unpolarized at 20 cm, and has a mean fractional
polarization of 1.5% +/- 0.1% at 6 cm. The polarized flux, and polarized
fraction, peak inside the remnant at a location not coincident with either an
internal maximum in total-intensity radio emission, or with the X-ray hot spot.
Spectral-index maps between 6 and 20 cm do not show any systematic differences
associated with interior emission; there appears to be no ``plerionic'' or
pulsar-driven component in 3C 397 at least as normally characterized by high
polarization and a flat radio spectrum. Spectral-index values spread about the
mean by about 0.2, a result consistent with previous work. We make calculations
of the upstream electron diffusion coefficient and the mean density. Finally,
we speculate on possible mechanisms producing the X-ray hot spot.

of Hamiltonian systems because they preserve the geometric structure of the

adaptive timestep control is added to a symplectic integrator. We describe an
adaptive-timestep symplectic integrator that can be used if the Hamiltonian is
the sum of kinetic and potential energy components and the required timestep
depends only on the potential energy (e.g. test-particle integrations in fixed
potentials). In particular, we describe an explicit, reversible, symplectic,
leapfrog integrator for a test particle in a near-Keplerian potential; this
integrator has timestep proportional to distance from the attracting mass and
has the remarkable property of integrating orbits in an inverse-square force
field with only ""along-track"" errors; i.e. the phase-space shape of a Keplerian
orbit is reproduced exactly, but the orbital period is in error by O(1/N^2),
where N is the number of steps per period.

weighted by signed magnifications (magnification times parity) have very simple
properties. In particular, we find that the zeroth moment -- the sum of four
signed magnifications satisfies $\simeq 2/(2-\beta)$; the relation is exact for
$\beta=0$ (point-lens) and $\beta=1$ (isothermal potential), independent of the
axial ratio. Similar relations can be derived when a shear is present along the
major or minor axes. These relations, however, do not hold well for the
closely-related elliptical density distributions. For a singular isothermal
elliptical density distribution without shear, the sum of signed magnifications
for quadruple lenses is $\approx 2.8$, again nearly independent of the
ellipticity. For the same distribution with shear, the total signed
magnification is around 2-3 for most cases, but can be significantly different
for some combinations of the axial ratio and shear where more than four images
can appear.

corrections to the hadronic matrix elements of all operators are calculated at
leading order in the chiral expansion. Numerically, doing a simple scanning of

a \Delta I=1/2 enhancement may be operative for Q_6 similar to the one of Q_1
