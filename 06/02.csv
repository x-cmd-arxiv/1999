During source-transit events spots can cause deviations larger than 2%, and

the lens directly crosses the spot. Its numerical value for a dark spot with
sufficient contrast is found to be roughly equal to the fractional radius of
the spot, i.e., up to 20% in this study. Spots can also be efficiently detected

The UHE luminosity density is found to be similar to that derived for GeV

small angular scale, if confirmed, would rule out most proposed source models.
More generally, it is argued that the highest energy particles can only be
accelerated in sites that can induce an EMF ${\cal E}\go3\times10^{20}$ V and
an associated power $L_{min} \go {\cal E}^2/Z\sim10^{39}$ W, where $Z$ is the

acceleration, unipolar induction and magnetic flares are the three most potent,

assumed to be smaller and larger, respectively, than those in the outer region.
It is found that at the stage $z_1 < z < 1.5$ the distances from an observer in
the inner void-like region are larger than the counterparts (with equal $z$) in
the corresponding homogeneous Friedmann models, and hence the magnitudes for
the sources at this stage are larger. This effect of the void-like low-density

of SNIa from the relation in homogeneous models, independently of the

of remote sources are systematically deformed. The above relation at $z \geq

vastly exceeding the Eddington limit if the flow develops pressures high enough
to allow neutrinos to radiate the released gravitational energy. It has been
suggested that this hypercritical mode of accretion leads inevitably to the
formation of stellar mass black holes during common envelope evolution. We
study the hydrodynamics of this flow at large radii (R >> R_ns), and show that
for low Mach number flows, in two dimensions, modest density gradients in the
stellar envelope suffice to produce a hot, advection dominated accretion disk
around the accreting object. The formation of outflows from such a disk is
highly probable, and we discuss the impact of the resultant mass loss and
feedback of energy into the envelope for the survival of the neutron star.
Unless outflows are weaker than those inferred for well observed accreting
systems, we argue that in most cases insufficient accretion occurs to force
collapse to a black hole before the envelope has been ejected. This conclusions
is of interest for black hole formation in general, for some models of gamma
ray bursts, and for predictions of the event rate in future LIGO observations.

only the mass density at the same point, there appears the stochasticity in
such a relation, which is referred to as ``stochastic bias''. The stochasticity
is there because the galaxy number density is not merely a local function of a
mass density field, but it is a nonlocal functional, instead. Thus, the
phenomenological stochasticity of the bias should be accounted for by nonlocal
features of galaxy formation processes. Based on mathematical arguments, we
show that there are simple relations between biasing and nonlocality on linear
scales of density fluctuations, and that the stochasticity in Fourier space
does not exist on linear scales under a certain condition, even if the galaxy
formation itself is a complex nonlinear and nonlocal precess. The stochasticity
in real space, however, arise from the scale-dependence of bias parameter, $b$.
As examples, we derive the stochastic bias parameters of simple nonlocal models
of galaxy formation, i.e., the local Lagrangian bias models, the cooperative
model, and the peak model. We show that the stochasticity in real space is also
weak, except on the scales of nonlocality of the galaxy formation. Therefore,
we do not have to worry too much about the stochasticity on linear scales,
especially in Fourier space, even if we do not know the details of galaxy
formation process.

main conclusion is that the differencies among the various evolutionary results
are still rather large. For example, we found that the H-burning evolutionary
time may differ up to 20 %. An even larger disagreement is found for the
He-burning phase (up to 40-50 %). Since the connection between the various
input physics and the numerical algorithms could amplify or counterbalance the
effect of a single ingredient on the resulting stellar model, the origin of
this discrepancies is not evident. However most of these discrepancies, which
are clearly found in the evolutionary tracks, are reduced on the isochrones. By
means of our updated models we show that the ages inferred by the theory of

the procedure extensively on N-body simulations and find that it gives
generally unbiased results but that the reconstructed velocities tend to be
overpredicted in high-density regions. Applying the formalism to the PSZz

reveal that those problems are caused by the improper treatment of the

solving ZFD and obtaining the equivalent results between these two gauges. The

  Information and Computation. 1999",,,"cs.CL",,"  Particles fullfill several distinct central roles in the Japanese language.
They can mark arguments as well as adjuncts, can be functional or have semantic
funtions. There is, however, no straightforward matching from particles to
functions, as, e.g., GA can mark the subject, the object or an adjunct of a
sentence. Particles can cooccur. Verbal arguments that could be identified by
particles can be eliminated in the Japanese sentence. And finally, in spoken
language particles are often omitted. A proper treatment of particles is thus
necessary to make an analysis of Japanese sentences possible. Our treatment is
based on an empirical investigation of 800 dialogues. We set up a type
hierarchy of particles motivated by their subcategorizational and
modificational behaviour. This type hierarchy is part of the Japanese syntax in
VERBMOBIL.

performance-models of natural language parsing, in particular Data Oriented
Parsing (DOP), points out some of their major shortcomings and suggests
suitable solutions. It provides proofs that various problems of probabilistic
disambiguation are NP-Complete under instances of these performance-models, and
it argues that none of these models accounts for attractive efficiency
properties of human language processing in limited domains, e.g. that frequent
inputs are usually processed faster than infrequent ones. The central
hypothesis of this dissertation is that these shortcomings can be eliminated by
specializing the performance-models to the limited domains. The dissertation
addresses ""grammar and model specialization"" and presents a new framework, the
Ambiguity-Reduction Specialization (ARS) framework, that formulates the
necessary and sufficient conditions for successful specialization. The
framework is instantiated into specialization algorithms and applied to
specializing DOP. Novelties of these learning algorithms are 1) they limit the
hypotheses-space to include only ""safe"" models, 2) are expressed as constrained
optimization formulae that minimize the entropy of the training tree-bank given
the specialized grammar, under the constraint that the size of the specialized
model does not exceed a predefined maximum, and 3) they enable integrating the
specialized model with the original one in a complementary manner. The
dissertation provides experiments with initial implementations and compares the
resulting Specialized DOP (SDOP) models to the original DOP models with
encouraging results.

Reissner-Nordstr\""om black hole inevitably involves an increase in the
black-hole surface area. It is shown that this increase can be minimized if one
considers the capture of the lightest charged particle in nature. The
unavoidable area increase is attributed to two physical reasons: the Heisenberg
quantum uncertainty principle and a Schwinger-type charge emission (vacuum
polarization). The fundamental lower bound on the area increase is $4 \hbar$,
which is smaller than the value given by Bekenstein for neutral particles.
Thus, this process is a better approximation to a reversible process in
black-hole physics. The universality of the minimal area increase is a further
evidence in favor of a uniformly spaced area spectrum for spherical quantum
black holes. Moreover, this universal value is in excellent agreement with the
area spacing predicted by Mukhanov and Bekenstein and independently by Hod.

to combine QFT and string theory in curved backgrounds (particulary here, as
black holes and strings posses intrinsic thermal features and temperatures).
The QFT-Hawking temperature T_H is upper bounded by the string temperature T_S
in the black hole background. The black hole emission spectrum is an incomplete
gamma function of (T_H - T_S). For T_H << T_S, it yields the QFT-Hawking
emission. For T_H \to T_S, it shows highly massive string states dominate the
emission and undergo a typical string phase transition to a microscopic
`minimal' black hole of mass M_{\min} or radius r_{\min} (inversely
proportional to T_S) and string temperature T_S. The semiclassical QFT black
hole (of mass M and temperature T_H) and the string black hole (of mass M_{min}
and temperature T_S) are mapped one into another by a `Dual' transform which
links classical/QFT and quantum string regimes. The string back reaction effect
(selfconsistent black hole solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations
with mass M_+ (radius r_+) and temperature T_+) is computed. Both, the QFT and
string black hole regimes are well defined and bounded: r_{min} leq r_+ \leq
r_S, M_{min} \leq M_+ \leq M, T_H \leq T_+ \leq T_S. The string `minimal' black
hole has a life time tau_{min} \simeq \frac{k_B c}{G \hbar} T^{-3}_S.
