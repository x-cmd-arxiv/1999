AGN, we analyze the equilibrium configuration and the stability of dusty gas in
the circumnuclear regions. It is found that the radiative force by an intensive
starburst can support a stable gaseous wall with a scale-height of several
hundred parsecs. Moreover, by taking the simple stellar evolution in the
starburst into account, we find that the covering factor of the wall decreases
on a time-scale of several $10^7$ yr. The large-scale wall, if formed, works to
obscure the nucleus due to the dust opacity. Hence, it is anticipated that the
index of AGN type tends to shift from higher to lower in several $10^7$ yr
according as the circumnuclear starburst becomes dimmer. On the other hand, if
the AGN itself is brighter than the circumnuclear starburst (e.g. quasar case),
no stable large-scale wall forms. In that case, the AGN is highly probably
identified as type 1. The present mechanism may provide a physical explanation
for the putative correlation between AGN type and host properties that Sy2's
are more frequently associated with circumnuclear starbursts than Sy1's,
whereas quasars are mostly observed as type 1 regardless of star-forming
activity in the host galaxies.

lowest six ionization stages included in the NLTE calculation. We have
investigated the effects of expanded NLTE treatment on the chemical
concentration of astrophysically significant species in the atmosphere, the
equilibrium structure of the atmosphere, and the emergent flux distribution.
Although we have found general qualitative agreement with previous, more
limited NLTE models, the expanded NLTE treatment leads to significantly
different values for the size of many of the NLTE deviations. In particular,
for the hottest model presented here (effective temperature of 35000 K), for
which NLTE effects are largest, we find that the expanded NLTE treatment
reduces the NLTE effects for these important variables: neutral Hydrogen
concentration, pressure structure, and emergent far UV flux. Moreover, we find
that the addition of new NLTE species may greatly affect the concentration of
species that were already treated in NLTE, so that, generally, all species that
contribute significantly to the electron reservoir or to the total opacity, or
whose line spectrum overlaps or interlocks with that of a species of interest,
must be treated in NLTE to insure an accurate result for any particular
species.

function of the cluster age, using whenever possible ages determined through
Stromgren uvby photometry. For the first time in studies of this kind we have
considered separately classical and Herbig Be stars.
  The main results can be summarized as follows:
  1.- Clusters associated to emitting nebulosities and undergoing stellar
formation are rich in emission line objects, which most likely are all pre-main
sequence objects. No bona fide classical Be star has yet been identified among
them.
  2.- Clusters younger than 10 Myr and without associated nebulosity are almost
completely lacking Be stars, despite they have a complete unevolved B main
sequence.
  3.- Classical Be stars appear at an age of 10 Myr, and reach the maximum
abundance in the age interval 14-25 Myr.
  We interpret our results in the sense that the Be phenomenon is an
evolutionary effect which appear in the second half of the main sequence
lifetime of a B star. We propose that it can be related to main structural
changes happening at this evolutionary phase, which also lead to the recently
discovered non-monotonic helium abundance enhancement. The semiconvection or
turbulent diffusion responsible of the surface helium enrichment, coupled with
the high rotational velocity, can generate magnetic fields via the dynamo
effect and thereby originate the Be phenomenon. Observational tests to this
hypothesis are proposed.

recent optical studies of dynamical masses: 1) the emission line velocity
widths of blue galaxies and rotation curves of spirals that trace evolution in

of early type galaxies in the field and clusters to track evolution in the

nuclear burning continuing for at least one month after the outburst. This
means that only a fraction of the previously accreted H and He was ejected

powerful tool for measuring the primary cosmological parameters. However, there
is a large degree of parameter degeneracy in simultaneous measurements of the

use the presently available CMBR data together with measurements of the
cosmological baryon-to-photon ratio, eta, from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, and
the relative mass fraction of baryons in clusters to break the parameter
degeneracy in measuring Omega_m and H_0. We find that present data is
inconsistent with the standard Omega=1, matter dominated model. Our analysis
favours a medium density universe with a rather low
  Hubble parameter. This is compatible with new measurements of type Ia
supernovae, and the joint estimate of the two parameters is Omega_m =
0.45^{+0.07}_{-0.07} and H_0 = 39^{+14}_{-13} km s^-1 Mpc^-1. We stress that
the upper bound on the Hubble parameter is likely to be much more uncertain

matrices drawn from the circular unitary ensemble we prove ergodicity: In the
limits of large matrix dimension and large time window the local time average
has vanishingly small ensemble fluctuations and may be identified with the
ensemble average. By numerically diagonalizing Floquet matrices of kicked tops
with a globally chaotic classical limit we find the same ergodicity. As a
byproduct we find that the traces of random matrices from the circular
ensembles behave very much like independent Gaussian random numbers. Again,
Floquet matrices of chaotic tops share that universal behavior. It becomes

scenario within the superconducting state, using a T-matrix approach which
yields the ground state proposed by Leggett. Here we extend this ground state
analysis to finite temperatures T and interpret the resulting physics. We find
two types of bosonic-like excitations of the system: long lived, incoherent
pair excitations and collective modes of the superconducting order parameter,
which have different dynamics. Using a gauge invariant formalism, this paper
addresses their contrasting behavior as a function of T and superconducting
coupling constant g. At a more physical level, our paper emphasizes how, at
finite T, BCS-BEC approaches introduce an important parameter \Delta^2_{pg} =
\Delta^2 - \Delta_{sc}^2 into the description of superconductivity. This
parameter is governed by the pair excitations and is associated with
particle-hole asymmetry effects which are important for sufficiently large g.
In the fermionic regime, \Delta_{pg}^2 represents the difference between the
square of the excitation gap \Delta^2 and that of the superconducting order
parameter \Delta_{sc}^2. The parameter \Delta_{pg}^2, which is necessarily zero
in the BCS (mean field) limit increases monotonically with the strength of the
attractive interaction g. It follows that there is a significant physical
distinction between this BCS-BEC crossover approach (in which g is the
essential variable which determines \Delta_{pg}) and the widely discussed
(Coulomb-modulated) phase fluctuation scenario in which the plasma frequency is
the tuning parameter.

adaptation to minimize the length of intra-cortical wiring. Thus we can
understand the existing OD patterns by solving a wire length minimization

right-eye dominated. We find that segregation of neurons into monocular regions
reduces wire length if the number of connections with the neurons of the same
class differs from that with the other class. The shape of the regions depends
on the relative fraction of neurons in the two classes. If the numbers are
close we find that the optimal OD pattern consists of interdigitating stripes.
If one class is less numerous than the other, the optimal OD pattern consists
of patches of the first class neurons in the sea of the other class neurons. We
predict the transition from stripes to patches when the fraction of neurons
dominated by the ipsilateral eye is about 40%. This prediction agrees with the
data in macaque and Cebus monkeys. This theory can be applied to other binary

  Cosmology","Grav.Cosmol. 8 (2002) 227-231",,,"gr-qc",,"  We have considered a cosmological model with a cosmological constant of the
form $\Lambda=3\alpha\frac{\dot R^2}{R^2}+\bt\frac{\ddot R}{R} \alpha, \bt=\rm
const.$ The cosmological constant is found to decrease as $t^{-2}$ and the rate
of particle creation is smaller than the Steady State value. We have found that
this behavior gives $\frac{\Lambda_{Pl}}{\Lambda_p}=10^{120}$ where
$\Lambda_{Pl}$ is the value of $\Lambda$ at Planck time. Solutions with
$\bt=3\alpha$ in the radiation dominated era and $\bt=6\alpha$ in the matter
dominated era are equivalent to the FRW results. We have found an inflationary
solution of the de-Sitter type with $\bt=3-3\alpha$. Some problems of the
Standard Model may be resolved with the presence of the above cosmological
constant in the Einstein's equation. Since observations suggest a contribution
of the vacuum energy density in the range $0.40<\Omega^\Lambda<0.76$, one gets
$4<\beta<12$. If $\alpha=0$ the minimum age of the universe is found to be
$H_p^{-1}$ ($H_p$ is the present Hubble constant) with $\beta=\infty$.

occuring when there are naked closed timelike curves. In this case we find that
the spacetime is geodesically complete (with respect to causal geodesics) and
free of singularities. When a partial Cauchy surface exists, we show, by
solving the Klein-Gordon equation, that the absorption cross-section for
massless waves at small frequencies is given by the area of the hole. At high
frequencies a dependence on the angular quantum numbers of the wave develops.
We comment on some aspects of `inertial time travel' and argue that such time
machines cannot be constructed by spinning up a black hole with no naked closed

studied by using the $\Lambda N \to NN$ weak transition potential derived from
the meson exchange mechanism and the direct quark mechanism. The long range
part of the transition potential is described by exchanges of the pseudoscalar
mesons ($\pi$, $K$, $\eta$), while the vector mesons ($\rho$, $\omega$,
$K^\ast$) may be considered as the medium- and short-range part in the meson
exchange picture. We propose the direct quark transition potential as the short
range part, which is derived from the matrix elements of the $\Delta S=1$
effective weak Hamiltonian in the two baryon states. The results indicate that
the direct quark contribution is significantly large and its behavior is
qualitatively different from the vector meson exchanges. We also find that the
decay rate is sensitive to the choice of form factor and that a soft cutoff
must be used for the pion-baryon verteces so that the strong tensor transition
is suppressed. We find that the $\pi + K + DQ$ results are compatible with
experiment although the $n/p$ ratio is still too large. The $\pi^+$ decays of
light hypernuclei are related to the $\DI=3/2$ amplitudes of the nonmesonic
decay. The role of chiral symmetry for the pionic decays are discussed.
