helioseismology has shown that the transition from differential rotation in the
CZ to almost uniform rotation in the radiative solar interior occurs in a
shallow layer called the tachocline. This layer is presumably the seat of large
scale circulation and of turbulent motions. Here, we introduce a macroscopic
transport term in the structure equations, which is based on a hydrodynamical
description of the tachocline proposed by Spiegel and Zahn, and we calculate
the mixing induced within this layer. We discuss the influence of different
parameters that represent the tachocline thickness, the Brunt-Vaissala
frequency at the base of the CZ, and the time dependence of this mixing process
along the Sun's evolution. We show that the introduction of such a process
inhibits the microscopic diffusion by about 25%. Starting from models including
a pre-main sequence evolution, we obtain: a) a good agreement with the observed
photospheric chemical abundance of light elements such as He3, He4, Li7 and
Be9, b) a smooth composition gradient at the base of the CZ, and c) a
significant improvement of the sound speed square difference between the
seismic sun and the models in this transition region, when we allow the
phostospheric heavy element abundance to adjust, within the observational
incertitude, due to the action of this mixing process. The impact on neutrino

model line formation by injecting continuum photons into a static
plane-parallel slab of electrons threaded by a strong neutron star magnetic
field (~ 10^12 G) which may be oriented at an arbitrary angle relative to the
slab normal. We examine two source geometries, which we denote ""1-0"" and ""1-1,""
with the numbers representing the relative electron column densities above and
below the continuum photon source plane. We compare azimuthally symmetric
models, i.e. models in which the magnetic field is parallel to the slab normal,
with models having more general magnetic field orientations. If the bursting
source has a simple dipole field, these two model classes represent line
formation at the magnetic pole, or elsewhere on the stellar surface. We find
that the data of S1 and S2, considered individually, are consistent with both
geometries, and with all magnetic field orientations, with the exception that
the S1 data clearly favor line formation away from a polar cap in the 1-1
geometry, with the best-fit model placing the line-forming region at the
magnetic equator. Within both geometries, fits to the combined (S1+S2) data
marginally favor models which feature equatorial line formation, and in which
the observer's orientation with respect to the slab changes between the two
epochs. We interpret this change as being due to neutron star rotation, and we

general relativistic effects. Such line profiles contain information about the
black hole spin and the accretion disc as well as the geometry of the emitting
region and may help to test general relativity in the strong gravity regime. In
this paper we embark on the computation of the temporal response of the line to
the illuminating flux. Previous studies concentrated on the calculation of
reverberation signatures from static sources illuminating the disc. In this
paper we focus on the more physically justified case of flares located above
the accretion disc and corotating with it. We compute the time dependent iron
line taking into account all general relativistic effects and show that its

the rate of multiple imaging of these sources by intervening gravitational
lenses. Popular CDM models for galaxy formation yield a lensing optical depth
of about 1% for sources at redshift 10. The expected slope of the luminosity
function of the early sources implies an additional magnification bias of about

arcseconds. We also show that there is only a modest redshift evolution in the
mean surface brightness of galaxies at z>2. The expected increase by 1-2 orders
of magnitude in the number of resolved sources on the sky, due to observations
with NGST, will dramatically improve upon the statistical significance of

\sigma \la 2.1$ with $\sigma(\alpha =1.7)= 1.44\pm 0.3 $. The values obtained
from the second spectrum are higher by $\approx 20 %$. If the IGM density
traces the dark matter (DM) as suggested by numerical simulations we have
measured the fluctuation amplitude of the DM density at an effective Jeans
scale of about a hundred to two hundred (comoving) kpc. For CDM-like power
spectra the amplitude of dark matter fluctuations on these small scales depends
on the cosmological density parameter $\Omega$. For power spectra normalized to
reproduce the space density of present-day clusters and with a slope parameter
of $\Gamma=0.21$ consistent with the observed galaxy power spectrum, the
inferred $\Omega$ can be expressed as: $\Omega= 0.61
(\alpha/1.7)^{1.3}(x_{_{\rm J}} /0.62)^{-0.6}$ for a flat universe, and
$\Omega= 0.91(\alpha/1.7)^{1.3} (x_{_{\rm J}}/0.62)^{-0.7}$ for a $\lambda=0$
universe. $x_{_{\rm J}}$ is the effective Jeans scale in (comoving) $\mpc$.
Based on a suit of detailed mock spectra the 1-$\sigma$ error is $\approx 25
%$. The estimates increase with increasing $\Gamma$. For the second spectrum we
obtain 15% lower values.

identical with that found among `superclusters' in Monte Carlo simulations of
random and random- clumped clusters, however, so the rich Abell/ACO clusters

symplectomorphic to a symplectic manifold

effective and Hamiltonian, it can be used for a group theoretical quantization
of the system. The area operator p for the horizon corresponds to the generator
of the compact subgroup SO(2) and becomes quantized accordingly: The positive
discrete series of the irreducible unitary representations of SO_+(1,2) yields
an (horizon) area spectrum proportional k+n, where k =1,2,... characterizes the
representation and n = 0,1,2,... the number of area quanta. If one employs the
unitary representations of the universal covering group of SO_+(1,2) the number
k can take any fixed positive real value (theta-parameter). The unitary

direct correlation between this constrained $m_\n$ and the mass matrix $M_R$

relate the lepton asymmetry $\e$ generated in the decay of the lightest RH

specified in terms of the geometry of the CY manifold and the cycle $\S_4$. It
is chiral and anomalous, however the presence of a three-dimensional
gravitational Chern-Simons terms with a coefficient that jumps when crossing
the wall allows to cancel the anomaly by inflow. Kahler manifolds of special
type, where the potential depends only on the real part of the complex
coordinate, are shown to emerge as the target spaces of two-dimensional
sigma-models when the M5 is wrapped on $\S_3 \times S^1$, thus providing a
physical realization of some recent symplectic construction by Hitchin.

physics of expansion of the system created in high energy nuclear collisions is
discussed. Since in the hydro limit the centrality dependence of elliptic flow
is mostly defined by the elliptic anisotropy of the overlapping region of the
colliding nuclei, and in the low density limit by the product of the elliptic
anisotropy and the multiplicity, we argue that the centrality dependence of
elliptic flow should be a good indicator of the degree of equilibration reached
in the reaction. Then we analyze experimental data obtained at AGS and SPS
energies. The observed difference in the centrality dependence of elliptic flow
could imply a transition from a hadronic to a partonic nature of the system
evolution. Finally we exploit the multiplicity dependence of elliptic flow to
make qualitative predictions for RHIC and LHC.

incident energy, the elliptic flow shows a transition from positive to negative
flow. Its magnitude depends on both the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the
nucleon-nucleon scattering cross section. Different elliptic flows are obtained
for a stiff EOS with free nucleon-nucleon cross sections and a soft EOS with
reduced nucleon-nucleon cross sections, although both lead to vanishing
in-plane transverse flow at the same balance energy. The study of both in-plane

simultaneously the information on the nuclear equation of state and the

calculate the negative copper ion. The calculated electron affinity is 1.218

machines (QTMs) and quantum circuit families (QCFs). In this paper we explore
the computational powers of these models and re-examine the claim of the
computational equivalence of these models often made in the literature without
detailed investigations. For this purpose, we formulate the notion of the codes
of QCFs and the uniformity of QCFs by the computability of the codes. Various
complexity classes are introduced for QTMs and QCFs according to constraints on
the error probability of algorithms or transition amplitudes. Their
interrelations are examined in detail. For Monte Carlo algorithms, it is proved
that the complexity classes based on uniform QCFs are identical with the
corresponding classes based on QTMs. However, for Las Vegas algorithms, it is
still open whether the two models are equivalent. We indicate the possibility
that they are not equivalent. In addition, we give a complete proof of the
existence of a universal QTM simulating multi-tape QTMs efficiently. We also
examine the simulation of various types of QTMs such as multi-tape QTMs, single
tape QTMs, stationary, normal form QTMs (SNQTMs), and QTMs with the binary
tapes. As a result, we show that these QTMs are computationally equivalent one
another as computing models implementing not only Monte Carlo algorithms but
exact (or error-free) ones.

states are nonunitary, whereas quantum field theory and its generalizations are
unitary. This problem in the quantum field theory of quantum state diffusion

equation of motion, where Liouville's theorem does not apply to the usual field
theory formulation. This problem is resolved here by doubling the number of
freedoms used to represent a quantum field. The space of quantum fields is then
a classical configuration space, for which volume need not be conserved,
instead of the usual phase space, to which Liouville's theorem applies. The
creation operator for the quantized field satisfies the QSD equations, but the
annihilation operator does not satisfy the conjugate eqation. It appears only
in a formal role.
