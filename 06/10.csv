  Corrected several typographical errors",,"10.1086/312167",,"astro-ph",,"  We present here initial results on the X-ray Cluster Luminosity Function
(XCLF) from the Bright SHARC sample of distant X-ray clusters of galaxies. This
sample is 97% complete in its optical identifications and contains 12 X-ray
luminous clusters in the range 0.3 < z < 0.83 (median z = 0.42) and 1.1 <
Lx(44) < 8.5 erg/s [0.5-2.0 keV]. We present a preliminary selection function
for the Bright SHARC based on Monte Carlo simulations. Using this selection
function, we have computed the Bright SHARC XCLF and find it to be fully
consistent with a non-evolving XCLF to Lx(44) = 5 erg/s and z = 0.7.
  At Lx(44) > 5 erg/s, we find evidence for a deficit of clusters compared to
that expected from a non-evolving XCLF. We detect only one such cluster in the
redshift range 0.3 < z < 0.7 when we would expect 4.9 clusters based on the
local XCLF of De Grandi et al. (1999). The statistical significance of this
deficit is 96%. To increase the statistical significance of this possible
deficit, we have combined the Bright SHARC and the 160 sq. deg. survey of
Vikhlinin et al (1998a). This joint survey covers 260 sq. degs. and contains
only one confirmed 0.3 < z < 0.7, Lx(44) > 5 erg/s cluster, while we would
expect 7.6 such clusters based on the local XCLF (De Grandi et al. 1999). The
statistical significance of the deficit in this joint survey increases to
99.5%. These results remain preliminary because of incompletenesses in the
optical follow-up and uncertainties in the local XCLF.

the galaxy's center which may include a massive black hole. The gravitational
interactions between the rings and between the rings and the center is fully
accounted for, but the halo and bulge components are treated as passive
gravitational field sources. Equations of motion and a Lagrangian are derived
for the ring + center system, and these lead to total energy and total angular
momentum constants of the motion. We study the eccentric dynamics of a disk
with an exponential surface density distribution represented by a large number
of rings. The inner part of the disk is found to be strongly unstable. Angular
momentum of the rings is transferred outward and to the central mass if
present, and a trailing one-armed spiral wave is formed in the disk. We also
analyze a disk with a modified exponential density distribution where the
density of the inner part of the disk is reduced. In this case we find much
slower, linear growth of the eccentric motion. A trailing one-armed spiral wave
forms in the disk and becomes more tightly wrapped as time increases. The
motion of the central mass if present is small compared with that of the disk.

clear that the Ar VI line and possibly also other lines have increased in

a change in the spectral energy distribution of the central star, possibly an
increase in effective temperature. However, this result needs to be confirmed

  We also report a non-detection of the O IV 25.9 micron line and the first

non-detection is not expected based on a blackbody approximation for the

measuring the orbital radius and thus substantially refining the compact object

i.) the space density of DLAs at z=2.3 is equal to the space density of spiral

based estimator system which performs well the frequency extraction in unevenly
sampled signals. It uses an unsupervised Hebbian nonlinear neural algorithm to
extract, from the interpolated signal, the principal components which, in turn,
are used by the MUSIC frequency estimator algorithm to extract the frequencies.
The neural network is tolerant to noise and works well also with few points in
the sequence. We benchmark the system on synthetic and real signals with the
Periodogram and with the Cramer-Rao lower bound.

  galaxies in the hierarchical clustering scenario?","13 pages, 12 figures, submitted to MNRAS",,,"OU-TAP 100","astro-ph",,"  We examined the physical origin of the colour-magnitude relation of
elliptical galaxies in clusters of galaxies in the hierarchical clustering
scenario by using a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. We particularly
investigate the effects of the star formation process, the supernova feedback
and the UV background on the formation and evolution of elliptical galaxies.
  It is suggested by observation that the colour-magnitude relation reflects
the metallicity-luminosity relation of galaxies, and that for reproducing the
colour-magnitude relation it is important to suppress the chemical enrichment
of stars in faint galaxies. For suppressing the chemical enrichment, we propose
some solutions. One is assuming a strong supernova feedback. Another is
introducing the effect of the UV background radiation. These solutions
degenerate, but they may be distinguished by studying other properties of
galaxies, like the luminosity function, colour distribution, etc.
  Moreover, we find that the supernova feedback model in the starburst which
make the bulge component is important when the star formation time-scale in
disc is longer than the age of the Universe. On the other hand, when the star
formation time-scale is short, the resulting colour-magnitude relation does not
depend on such a starburst model because most of stars are formed not by the
burst but by the ordinary star formation process in disc.

white dwarfs has been the subject of considerable interest. While theoretical
calculations can demonstrate that radiative forces, counteracting the effects
of gravitational settling, can explain the detections of individual species,
the predicted abundances do not accord well with observation. However, accurate
abundance measurements can only be based on a thorough understanding of the
physical structure of the white dwarf photospheres, which has proved elusive.
Recently, the availability of new non-LTE model atmospheres with improved
atomic data has allowed self-consistent analysis of the EUV, far UV and optical
spectra of the prototypical object G191$-$B2B. Even so, the predicted and
observed stellar fluxes remain in serious disagreement at the shortest
wavelengths (below $\approx 190$\AA), while the inferred abundances remain
largely unaltered. We show here that the complete spectrum of G191$-$B2B can be
explained by a model atmosphere where Fe is stratified, with increasing
abundance at greater depth. This abundance profile may explain the difficulties
in matching observed photospheric abundances, usually obtained by analyses
using homogeneous model atmospheres, to the detailed radiative levitation
predictions. Particularly as the latter are only strictly valid for regions
deeper than where the EUV/far UV lines and continua are formed. Furthermore,
the relative depletion of Fe in the outer layers of the atmosphere may be
evidence for radiatively driven mass loss in G191$-$B2B.

  References added",,,,"hep-th",,"  In this thesis I present applications of the Born-Infeld action to the
description of D-branes, mostly in the context of type IIB string theory. First
I present the Callan-Maldacena construction of a fundamental string attached to
a threebrane, whereby the string is made out of the wrapped brane. This
interpretation withstands a rather detailed scrutiny, including the magnitude
of the static tension and of the B-I charge; and Polchinski's mixed
Dirichlet/Neumann boundary conditions for small perturbations of the string.
The latter arise dynamically from the full non-linear equations of motion.
Also, the Born-Infeld charge is shown to produce the correct form of dipole
radiation under the influence of harmonic oscillations of the string. The
second part comprises of the application of these ideas to the AdS/CFT
correspondence. Using the essentially non-perturbative nature of the B-I action
we were able to construct in the near-horizon geometry of N D3-branes the
color-singlet baryon vertex of the SU(N) gauge theory as a fivebrane wrapped on
the $S^5$ sphere, with B-I strings playing the role of the quarks. Also, in the
asymptotically flat background we obtain a smooth classical description of the
Hanany-Witten phenomenon. In the case of non-extremal background we construct
baryons of the three-dimensional non-supersymmetric theory, the low energy
dynamics of which was conjectured to be equivalent to ordinary QCD. Our
approach allows to exhibit confining properties of color flux tubes, i.e. the
dependence of the tension of the flux tube on its color content. We do this by
building an extended baryon, where a fraction $\nu$ of the total of N quarks is
removed to a finite distance.

for classical point particles is described by an action functional living on a
circle, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition for electric and magnetic
charges holds. The inconsistent classical field theory depends on an arbitrary,
but fixed, external vector field, a generalization of the Dirac-string.
Nevertheless, the Quantum Field Theory, obtained from this classical action via
a functional integral approach, turns out to be independent of the particular
vector field chosen, and thus consistent, if the Dirac-Schwinger quantization
condition holds. We provide explicit expressions for the generating functionals
of observables, proving that they are Dirac-string independent. Since
Lorentz-invariance is manifest at each step, the quantum theory admits also a
manifestly diffeomorphism invariant coupling to external gravity. Relations
with previous formulations, and with SO(2)--non invariant theories are
clarified.

conditions appear to exclude two certain flatness of M and of M'. From the
point of view of CR geometry, a real analytic CR manifold M can be flat in
essentially to ways, being biholomorphic to a product M_1\times \Delta^k, k\geq
1, by a polydisc (algebraic degeneracy), or to a product M_1\times I^l,l\geq 1
by a real cube (transversal degeneracy), in a neighborhod of a Zariski generic

Tumanov at a generic point. Our first result provides a characterization of
mappings with positive transcendence degree k. Such maps have the property that
near a Zariski generic point f(p) in M', there exists a k-algebraically
degenerate real algebraic set X'' which contains f(M) and which is contained in
M'. This solves the algebraic mapping problem for a minimal source M
completely. Our second main result is the construction of canonical foliations
by Segre surfaces of the extrinsic complexification of M. We prove in
particular that a holomorphic function defined in a neighborhood of a minimal M

d-space and Coxeter's regular hyperbolic honeycombs (with infinite or
star-shaped cells or vertex figures) with respect of possible embedding,
isometric up to a scale, of their skeletons into a m-cube or m-dimensional
cubic lattice. In section 2 the last remaining 2-dimensional case is decided:
for any odd m>6, star-honeycombs {m, m/2} are embeddable while {m/2, m} are not
(unique case of non-embedding for dimension 2). As a spherical analogue of
those honeycombs, we enumerate, in section 3, 36 Riemann surfaces representing
all nine regular polyhedra on the sphere. In section 4, non-embeddability of
all remaining star-honeycombs (on 3-sphere and hyperbolic 4-space) is proved.
In the last section 5, all cases of embedding for dimension d>2 are identified.
Besides hyper-simplices and hyper-octahedra, they are exactly those with
bipartite skeleton: hyper-cubes, cubic lattices and 8, 2, 1 tilings of
hyperbolic 3-, 4-, 5-space (only two, {435} and {4335}, of those 11 are
compact).

  Rev. C","Phys.Rev. C60 (1999) 034304","10.1103/PhysRevC.60.034304",,"nucl-th",,"  We study the extrapolation of nuclear shell structure to the region of
superheavy nuclei in self-consistent mean-field models -- the
Skyrme-Hartree-Fock approach and the relativistic mean-field model -- using a
large number of parameterizations. Results obtained with the Folded-Yukawa
potential are shown for comparison. We focus on differences in the isospin
dependence of the spin-orbit interaction and the effective mass between the
models and their influence on single-particle spectra. While all relativistic
models give a reasonable description of spin-orbit splittings, all
non-relativistic models show a wrong trend with mass number. The spin-orbit
splitting of heavy nuclei might be overestimated by 40%-80%. Spherical
doubly-magic superheavy nuclei are found at (Z=114,N=184), (Z=120,N=172) or
(Z=126,N=184) depending on the parameterization. The Z=114 proton shell
closure, which is related to a large spin-orbit splitting of proton 2f states,
is predicted only by forces which by far overestimate the proton spin-orbit
splitting in Pb208. The Z=120 and N=172 shell closures predicted by the
relativistic models and some Skyrme interactions are found to be related to a
central depression of the nuclear density distribution. This effect cannot
appear in macroscopic-microscopic models which have a limited freedom for the
density distribution only. In summary, our findings give a strong argument for
(Z=120,N=172) to be the next spherical doubly-magic superheavy nucleus.

force in the recent Casimir force measurement employing an Atomic Force
Microscope. The roughness of the test bodies-a metal plate and a sphere- was
investigated with the Atomic Force Microscope and the Scanning Electron
Microscope respectively. It consists of separate crystals of different heights
and a stochastic background. The amplitude of roughness relative to the zero
roughness level was determined and the corrections to the Casimir force were
calculated up to the fourth order in a small parameter (which is this amplitude
divided by the distance between the two test bodies). Also the corrections due
to finite conductivity were found up to the fourth order in relative
penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point oscillations into the metal.
The theoretical result for the configuration of a sphere above a plate taking
into account both corrections is in excellent agreement with the measured
Casimir force.
