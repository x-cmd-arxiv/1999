a typical photon flux expected in top-down scenarios of UHE CR, the predicted

improve existing bounds on the latter by two orders of magnitude.

expect. However, perturbations are usually represented by fields on the
background spacetime, and expanded at different orders into contributions that
may or may not be gauge independent. We show that perturbations of scalar

are gauge dependent at higher order. Gauge invariance to first order plays
therefore an important conceptual role in the theory, for it selects the
perturbations with direct physical meaning from those having only a

superposition of linear gravitational waves on the mean gravitational field up
to second order in the wave amplitudes. The background field is taken as an
Einstein-deSitter geometry. In order to follow inflationary scenarios, the
wavelengths are allowed to exceed the temporary Hubble distance. As in optical
coherence theory, the wave amplitudes are considered as random variables, which
form a homogeneous and isotropic stochastic process, sharing the symmetries of
the background metric. The effective stress-energy tensor for the random waves
is calculated in terms of correlation functions and covers subhorizon as well
as superhorizon modes, the latter give in many cases negative contributions to
energy density and pressure. We discuss solutions of the second-order equations
including pure gravitational radiation universes.

the stress tensor and entropy of some particular states, we identify unexpected
increases in the entropy of Super-Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling that are
not accompanied by increases in the energy. We describe a highly degenerate
state at zero temperature and zero energy density. We also find that the
entanglement entropy across a Rindler horizon in exact AdS_5 is larger than
might have been expected from the dual SYM theory. Besides, we show that
hyperbolic black holes can be described as thermal Rindler states of the dual
conformal field theory in flat space.

first law of thermodynamics. We show that the same remains true in the
near-horizon limit, for BPS probes only, with the BPS probe moving from AdS
infinity to the horizon. This is a quantitative indication that the brane-probe
reaching the horizon corresponds to thermalization in gauge theory. It is shown
that this relation provides a way to reliably compute the entropy away from the

reported. More than 50 $\gamma$ transitions with $E_{\gamma} < 4$ MeV were
detected indicating a strong fragmentation of the electromagnetic excitation
strength. For the first time microscopic calculations making use of a complete
configuration space for low-lying states are performed in heavy odd-mass
spherical nuclei. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the
data. It is concluded that although the E1 transitions are the strongest ones
also M1 and E2 decays contribute substantially to the observed spectra. In
contrast to the neighboring even $^{116-124}$Sn, in $^{117}$Sn the $1^-$
component of the two-phonon $[2^+_1 \otimes 3^-_1]$ quintuplet built on top of
the 1/2$^+$ ground state is proved to be strongly fragmented.

effective Lagrangian (QHD1) involving nucleons, scalar mesons and vector
mesons. We show that the necessary variational principle is a constrained one
which fixes the expectation value of the total momentum operator $P^+$ to be
the same as that for $P^-$. This is the same as minimizing the sum of the total
momentum operators: $P^-+P^+$. We obtain a new light-front version of the
equation that defines the single nucleon modes. The solutions of this equation
are approximately a non-trivial phase factor times certain solutions of the
usual equal-time Dirac equation. The ground state wave function is treated as a
meson-nucleon Fock state, and the meson fields are treated as expectation
values of field operators in that ground state. The resulting equations for
these expectation values are shown to be closely related to the usual meson
field equations. A new numerical technique to solve the self-consistent field
equations is introduced and applied to $^{16}$O and $^{40}$Ca. The computed
binding energies are essentially the same as for the usual equal-time theory.
The nucleon plus momentum distribution (probability for a nucleon to have a
given value of $p^+$) is obtained, and peaks for values of $p^+$ about seventy
percent of the nucleon mass. The mesonic component of the ground state wave
function is used to determine the scalar and vector meson momentum distribution
functions, with a result that the vector mesons carry about thirty percent of
the nuclear plus-momentum. The vector meson momentum distribution becomes more
concentrated at $p^+=0$ as $A$ increases.

data among the low-lying levels are in good agreement with the SU(3) dynamical
symmetry of the spdf interacting boson model proposed by Engel and Iachello to
describe collective rotation with octupole vibration. These results show that
these nuclei have SU(3) dynamic symmetry to a good approximation. Also in this
work many algebraic expressions for electric dipole transitions in the SU(3)
limit of the spdf-IBM have been obtained. These formulae together with the
formulae given previously exhaust nearly all the E1 transitions for low-lying
negative parity states. They are useful in analyzing experimental data.
