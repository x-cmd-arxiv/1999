Timing Explorer (RXTE) in October-December 1998. During these months, the
source underwent a spectacular flare; at its peak on November 10, its 2-10 keV
flux was $3.33 \times 10^{-10} {\rm ~erg ~cm^{-2} ~s^{-1}}$, over 30 times
brighter than in quiescence. During the rising phase, the X-ray spectrum of PKS
2005-489 hardened considerably, reaching $\alpha = 1.32~ (F_\nu \propto
\nu^{-\alpha})$ near maximum. During the declining phase, the X-ray spectrum
steepened rapidly, reaching $\alpha = 1.82$, then became somewhat harder
towards the end of December ($\alpha \sim 1.6$). While such behavior has been
seen before, the simplicity, magnitude and duration of this flare allowed us to
study it in great detail. We argue that this flare was caused by either the
injection of particles into the jet or {\it in situ} particle acceleration, and
that the spectral steepening which followed the flare maximum was the result of
synchrotron cooling. Contrary to other recently observed blazar flares (e.g.,
Mkn 501, 3C 279, PKS 2155-304), our results do not imply a major shift in the
location of the synchrotron peak during this flare.

elliptical galaxies can be realized by dissipationless gravitational collapse.
The initial models consist of power-law density spheres such as $\rho\propto
r^{-1}$ with anisotropic velocity dispersions. Collapse simulations are carried
out by integrating the collisionless Boltzmann equation directly, on the
assumption of spherical symmetry. From the results obtained, the extent of
constant density cores, formed through violent relaxation, decreases as the
velocity anisotropy increases radially, and practically disappears for
extremely radially anisotropic models. As a result, the relaxed density
distributions become more cuspy with increasing radial velocity anisotropy. It
is thus concluded that the velocity anisotropy could be a key ingredient for
the formation of density cusps in a dissipationless collapse picture. The
velocity dispersions increase with radius in the cores according to the nearly
power-law density distributions. The power-law index, $n$, of the density
profiles, defined as $\rho\propto r^{-n}$, changes from $n\approx 2.1$ at
intermediate radii, to a shallower power than $n\approx 2.1$ toward the centre.
This density bend can be explained from our postulated local phase-space
constraint that the phase-space density accessible to the relaxed state is
determined at each radius by the maximum phase-space density of the initial
state.

global star formation rates of disk galaxies and circumnuclear starbursts.
Previous theories based on the growth rate of gravitational perturbations
ignore the dynamically important presence of magnetic fields. Theories based on
triggering by spiral density waves fail to explain star formation in systems
without such waves. Furthermore, observations suggest gas and stellar disk
instabilities are decoupled. Following Gammie, Ostriker & Jog (1991), the cloud
collision rate is set by the shear velocity of encounters with initial impact
parameters of a few tidal radii, due to differential rotation in the disk.
This, together with the effective confinement of cloud orbits to a two
dimensional plane, enhances the collision rate above that for particles in a
three dimensional box. We predict Sigma_{SFR}(R) proportional to Sigma_{gas}
Omega (1-0.7 beta). For constant circular velocity (beta = 0), this is in
agreement with recent observations (Kennicutt 1998). We predict a B-band
Tully-Fisher relation: L_{B} proportional to v_{circ}^{7/3}, also consistent
with observations. As additional tests, we predict enhanced star formation in
regions with relatively high shear rates, and lower star formation efficiencies
in clouds of higher mass.

redshift range z = 0.035-0.066. The clusters also range in morphology from
spiral-rich, irregular systems to centrally concentrated cD clusters rich in
early-type galaxies. Globular cluster specific frequencies S_N and luminosity
function dispersions are measured for a total of 9 galaxies in six central
fields. The measured values of S_N for the six brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs) are all higher than typical values for giant ellipticals, in accord with
the known S_N-density correlations. The three non-BCGs analyzed also have
elevated values of S_N, confirming that central location is a primary factor.
The number of GCs per unit mass for these fields are consistent with those
found in an earlier sample, giving further evidence that GC number scales with
mass and that the S_N variations are due to a deficit of halo light, i.e., S_N
reflects mass-to-light ratio.
  The discussion builds on an earlier suggestion that the GCs (both metal rich
and metal poor) around the central cluster galaxies were assembled at early
times, and that star formation halted prematurely in the central galaxies at
the epoch of cluster collapse. This is consistent with recent simulations of
BCG/cluster formation. The subsequent addition of luminous material through
cluster dynamical evolution can cause S_N to decrease, and we may be seeing the
first evidence of this. Finally, the GC luminosity function measurements are
used to constrain the relative distances of the three clusters that make up the
Hercules supercluster.

reach minimum first. We also find a strong modulation at a period of 142 +/- 7

accretion disc. Strong modulation of the hard and soft X-ray flux at this long

flow and corona in the low state. We present the basic components required for
more detailed future modelling of the system - including a partially optically
thick jet, quasi-continuous in the low state, the base of which acts as the
Comptonising corona. In addition, we find that there are a number of flares

different types of intermittency may occur in different solar-type stars or

meteorology to finance; the more this task is difficult, the more a system is
{\it complex}. Nevertheless, even according to this restricted definition, a
general consensus on what should be the correct indicator for complexity is
still not reached. In particular, this characterization is still lacking for
systems whose time evolution is influenced by factors which are not under

how to find the correct indicators for complexity in the information theory
context. The crucial point is that the answer is twofold depending on the fact
that the random parameters are measurable or not. The content of this
apparently trivial observation has been often ignored in literature leading to
paradoxical results. Predictability is obviously larger when the random
parameters are measurable, nevertheless, in the contrary case, predictability
improves when the unknown random parameters are time correlated.

depend on handedness. Furthermore we argue that it is the conservation of
parity in the electromagnetic and strong interactions rather than parity
violation in the weak interactions that needs an explanation. We derive this
parity conservation and indeed the whole system of Weyl fermion representations

existence might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model, for instance in
form of its minimal supersymmetric extension (MSSM). In this work we present
first results on the expected precision of the partial $\Gamma (H

do not decouple in general and differences between the SM and MSSM predictions
can differ by up to 10% even in the decoupling limit of large pseudoscalar
Higgs masses. This regime is difficult and for some values of $\tan \beta$

solutions only if the coupling constant is $\lambda=\sqrt{2(2n+1)\pi}, n\in
{\bf N}$. These fermions are inequivalent and only for $n=1$ they are canonical
fields. In the general case solutions are anyons. Different anyons (which are
uncountably many) live in orthogonal spaces and obey dynamical equations (of
the type of Heisenberg's ""Urgleichung"") characterized by the corresponding
values of the statistic parameter. Thus statistic parameter turns out to be
related to the coupling constant $\lambda$ and the whole Hilbert space becomes
non-separable with a different ""Urgleichung"" satisfied in each of its sectors.
This feature certainly cannot be seen by any power expansion in $\lambda$.
Moreover, since the latter is tied to the statistic parameter, it is clear that
such an expansion is doomed to failure and will never reveal the true structure
of the theory.
  The correlation functions in the temperature state for the canonical dressed
fermions are shown by us to coincide with the ones for bare fields, that is in
agreement with the uniqueness of the $\tau$-KMS state over the CAR algebra
($\tau$ being the shift automorphism). Also the $\alpha$-anyon two-point
function is evaluated and for scalar field it reproduces the result that is
known from the literature.

asymmetry for the quasifree photoproduction of kaons in a relativistic

observables is threefold. First, polarization observables are more effective
discriminators of subtle dynamics than the unpolarized cross section. Second,
earlier nonrelativistic calculations suggest an almost complete insensitivity
of polarization observables to distortions effects. Finally, this insensitivity
entails an enormous simplification in the theoretical treatment. Indeed, by
introducing the notion of a ``bound-nucleon propagator'' we exploit Feynman's
trace techniques to develop closed-form, analytic expressions for all
photoproduction observables. Moreover, our results indicate that polarization
observables are also insensitive to relativistic effects and to the nuclear
target. Yet, they are sensitive to the model parameters, making them ideal
tools for the study of modifications to the elementary amplitude --- such as in
the production, propagation, and decay of nucleon resonances --- in the nuclear
medium.

of violation of validity criteria and non-thermal Doppler effects. More
independent determinations of line widths for multiply-ionized non-hydrogenic
ions are called for, but meanwhile caution should be exercised in the use of
corresponding semiclassically calculated widths, e.g., in opacity calculations
or for plasma density diagnostics. Only the quantum calculations allow a clear
separation of elastic and inelastic scattering contributions to the width. For
B III, elastic scattering contributes about 30% whereas for Ne VII inelastic
scattering dominates. This allows rather direct comparisons with benchmark
electron-ion scattering experiments.

relatively simple prototype of high-dimensional dynamics, showing many
interesting and typical phenomena like synchronisation, cluster formation and
multistability, and having potential applications in systems like Josephson
junction arrays or in biophysical models. There exists a wealth of numerical
investigations of globally coupled maps. While much progress has been made in
the explanation of the macroscopic behaviour of such systems in the limit of
infinite N, there is still need for a sound theory about the asymptotic
behaviour of finite-N systems as N approaches infinity. This article introduces
a method by which it is possible to obtain asymptotic estimates for long-term
deviations from the thermodynamic limit behaviour. This method is based upon
the concept of quasipotentials, originally developed by Freidlin, Wentzell, and
others for describing the influence of small random perturbations on the
long-term behaviour of dynamical systems. The problems of explicitly computing
quasipotentials in the present context and potential approximation schemes are
discussed. All the concepts described in this article are illustrated with a
