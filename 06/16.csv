  1) an extended grid of Kurucz models is employed,
  2) the IUE NEWSIPS data are placed on the FOS absolute flux system using the

  3) all of the model parameters and the effects of interstellar extinction are
solved for simultaneously.

microturbulence velocities of lightly reddened B0-A0 V stars are determined to
high precision. We also demonstrate that the same procedure can be used to fit
the energy distributions of stars which are reddened by any UV extinction curve

scheme.
  We present an initial set of results and verify our approach through
comparisons with angular diameter measurements and the parameters derived for
an eclipsing B star binary. We demonstrate that the metallicity derived from
the ATLAS 9 fits to main sequence B stars is essentially the Fe abundance. We
find that a near zero microturbulence velocity provides the best-fit to all but
the hottest or most luminous stars (where it may become a surrogate for
atmospheric expansion), and that the use of white dwarfs to calibrate UV

rate D and the its time average are also characterized by approximately
lognormal distributions, as found in an earlier work. The correlation time of
(log D)' is about 3 days. We find a significant physical anticorrelation
between (log D)' and the amount of plage magnetic flux of the same polarity in
an annulus around the spot on Kitt Peak magnetograms. The anticorrelation is
interpreted in terms of a generalization of the turbulent erosion model of
sunspot decay to the case when the flux tube is embedded in a preexisting
homogeneous ""plage"" field. The decay rate is found to depend inversely on the
value of this plage field, the relation being very close to logarithmic, i.e.
the plage field acts as multiplicative noise in the decay process. A Gaussian
probability distribution of the field strength in the surrounding plage will
then naturally lead to a lognormal distribution of the decay rates, as
observed. It is thus suggested that, beside other multiplicative noise sources,
the environmental effect of surrounding plage fields is a major factor in the
origin of lognormally distributed large random deviations from the mean law in

the debris from an individual supernova. High frequency supernova H events and
low frequency supernova L events are proposed in the model with characteristics
determined by the meteoritic data on I129 and Hf182. The yields in an H or L

stars with log epsilon (Eu) = -2.98 to -2.22 were formed from an ISM
contaminated most likely by a single H event within the first 10**7 yr of the
Galactic history and should have an Ag/Eu abundance ratio less than the
corresponding solar r-process value by a factor of at least 10. Many of the
very metal-poor stars observed so far are considered here to have been formed
from an ISM contaminated by many (about 10) r-process events. Stars formed from
an ISM contaminated only by a pure L event would have an Ag/Eu ratio higher
than the corresponding solar r-process value but would be difficult to find due
to the low frequency of the L events. However, variations in the relative
abundances of the low and high mass regions should be detectable in very
metal-poor stars.

M_h, but its scatter for a given mass is substantial. The mass and circular

In all simulations, clusters were initially in virial equilibrium. We found
that more than half of the total mass escaped from individual galaxies within a
few crossing times of the cluster, and that a diffuse halo was formed. The
growth rate of the common halo depended on the size of individual galaxies only
weakly. The stripping of the mass from galaxies was mainly due to the
interaction of galaxies, not due to the effect of the tidal field of the
cluster potential. The amount of stripped mass was larger for galaxies in the
central region than for those in the outer region, since the interactions were
more frequent in the central region. As a result, a positive correlation
between the distance from the center and the mass of the galaxy developed. The
volume-density profile of the common halo is expressed as $\rho\propto r^{-1}$
in the central region. This mass distribution is consistent with the mass
distribution in clusters estimated using X-ray observations.

that at least some of these gaps may be occuring at a particular value of the
stellar mass, common to a number of different clusters. From the CMD of NGC

in a series of recurrent mild flashes and the ashes of hydrogen burning build
up a helium layer at the base of which a He flash eventually occurs. In
previous studies involving accretion at higher rates and including initially
more massive WDs, the diffusion of energy inward from the H shell-flashing
region contributes to the increase in the temperature at the base of the helium
layer, and the mass of the helium layer when the He flash begins is
significantly smaller than in a comparison model accreting pure helium; the He
shell flash is not strong enough to develop into a supernova explosion. In
contrast, for the conditions adopted here, the temperature at the base of the
He layer becomes gradually independent of the deposition of energy by H shell
flashes, and the mass of the He layer when the He flash occurs is a function
only of the accretion rate, independent of the hydrogen content of the accreted
matter. When the He flash takes place, due to the high degeneracy at the base
of the He layer, temperatures in the flashing zone will rise without a

a function of column density (N) for the low column density absorption lines.
This explains the existence of the lower envelope which is clearly seen in
scatter plots of the b(N)-distribution in observed QSO spectra. We show that
the parameters of the cutoff in the b(N)-distribution are strongly correlated

determine these relations, which can then be applied to the observed cutoff in

Carlo simulations of Keck spectra at z=3, we show that determining the slope of
the equation of state will be difficult, but that the amplitude can be
determined to within ten per cent, even from a single QSO spectrum. Measuring

  Proceedings of the Ringberg Workshop on Diffuse Thermal and Relativistic
  Plasma in Galaxy Clusters",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Models for the integrated relativistic electron population in clusters of
galaxies are presented. The results depend on the history of electron
acceleration in the cluster. If there is no present particle acceleration or
other sources, then no high energy electrons (gamma >~ 300, E >~ 150 MeV)
should be present due to inverse Compton (IC) losses. High energy electrons are
present if particle acceleration is occurring at present, perhaps as a result
of a cluster merger shock. The resulting IC, synchrotron, and gamma-ray
emission from these models has been calculated. In the models, extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) and very soft X-ray emission are a nearly ubiquitous feature,
because this emission comes from IC by electrons with the longest lifetimes in
clusters. Diffuse UV and optical emission is also expected in most clusters,
but at levels which will be difficult to observe. Hard X-ray tails and diffuse
radio synchrotron emission are only expected in clusters with recent or current
particle acceleration; for example, this acceleration might be due to
intracluster merger shocks. Gamma-ray observations at energies of around 100
MeV should detect both the dominant population of relativistic electrons and
the corresponding ions. The predicted fluxes are easily detectable with GLAST.

outbursts in relativistic jets. The idea is to use the very well sampled
submillimetre-to-radio long-term light curves of 3C 273 to extract the spectral
and temporal evolution of a typical outburst. The method consists in a
decomposition of these light curves into a series of twelve self-similar
flares. With a model-independent parameterization, we find that the obtained
outburst's evolution is in good qualitative agreement with the expectations of
shock models in relativistic jets. We then derive, by a second approach, the
relevant parameters of three-stage shock models.
  We observe for the first time that the optically thin spectral index is
steeper during the initial rising phase of the evolution than during the final
declining phase as expected by the shock model of Marscher & Gear (1985). We
obtain that this index flattens from alpha=-1.1 to alpha=-0.5, in good
agreement with what is expected from a power law electron energy distribution
with an index of -2.0. The observed flattening gives support to the idea that
radiative (synchrotron and/or Compton) losses are the dominant cooling process
of the electrons during the initial phase of the shock evolution.
  Two other results give us confidence in our decomposition: 1) the outbursts
that we identify do well correspond to the VLBI components observed in the jet
and 2) there is strong evidence that high-frequency peaking outbursts evolve
faster than low-frequency peaking outbursts. We propose that this last
correlation is related to the distance from the core of the jet at which the
shock forms.

temperature in systems with AF couplings stronger than SC ones. Its relation
with the spin-gap phenomenon is addressed. The SO(5) theory in an external
magnetic field is also investigated. At sufficiently large g fields the SC
order is established through a first-order freezing transition of the flux-line
lattice. Short-range AF fluctuations are larger at cores of flux lines than
elsewhere, and decrease continuously to zero with increasing g field. At
intermediate g fields, the flux-line lattice of long-range SC order and the
long-range AF order coexist. Superlattice spots surrounding the strong AF Bragg
peaks at Q=(\pm\pi,\pm\pi) are observed in the simulated structure factor, and
are identified with the modulation by the triangular flux-line lattice of SC.
The AF phase boundary associated with the continuous onset of long-range AF
order drops sharply to the g axis from a finite temperature in the temperature
vs. g-field phase diagram.

otherwise typical wavelengths in the radiation are larger than the object. The

consequence, the argument justifying the generalized second law from buoyancy
cannot be completed unless the optimal drop point is next to the horizon. The
universal bound on entropy is always a sufficient condition for operation of

radial excitations is constructed. The Lagrangian is derived by bosonization of
a Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type quark model with separable nonlocal
interactions. The nonlocality is described by form factors corresponding to
3-dimensional excited state wave functions. The spontaneous breaking of chiral
symmetry is governed by the standard NJL gap equations. A simple SU(2)xSU(2)
version of the model is used to demonstrate all low-energy theorems to hold
valid in the chiral limit. A more realistic U(3)xU(3) model with 't Hooft
interaction is constructed to describe the mass spectrum of excited scalar,
pseudoscalar, and vector mesons. On the basis of global chiral symmetry, we use
the same form factors for the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons. Having fixed the
form factor parameters by masses of pseudoscalar mesons, we predict the mass
spectrum of scalar mesons. This allows us to interpret experimentally observed
scalar, pseudoscalar, and vector meson states as members of quark-antiquark
nonets. It is shown that the a_0(1450), K^*_0(1430), f_0(1370), f_J(1710)

coming close to reveal our fantasy: solar and atmospheric neutrino data
strongly indicate the need for neutrino conversions, while LSND provides an
intriguing hint. The simplest ways to reconcile these data in terms of neutrino
oscillations invoke a light sterile neutrino in addition to the three active
ones. Out of the four neutrinos, two are maximally-mixed and lie at the LSND
scale, while the others are at the solar mass scale. These schemes can be
distinguished at neutral-current-sensitive solar & atmospheric neutrino
experiments. I discuss the simplest theoretical scenarios, where the lightness
of the sterile neutrino, the nearly maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing, and
the generation of $\Delta {m^2}_\odot$ & $\Delta {m^2}_{atm}$ all follow
naturally from the assumed lepton-number symmetry and its breaking. Although
the most likely interpretation of the present data is in terms of
neutrino-mass-induced oscillations, one still has room for alternative
explanations, such as flavour changing neutrino interactions, with no need for
neutrino mass or mixing. Such flavour violating transitions arise in theories
with strictly massless neutrinos, and may lead to other sizeable flavour
non-conservation effects, such as $\mu \to e + \gamma$, $\mu-e$ conversion in
nuclei, unaccompanied by neutrino-less double beta decay.

estimates were based on analysis of the processes involved in star formation
and in the aggregation and ""clumping"" of matter in the early universe.
  Since then improved equipment and techniques, e.g. Keck and Hubble telescopes
and gravitational lensing, have resulted in reports of observation of early
galaxies having stars that formed as early as 300 million years after the Big
Bang.
  Such new data has led to the abandonment of the several billion years
estimates of the time required for star and galaxy formation; however, an
alternative response to the data would be to re-examine the Hubble theory from
which the age of the universe and the distance to high redshift objects is
determined.

computation is described. Such a set is necessary to perform quantum
computation in a realistic noisy environment. The new basis consists of two
single-qubit gates (Hadamard and ${\sigma_z}^{1/4}$), and one double-qubit gate
(Controlled-NOT). Since the set consisting of Controlled-NOT and Hadamard gates
is not universal, the new basis achieves universality by including only one
additional elementary (in the sense that it does not include angles that are
irrational multiples of $\pi$) single-qubit gate, and hence, is potentially the
simplest universal basis that one can construct. We also provide an alternative
proof of universality for the only other known class of universal and
fault-tolerant basis proposed by Shor and by Kitaev.

the subtlety of quantum theory, including the ""wave-particle duality"" and the

measurement is bound to change the object by destroying the original quantum
coherence between the object and its environment. So the ""physical reality""
should be defined at two levels, the ""thing in itself"" and the ""thing for us"".
The wave function in quantum mechanics is just playing the role for connecting
the two levels of matter via the fictitious measurement.

the limit as $\epsilon\to\infty$ is examined. It is shown that in this limit,
the theory becomes exactly solvable. A generalization of this Hamiltonian,
$H=p^2+x^{2M}(ix)^\epsilon$ (M=1,2,3,...) is also studied, and this
PT-symmetric Hamiltonian becomes exactly solvable in the large-\epsilon limit
as well. In effect, what is obtained in each case is a complex analog of the
Hamiltonian for the square well potential. Expansions about the large-\epsilon
limit are obtained.
