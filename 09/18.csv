obtained. It is shown that equality of velocities of two particles is as
relative a statement as simultaneity of two events is. We obtain the expression
for the redshift of radiation of a rest source which formally reproduces the

galaxies showing some degree of LINER activity (classical LINERs, weak-[O {\sc
i}] LINERs and transition objects), together with $H$-band spectroscopy for
some of them. A careful subtraction of the stellar continuum allows us to
obtain reliable [Fe {\sc ii}]$1.2567 \mu$m/Pa$\beta$ line ratios. We conclude
that different types of LINERs (i.e., photoionized by a stellar continuum or by
an AGN) cannot be easily distinguished based solely on the [Fe {\sc ii}]$1.2567
\mu$m/Pa$\beta$ line ratio.
  The emission line properties of many LINERs can be explained in terms of an
aging starburst. The optical line ratios of these LINERs are reproduced by a
model with a metal-rich H {\sc ii} region component photoionized with a single
stellar temperature $T_* = 38,000 $K, plus a supernova remnant (SNR) component.
The [Fe {\sc ii}] line is predominantly excited by shocks produced by SNRs in
starbursts and starburst-dominated LINERs, while Pa$\beta$ tracks H {\sc ii}
regions ionized by massive young stars. The contribution from SNRs to the
overall emission line spectrum is constrained by the [Fe {\sc ii}]$1.2567
\mu$m/Pa$\beta$ line ratio. Although our models for aging starbursts are
constrained only by these infrared lines, they consistently explain the optical
spectra of the galaxies also.
  The LINER-starburst connection is tested by predicting the time dependence of
the ratio of the ionizing luminosity ($L_{\rm ion}$) to the supernova rate
(SNr), $L_{\rm ion}$/(SNr). We predict the relative number of starbursts to
starburst-dominated LINERs (aging starbursts) and show that it is in
approximate agreement with survey findings for nearby galaxies.

  Quasi-Isentropic Plasmas","14 pages, 10 figures. To appear in ApJ January 2000",,"10.1086/308195",,"astro-ph",,"  The evolution of quasi-isentropic magnetohydrodynamic waves of small but
finite amplitude in an optically thin plasma is analyzed. The plasma is assumed
to be initially homogeneous, in thermal equilibrium and with a straight and
homogeneous magnetic field frozen in. Depending on the particular form of the
heating/cooling function, the plasma may act as a dissipative or active medium
for magnetoacoustic waves, while Alfven waves are not directly affected. An
evolutionary equation for fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves in the single
wave limit, has been derived and solved, allowing us to analyse the wave
modification by competition of weakly nonlinear and quasi-isentropic effects.
It was shown that the sign of the quasi-isentropic term determines the scenario
of the evolution, either dissipative or active. In the dissipative case, when
the plasma is first order isentropically stable the magnetoacoustic waves are
damped and the time for shock wave formation is delayed. However, in the active
case when the plasma is isentropically overstable, the wave amplitude grows,
the strength of the shock increases and the breaking time decreases. The
magnitude of the above effects depends upon the angle between the wave vector
and the magnetic field. For hot (T > 10^4 K) atomic plasmas with solar
abundances either in the interstellar medium or in the solar atmosphere, as
well as for the cold (T < 10^3 K) ISM molecular gas, the range of temperature
where the plasma is isentropically unstable and the corresponding time and
length-scale for wave breaking have been found.

effective temperatures and emission area radii ~10 km), the spectra of two
black hole candidates are significantly different, and the spectra of the
remaining four are consistent with a very large parameter space that includes
the neutron stars. The spectral differences between the neutron stars and black

emission is predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our

additional means for distinguishing between neutron stars and black holes. The

Lense-Thirring effects. We then calculate the precession of an orbiting
gyroscope in a general weak gravitational field, described by a Newtonian
potential (the gravito-electric field) and a vector potential (the
gravito-magnetic field). Next we make a multipole analysis of the potentials
and the precession equations, giving all of these in terms of the spherical
harmonics moments of the density distribution. The analysis is not limited to
an axially symmetric source, although the Earth, which is the main application,
is very nearly axisymmetric. Finally we analyze the precession in regard to the
Gravity Probe B (GP-B) experiment, and find that the effect of the Earth's
quadrupole moment (J_2) on the geodetic precession is large enough to be
measured by GP-B (a previously known result), but the effect on the
Lense-Thirring precession is somewhat beyond the expected GP-B accuracy.

active gas is not at rest but is flowing in a long cylindrical pipe. Up to a
certain section the heat-conducting walls of the pipe are held at low
temperature so that the reaction rate is small and there is no heat release; at
that section the ambient temperature is increased and an exothermic reaction
begins. The question is whether a slow reaction regime will be established or a
thermal explosion will occur. The mathematical formulation of the problem is
presented. It is shown that when the pipe radius is larger than a critical
value, the solution of the new problem exists only up to a certain distance
along the axis. The critical radius is determined by conditions in a problem
with a uniform axial temperature. The loss of existence is interpreted as a
thermal explosion; the critical distance is the safe reactor's length. Both
laminar and developed turbulent flow regimes are considered. In a computational
experiment the loss of the existence appears as a divergence of a numerical
procedure; numerical calculations reveal asymptotic scaling laws with simple

but definitely non-zero amount. We reexamine the very same data and show that
this conclusion is unjustified. The data are in fact consistent with incomplete
similarity in the inertial range, and with an exponent that depends on the
Reynolds number and tends to 2/3 in the limit of vanishing viscosity. If
further data confirm this conclusion, the understanding of local structure
would be profoundly affected.

relativistic heavy ion collisions. E864 at BNL has measured the production of
ten stable light nuclei with nuclear number of A=1 to A=7 at rapidity
$y\simeq1.9$ and $p_{T}/A\leq300MeV/c$. Data were taken with a Au beam of
momentum of 11.5 A $GeV/c$ on a Pb or Pt target with different experimental
settings. The invariant yields show a striking exponential dependence on
nuclear number over ten orders of magnitudes with a penalty factor of about 50
per additional nucleon. This penalty factor is used to estimate the strange
quark matter (strangelet) production in the baryon rich and strangeness
enhanced environment. The measurements of the production of antiproton,
antideuteron, hypernuclei ($^{3}_{\Lambda}H$,$^{4}_{\Lambda}H$), and strongly
unstable nuclear states ($^{4}H$,$^{5}Li$, $^{5}Li^{*}$, $^{5}He$) are
presented as well. A model of local thermal equilibrium with radial flow at the
kinetic freeze-out with a temperature of $T=112\pm10MeV$, chemical potential of
$\mu_{B}=503\pm20MeV$ and flow velocity of about
$\sqrt{V_{\perp}^{2}}\simeq0.5c$ seems to be able to describe the data in the
gross scale with the exceptions of the production of antihyperons and
hypernuclei. The large antihyperon production and the extra penalty for
hypernuclei production are quite surprising.

newly born neutron star is considered. The thermal kaon process, in which kaons
are thermally produced by nucleon-nucleon collisions, is found to be dominant
throughout the equilibration process. Temporal changes of the order parameter
of the condensate and the number densities of the chemical species are obtained
from the rate equations, which include the thermal kaon reactions as well as
the kaon-induced Urca and the modified Urca reactions. It is shown that the
dynamical evolution of the condensate is characterized by three stages: the
first, prior to establishment of a condensate, the second, during the growth
and subsequent saturation of the condensate, and the third, near chemical
equilibrium. The connection between the existence of a soft kaon mode and the
instability of the noncondensed state is discussed. Implications of the
nonequilibrium process on the possible delayed collapse of a protoneutron star
are also mentioned.

depends on the statistical significance of its results. This bias, often called
the file-drawer effect since the unpublished results are imagined to be tucked
away in researchers' file cabinets, is potentially a severe impediment to
combining the statistical results of studies collected from the literature.
With almost any reasonable quantitative model for publication bias, only a
small number of studies lost in the file-drawer will produce a significant
bias. This result contradicts the well known Fail Safe File Drawer (FSFD)
method for setting limits on the potential harm of publication bias, widely
used in social, medical and psychic research. This method incorrectly treats
the file drawer as unbiased, and almost always misestimates the seriousness of
publication bias. A large body of not only psychic research, but medical and
social science studies, has mistakenly relied on this method to validate
claimed discoveries. Statistical combination can be trusted only if it is known
with certainty that all studies that have been carried out are included. Such
certainty is virtually impossible to achieve in literature surveys.

This scheme leads to the first fault-tolerant realization of universal quantum

interactions are required, and (ii) the system remains within the DFS
throughout the entire implementation of a quantum gate. We show explicitly how
to perform universal computation on clusters of the four-qubit DFS encoding one
logical qubit each under ""collective decoherence"" (qubit-permutation-invariant
system-bath coupling). Our results have immediate relevance to a number of
solid-state quantum computer implementations, in particular those in which
