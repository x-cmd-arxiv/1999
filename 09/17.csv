Several successes and failures of ``anthropic'' reasoning in this context are
reviewed in the light of recent developments in astrobiology, cosmology and
unification physics. Specific issues raised include our spacetime location
(including the reason for the present age of the universe), the timescale of
biological evolution, the tuning of global cosmological parameters, and the
origin of the Large Numbers of astrophysics and the parameters of the Standard
Model. Out of the twenty parameters of the Standard Model, the basic behavior
and structures of the world (nucleons, nuclei, atoms, molecules, planets,
stars, galaxies) depend mainly on five of them: $m_e,m_u,m_d,\alpha,$ and
$\alpha_G$ (where $m_{proton}$ and $\alpha_{QCD}$ are taken as defined
quantities). Three of these appear to be independent in the context of Grand
Unified Theories (that is, not fixed by any known symmetry) and at the same
time have values within a very narrow window which provides for stable nucleons
and nuclei and abundant carbon. The conjecture is made that the two light quark
masses and one coupling constant are ultimately determined even in the ``Final
Theory'' by a choice from a large or continuous ensemble, and the prediction is
offered that the correct unification scheme will not allow calculation of
$(m_d-m_u)/m_{proton}$ from first principles alone.

  Constraints from the Tully-Fisher Relation","20 pages, 10 figures. Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1086/308337",,"astro-ph",,"  We present new semi-analytical models for the formation of disk galaxies with
the purpose of investigating the origin of the near-infrared Tully-Fisher (TF)
relation. The models assume that disks are formed by cooling of the baryons
inside dark halos with realistic density profiles, and that the baryons
conserve their specific angular momentum. Only gas with densities above the
critical density given by Toomre's stability criterion is considered eligible
for star formation, and a simple recipe for supernovae feedback is included. We
emphasize the importance of extracting the proper luminosity and velocity
measures from the models, something that has often been ignored in the past.
The observed K-band TF relation has a slope that is steeper than simple
predictions based on dynamical arguments suggest. Taking the stability related
star formation threshold densities into account steepens the TF relation,
decreases its scatter, and yields gas mass fractions that are in excellent
agreement with observations. In order for the TF slope to be as steep as
observed, further physics are required. We argue that the characteristics of
the observed near-infrared TF relation do not reflect systematic variations in
stellar populations, or cosmological initial conditions, but are governed by
feedback. Finally we show that our models provide a natural explanation for the
small amount of scatter that makes the TF relation useful as a cosmological
distance indicator.

Ramirez-Ruiz (Los Alamos)","Gamma-Ray Bursts as Internal Shocks Caused By Deceleration","19 pages, 5 embedded figures, Latex, Submitted to ApJ",,,"LA-UR 99-3736","astro-ph",,"  Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been thought to originate from internal shocks
that occur about 10^{15} cm from a central site. The shells responsible for
these shocks merge together and undergo an external shock at about 10^{17} cm,
producing the afterglows. We include deceleration in our model of internal
shocks and find that, for values of the Lorentz factor greater than 10^3,
deceleration is an effective catalyst for converting the bulk motion energy
into radiation during the GRB phase. Substantial internal energy occurs because
other shells run into the back of the first shell which has decelerated and
because the first shell must energize the interstellar medium. Whereas internal
shocks without deceleration are about 25% efficient, we can convert up to 85%
of the bulk motion energy during the GRB phase. We demonstrate that the
resulting time history can have three components. The first is due to internal
shocks, excluding those that involve the first shell. This component produces
narrow peaks throughout the time history. The second is due to internal shocks
involving the first shell, and it produces progressively wider and wider peaks
but they tend to be hidden in a slowly varying background in the event. The
third component is from energizing the interstellar medium. It is very smooth
and may contribute mostly to a lower energy bandpass than the BATSE experiment.
There have been claims of upper limits on the possible Lorentz factor because
the deceleration must occur at greater radii than the internal shocks to avoid
making progressively wider peaks. We do not find this to be the case, and the
Lorentz factor (and efficiency) can be much larger.

techniques used in astrophysical observations, following the theory of model
parameter estimation. It is applied to compare two-aperture optical long
baseline interferometry to classical spectroscopy, both used to define the
model parameters of the P Cyg wind. The wind modeling was done using an
efficient approximation for computation of the line source function; it allowed
to analyse about 10e5 points in the parametric space of P Cyg envelope models.
It is shown that interferometry offers no real advantage if the object can be
described by stationary spherically symmetric models with a priori fixed
thermal structure. However, if the object must be described by a model with a
large number of free parameters, e.g. when the thermal structure of the
envelope is not fixed a priori, then the interferometric measurements can
reduce the error in model parameters determination by an order of magnitude. In
the case of P Cyg, the reduction of errors provided by interferometry is
highest for the baseline lengths in the range 45--90 m. This illustrates the
capacity of the proposed method to be used for optimization of interferometric
configurations. The simplifications adopted for this first trial application
are critically analyzed, and future improvements are indicated.

We demonstrate that, if an income flow is constant, a space periodicity takes

Hence, grains are piling layer by layer. The thickness of the layers is
proportional to the input flow of particles $r_0$ and coincides with the
thickness of stratified layers in a two-component sandpile problem which were
observed recently. We find that the surface angle $\theta$ of the pile reaches
its final critical value ($\theta_f$) only at long times after a complicated
relaxation process. The deviation ($\theta_f - \theta $) behaves asymptotically
as $(t/r_{0})^{-1/2}$. It appears that the pile evolution depends on initial

We first demonstrate that, in the presence of gravity, the granular density
crosses over from Boltzmann to Fermi statistics, when temperature is decreased
in the weak excitation limit. Comparisons of numerical simulations with our
predictions concerning the scaling behavior of temperature with agitation
frequency, gravity and particle-diameter show satisfying agreement. Next,
within the framework of the Enskog theory of hard spheres, we interpret this
crossover as a 'condensation' of hard spheres from the dilute gas-state to a
high density solid-like state. In the high density, low temperature limit
Enskog theory fails because it predicts densities larger than the closed packed
density below a certain temperature. We show how to extend the range of
applicability of the Enskoq theory to arbitrarily low temperatures by
constructing a physical solution: all particles that are situated in regions
with densities larger than a certain maximum density are assumed to be
'condensed.'

two-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity under coupling to a conformal field
theory with c>1. This is done by analyzing numerically a system of eight Ising
models (corresponding to c=4) coupled to dynamically triangulated Lorentzian
geometries. It is known that a single Ising model couples weakly to Lorentzian
quantum gravity, in the sense that the Hausdorff dimension of the ensemble of
two-geometries is two (as in pure Lorentzian quantum gravity) and the matter
behaviour is governed by the Onsager exponents. By increasing the amount of
matter to 8 Ising models, we find that the geometry of the combined system has
undergone a phase transition. The new phase is characterized by an anomalous
scaling of spatial length relative to proper time at large distances, and as a
consequence the Hausdorff dimension is now three. In spite of this qualitative
change in the geometric sector, and a very strong interaction between matter
and geometry, the critical exponents of the Ising model retain their Onsager
values. This provides evidence for the conjecture that the KPZ values of the
critical exponents in 2d Euclidean quantum gravity are entirely due to the
presence of baby universes. Lastly, we summarize the lessons learned so far

Euclidean space. In particular the quantization of the pure gauge model in a
common class of covariant gauges is performed. We generalize the pure gauge
sector by including matter fermions in the adjoint representation of the gauge
group and analyze its N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric extensions. We show that the
maximum half-integer spin contained in these fermion fields in dimension 4 is

it is a simple example of the so-called conformal affine Toda theories coupled

probability the scaling exponents outperform the variance measure. Our risk
study is based on a database containing recordings from 428 individuals after

magnetic fields, transitions between the $lm$ sub-levels of fast $\mu He^+$
ions formating in muon catalyzed fusion. Strong fields also cause the
self-ionization from highly excited states of such muonic ions. Both effects
are the consequence of the interaction of the bound muon with the oscillating
field of the Stark term coupling the center-of-mass and muon motions of the
$\mu He^+$ ion due to the non-separability of the collective and internal
variables in this system. The performed calculations show a possibility to
drive the population of the $lm$ sub-levels by applying a field of a few
$Tesla$, which affects the reactivation rate and is especially important to the
$K\alpha$ $x$-ray production in muon catalyzed fusion. It is also shown that
the $2s-2p$ splitting in $\mu He^+$ due to the vacuum polarization slightly
decreases the stimulated transition rates.

electronic configurations which belong to three groups with different spin

from the field-free 1s^2 2s^2 2p_0 2p_{-1}, S_z=-1 configuration. With
increasing field strength the ground state involves the four S_z=-2
configurations 1s^22s2p_0 2p_{-1}2p_{+1}, 1s^22s2p_0 2p_{-1}3d_{-2}, 1s^22p_0

prepared copies of the system. The method is versatile and can be applied to
multimode radiation fields as well as to spin systems. The incorporation of
physical constraints, which is natural in the maximum-likelihood strategy,
leads to a substantial reduction of statistical errors. Numerical
implementation of the method is based on a particular form of the Gauss
decomposition for positive definite Hermitian matrices.
