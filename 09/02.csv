of GRB 970228 and GRB 980326 appear to contain a SN component, in addition to a
relativistic shock wave component, provide direct clues that at least the long
GRBs detected by BeppoSAX are a result of the collapse of massive stars. We
show that, if this is indeed the case, GRBs and their afterglows provide a
powerful probe of the very high redshift (VHR) (z > 5) universe. We first
establish that GRBs and their afterglows are both detectable out to VHRs. We
then show that one expects GRBs to occur out to at least z ~ 10 and possibly z
\~ 15 - 20, redshifts that are far larger than those expected for the most
distant quasars. This implies that there are large numbers of GRBs with peak
photon number fluxes below the detection thresholds of BATSE and HETE-2, and
even below the detection threshold of Swift. The mere detection of VHR GRBs
would give us our first information about the earliest generations of stars. We
show that GRBs and their afterglows can be used as beacons to locate core
collapse SNe at redshifts z >> 1, and to study the properties of these SNe. We
describe the expected properties of the absorption-line systems and the
Ly-alpha forest in the spectra of GRB afterglows, and discuss various
strategies for determining the redshifts of VHR GRBs. We then show how the
absorption-line systems and the Ly-alpha forest visible in the spectra of GRB
afterglows can be used to trace the evolution of metallicity in the universe,
and to probe the large-scale structure of the universe at VHRs. Finally, we
show how measurement of the Ly-alpha break in the spectra of GRB afterglows can
be used to constrain, or possibly measure, the epoch at which re-ionization of
the universe occurred, using the Gunn-Peterson test.

with the rotational velocities of their spiral galaxies and internal velocity
dispersions of their early types.
  A detailed study of the low velocity dispersion group, HCG 16 -- the only
known group of late-type galaxies with diffuse intergalactic X-ray emitting hot
gas -- reveals that half of the diffuse X rays are associated with
foreground/background sources and the remaining gas is clumpy and mostly
associated with the bright galaxies of the group. The large-scale environment
of the group suggests that HCG 16 lies where a cosmological filament falls
perpendicularly onto a large-scale sheet.
  The observed frequency of compact groups is lower than predicted from the
extended Press-Schechter formalism, which also predicts that most 10^13 Msun
objects in the Universe must be fairly old and hence have already coalesced
into single objects, reminiscent of elliptical galaxies over-luminous in X-rays
that are now being discovered.
  Thus, the low survival time of dense groups against the merging instability
is no longer a worry for compact groups, as they form in large enough numbers.
I show why other arguments against the reality of HCGs no longer hold, partly
because of the biases of Hickson's sample.

transport of the cosmic rays. We normalize the LiBeB production to the integral
energy imparted to cosmic rays per supernova. Models in which the cosmic rays
are accelerated mainly out of the average ISM significantly under predict the
measured Be abundance of the early Galaxy, the increase in [O/Fe] with
decreasing [Fe/H] notwithstanding. We suggest that this increase could be due
to the delayed mixing of the Fe. But, if the cosmic-ray metals are accelerated
out of supernova ejecta enriched superbubbles, the measured Be abundances are
consistent with a cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency that is in very good

the emission lines are detected, centered mostly at $\sim$5.7 keV and $\sim$7.7
keV, respectively, while the line energies exhibit random variability $\sim$5%.
Interestingly, the lines move in a concerted manner to keep their separation
roughly constant. The lines also vary greatly in strength, but with the
lower-energy line always much stronger than the higher-energy one. The measured
equivalent width ranges from $\sim$50 eV to $\sim$270 eV for the former, and
from insignificant detection to $\sim$140 eV for the latter; the two are
reasonably correlated.
  The correlation between the lines implies a causal connection --- perhaps
they share a common origin. Both lines may arise from a single $K_{\alpha}$
line of highly ionized iron that is Doppler-shifted either in a Keplerian
accretion disk or in a bi-polar outflow or even both. In both scenarios, a
change in the line energy might simply reflect a change in the ionization state

extended source coincident with the afterglow. Taking into account our
measurement of the extinction toward this field, this color implies that the
extended source is most likely a galaxy undergoing star formation, in agreement
with our earlier conclusion (\cite{CL98}). In a separate analysis, we find that
the inferred intrinsic spectrum of the GRB 980329 afterglow is consistent with
the predictions of the simplest relativistic fireball model. We also find that
the intrinsic spectrum of the afterglow is extincted both by dust (source frame
$A_V \ga 1$ mag), and that the shape of the extinction curve is typical of
young star-forming regions like the Orion Nebula but is not typical of older

the object-weighted statistical method of Davis, Miller, & White (1997) to the
Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS), which is the largest and deepest existing
redshift survey that is nearly fully sampled. The derived one-dimensional
dispersion on scales ~ 1 Mpc/h is quite low: sigma_1 = 126 +/- 10 km/s, with a
modest decrease at larger scales. The statistic is very stable; the six
independent slices of the LCRS all yield consistent results. We apply the same
statistical procedure to halos in numerical simulations of an open cosmological
model and flat models with and without a cosmological constant. In contrast to
the LCRS, all the models show a dispersion which increases for scales > 1
Mpc/h; it is uncertain whether this is a numerical artifact or a real physical
effect. The standard cluster-normalized Cold Dark Matter model with Omega_m = 1
as well as a tilted variant with n = 0.8 yield dispersions substantially hotter
than the LCRS value, while models with low matter density (Omega_m = 0.3) are
broadly consistent with the LCRS data. Using a filtered cosmic energy equation,

fluids in $2\frac{1}{2}$-dimensions, extending our previous work by Frank et al
(1996) and Jones \etal (1997). In the present work we have simulated flows in
the x-y plane in which a ``sheared'' magnetic field of uniform strength
``smoothly'' rotates across a thin velocity shear layer from the z direction to
the x direction, aligned with the flow field. We focus on dynamical evolution
of fluid features, kinetic energy dissipation, and mixing of the fluid between
the two layers, considering their dependence on magnetic field strength for
this geometry. The introduction of magnetic shear can allow a Cat's Eye-like
vortex to form, even when the field is stronger than the nominal linear
instability limit given above. For strong fields that vortex is asymmetric with
respect to the preliminary shear layer, however, so the subsequent dissipation
is enhanced over the uniform field cases of comparable field strength. In fact,
so long as the magnetic field achieves some level of dynamical importance
during an eddy turnover time, the asymmetries introduced through the magnetic
shear will increase flow complexity, and, with that, dissipation and mixing.
The degree of the fluid mixing between the two layers is strongly influenced by
the magnetic field strength. Mixing of the fluid is most effective when the
vortex is disrupted by magnetic tension during transient reconnection, through
local chaotic behavior that follows.

disk form, and a strong gamma-ray burst (GRB) results. However, there may also
be more frequently realized cases where the black hole forms after a delay of
from several tens of seconds to several hours as approximately 0.1 to 5 solar
masses falls back into the collapsed remnant following a mildly successful
supernova explosion. There, the same MHD mechanisms frequently invoked to
produce GRBs would also produce jets in stars already in the process of
exploding. The presupernova star could be a Wolf-Rayet star or a red or blue
supergiant. Depending upon its initial pressure, the collimation of the jet may
also vary since ``hot'' jets will tend to diverge and share their energy with
the rest of the star. From these situations, one expects diverse outcomes
ranging from GRBs with a large range of energies and durations, to asymmetric,
energetic supernovae with weak GRBs. SN 1998bw may have been the explosion of a
star in which fall back produced a black hole and a less collimated jet than in
the case of prompt black hole formation.

the energy are different from those on the Sun. Magnetic coupling between the

the plasma was confined to Algol B, and reached a maximum height of 0.6 stellar
radii above its surface. The flare occurred around the south pole of Algol B,

that a specific extrastellar environment is not required for the presence of a

instruments, together with the long decay time scale of the flare, allowed us
to perform a detailed time-resolved X-ray spectroscopic analysis of the flare.
We derive the physical parameters of the emitting region together with the
plasma density applying different methods to the observed flare decay. The
X-ray emission from the flare is totally eclipsed during the secondary optical
eclipse, so that the size of the emitting region is strongly constrained (as
described in a companion paper) on purely geometrical arguments. The size of
the flare thus derived is much smaller than the size derived from the analysis
of the evolution of the spectral parameters using the quasi-static cooling
formalism, showing that the time evolution of the flare is determined
essentially from the temporal profile of the heating, with the intrinsic decay
of the flaring loop having little relevance. The very high signal-to-noise of
the individual spectra strongly constrains some of the derived physical
parameters. In particular, very significant evidence for a three-fold increase
in coronal abundance and for a large increase in absorbing column density
during the initial phases of the flare evolution is present.

is estimated to be 0.29+-0.05, which is significantly higher than the value for
the solar neighborhood. The high ratio is consistent with a hypothesis that the
dusts in the worms have been processed by interstellar shocks. The radio
continuum emission from the worm has a spectral index of -0.47 and does not
correlate with I_60. Thus, most of the radio continuum emission is likely to be
nonthermal. Our HI observations show that the HI gas is clumpy. We detected two
molecular clouds associated with the HI peaks. The molecular clouds do not
appear to be gravitationally bound. Using the Leiden-Dwingeloo HI data, we
identify an expanding HI supershell associated with GW46.4+5.5, which is a size
of 14^o*22^o. The supershell appears between 18 and 40 km/s, and decreases
slowly in size as the velocity increases. An averaged l-v diagram reveals that
the supershell has a central velocity of ~18 km/s (d_kin=1.4 kpc) and an
expansion velocity of ~15 km/s. The structure is also visible in adio continuum
maps. The observed molecular clouds might have condensed out of
shock-compressed gas in GW46.4+5.5 because they are closely associated with the
HI gas in velocity as well as in position. Their altitudes are 80 and 100 pc,
respectively, and their physical properties are very similar to those of the
high-altitude clouds. Our results suggest that at least some of the
high-altitude clouds might have formed in Galactic worms (or HI supershells).

beamed. There is a possibility that some SN ejecta are also beamed and/or
relativistic. Prospects for farther advances guided by expected and unexpected
observational developments are very good. The prospects for developing a sound
and quantitative GRB theory any time soon are rather modest, if histories of
quasars, radio pulsars and supernovae are used for reference. However, the
current progress in the understanding of GRB afterglows (which are
relativistic) and remnants (which are non-relativistic) is likely to continue,
as these appear to be simpler than the GRBs.
  According to the current analysis of GRB 970508 the energy of gamma rays
released by this event was about the same as the total energy of explosion. If
correct, this result is difficult to reconcile with the internal shock models.
It also implies that the global energy generation rate by GRBs is four orders
of magnitude lower than the rate due to ordinary supernovae, which makes it
very unlikely that the highly energetic supernova remnants were created by
GRBs.

the star is under-luminous by almost three magnitudes. Its position in the

post-AGB or post-EHB object, although if it has evolved via single star
evolution from a high mass (7.6-9.0 solar masses) progenitor then we might
expect it to have a much higher mass, $\sim0.9\Msun$. Alternatively, it has
evolved in a close binary. In this case the object offers no implications for

equation of state near saturation density is nearly the same in both models.
While the Walecka-type model predicts a strange star core with strangeness
fraction $f_S \approx 4/3$, the chiral model allows only for $f_S \approx 1/3$
and predicts that $\Sigma^0$, $\Sigma^+$ and $\Xi^0$ will not exist in star, in

$\rho_{Iv}$ is the Ivantsov tip radius of an isothermal paraboloid with the
same tip velocity and $\alpha$ is the stiffness anisotropy). The universal tip
shape, which excludes this distortion, is well fitted by the form $z=-r^2/2+A_4
r^4\cos 4\phi$ where $|z|$ is the distance from the tip and all lengths are
scaled by $\rho_{Iv}$. This fit yields $A_4$ in the range $0.004-0.005$ in good

through the D- and F-flatness conditions of the superpotential. We derive the
general solutions to the anomaly cancellation conditions and show that they
allow numerous choices for the U(1)_X fermion charges which give several
fermion mass textures in agreement with the observed fermion mass hierarchy and
mixing. Solutions with U(1)_X fermion charge assignments are found which forbid

(\mu-term) can be fixed at the electroweak level. We give a general
classification of the fermion mass textures with respect to the sum of the

operators naturally occurs for various charge assignments. We work out cases
which retain a quartic term providing the left-handed neutrinos with Majorana
masses in the absence of right-handed neutrino components and consistent with
the experimental bounds. Although there exist solutions which naturally combine
all the above features with rather natural U(1)_X charges, the suppression of

one previously derived. We also comment on implications of the mentioned
uncertainties for experiments of indirect dark matter detection.

dilepton measurements in (ultra-) relativistic heavy-ion experiments is
reviewed. Special emphasis is put on potential signals of (partial) restoration
of dynamically broken chiral symmetry in a hot and dense hadronic medium. It
follows from chiral symmetry alone that parity partners of hadronic correlation
functions must become identical when the symmetry is restored. The assessment
of medium effects in the vector channel, which governs the dilepton production,
thus necessitates a simultaneous treatment of the vector and axialvector
degrees of freedom. While significant progress in this respect has been made
some open questions remain in establishing a rigorous link in the mass region
below 1 GeV. From the present calculations a suggestive 'quark-hadron duality'
emerges near the phase boundary. It implies substantial medium effects in the
dilepton signal from the hadronic phase which smoothly matches a perturbative
description within the plasma phase.

perturbation theory. The relation to non-perturbative physics is obtained by
expressing the theory on a lattice, a la Wilson. The new fields that must be
introduced in the context of a topological Yang-Mills theory have a simple
lattice expression. We present a 5-dimensional critical limit for physical
correlation functions and for dynamical auto-correlations, which allows new
Monte-Carlo algorithm based on the time-step in lattice units given by $\e =
g_0^{-13/11}$ in pure gluodynamics. The gauge-fixing in five dimensions is such
that no Gribov ambiguity occurs. The weight is strictly positive, because all

totally asymmetric one-dimensional interacting system. The model we take as
example is Hammersley's process as seen from a tagged particle, which can be
viewed as a process of interacting positive-valued stick heights on the sites
of Z. It is known that under Euler scaling (space and time scale n) the
empirical stick profile obeys the Burgers equation. We refine this result in
two ways: If the process starts close enough to equilibrium, then over times
n^\nu for 1\le\nu<3, and up to errors that vanish in hydrodynamic scale, the
dynamics merely translates the initial stick configuration. A time evolution
for the perturbation is visible under a particular family of scalings: over
times n^\nu, 1<\nu<3/2, a perturbation of order n^(1-\nu) from equilibrium
follows the inviscid Burgers equation. The results for the stick model are
derived from asymptotic results for tagged particles in Hammersley's process.

mirror symmetry conjecture. Roughly put, the SYZ conjecture suggests that
mirror pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds are related by the existence of dual
special Lagrangian torus fibrations. We explore this conjecture without
reference to the special Lagrangian condition. In this setting, natural
questions include: does there exist a nice class of T^3-fibrations for which
the dual fibration can be constructed? Do such fibrations exist on a manifold
such as the quintic threefold? If so, is the dual fibration the mirror?
  We answer these questions affirmatively. We introduce a class of topological
T^3-fibrations for which duals can be constructed, including over the singular
fibres. We then construct such a fibration on the quintic threefold, and show
that by applying this general dualizing construction to this particular case,
one obtains the mirror quintic. Thus we have constructed the mirror quintic
topologically with no a priori knowledge of the mirror. This shows that in a
non-degenerate (and representative) case, the Strominger-Yau-Zaslow conjecture
correctly explains mirror symmetry.

rotational motion of the ferromagnetic grains relative to the viscous flow of

mesoscopic treatment of the particle motion to derive a relaxation equation for

approach of Liu involves only macroscopic quantities and results in dissipative
Maxwell equations for the magnetic fields in the ferrofluid. Different stress
tensors and constitutive equations lead to deviating theoretical predictions in
those situations, where the magnetic relaxation processes cannot be considered
instantaneous on the hydrodynamic time scale. We quantify these differences for
two situations of experimental relevance namely a resting fluid in an
oscillating oblique field and the damping of parametrically excited surface
waves. The possibilities of an experimental differentiation between the two

linear basis to approximate stress) leads to greater efficiency in enhanced
strain problems, is presented. An Airy stress function and the consequent
selective simplification resulting from the differentiation of an implied,
single, parent approximating polynomial, are the essence of this argument.

quantum apparatus (harmonic oscillator) which in turn is coupled to a bath of
harmonic oscillators. Exact solutions of the Markovian Master equation show
that the reduced density matrix of the system-apparatus combine decoheres to a
statistical mixture where up and down spins eventually correlate with pointer
states of the apparatus. For the zero temperature bath these pointer states
turn out to be coherent states of the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary initial
states of the apparatus. For a high temperature bath pointer states are
Gaussian distributions (generalized coherent states). For both cases, the
off-diagonal elements in spin-space decohere over a time scale which goes
inversely as the square of the ""separation"" between the ""pointers"". Our exact
results also demonstrate in an unambiguous way that the pointer states in this
measurement model emerge independent of the initial state of the apparatus.

vacuum states is presented. The states are squeezed in one of two field
quadrature components, and the value of the squeezed component is used to
encode a character from an alphabet. The uncertainty relation between
quadrature components prevents an eavesdropper from determining both with
enough precision to determine the character being sent. Losses degrade the
performance of this scheme, but it is possible to use phase-sensitive
amplifiers to boost the signal and partially compensate for their effect.

analyzed within the realistic model of particle propagation. In a step by step
procedure we show that all current models of interference are essentially
non-local and demonstrate that the treatment of the quantum theory of motion is
the simplest model for the scalar problem. In particular we give a novel
interpretation of the quantum potential Q, which should be regarded as a
non-classical and essentially statistical term describing the changes of the
quantum ensemble due to a change of the physical environment.

time. In reality however, the switching-on of the measuring device at the
instance of the measurement requires a timing device. Hence the classical time
$t$ must be replaced by a suitable quantum time variable $\tau$ of a physical
clock. The main issue raised in this article is that while doing so, we can no
longer neglect the {\em back-reaction} due to the measurement on the clock.
This back-reaction yields a bound on the accuracy of the measurement. When this
bound is violated the result of a measurement is generally not an eigenvalue of
the observable, and furthermore, the state of the system after the measurement
is generally not a pure state. We argue that as a consequence, a sub-class of
observables in a closed system cannot be realized by a measurement.
