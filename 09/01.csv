needed for maintaining the blood flow through the vessels at required level.
The second one is the principle of minimal drag and lumen volume.
Characteristic features of these principles are considered. An alternative
approach leading to Murray's law has been proposed. For that we model the
microcirculatory bed in terms of delivering vascular network with symmetrical
bifurcation nodes, embedded uniformly into the cellular tissue. It was shown
that Murray's law can be regarded as a direct consequence of the organism
capacity for controlling the blood flow redistribution over the

using data from the Magellanic Clouds Photometric Survey, which provides
4-filter photometry for millions of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We
find that visual extinctions are typically larger by several tenths of a
magnitude for stars with effective temperatures > 12000 K, than for stars with
effective temperatures between 5500 K and 6500 K. Several repercussions of this
population-dependent extinction are discussed. In particular, LMC distance
measurements that utilize old stellar populations (such as red clump stars),
but use extinctions derived from OB stars, may be biased low.
Population-dependent extinction affects the interpretation of color-magnitude
diagrams and results in an effective absorption law that is steeper than that
intrinsic to the dust for unresolved stellar systems. We further explore the
relation between the stellar populations and dust by comparing our extinction
map to the 100mu image of the region and identifying potential heating sources
of the dust. We conclude that 100mu flux should be used with caution as a star
formation tracer, particularly for studies of star formation within galaxies.
Finally, we reproduce the observed extinction variation between the hot and
cold stellar populations with a simple model of the distribution of the stars
and dust where the scaleheight of the cooler stars is >> than that of the dust
(which is twice that of the OB stars). (Abridged Abstract)

sounding rocket. In contrast to previous experiments which have detected a halo
around NGC 5907 in the V, R, I, J and K bands at galactic radii 6kpc < r <
10kpc, our search finds no evidence for emission from a halo at 10kpc < r <
30kpc. Assuming a halo mass density scaling as r^(-2), which is consistent with
the flat rotation curves that are observed out to radii of 32kpc, the lower
limit of the mass-to-light ratio at 3.5-5 microns for the halo of NGC 5907 is
250 (2 sigma) in solar units. This is comparable to the lower limit we have
found previously for NGC 4565 (Uemizu et al. 1998). Based on recent models, our
non-detection implies that hydrogen- burning stars contribute < 15% of the mass
of the dark halo of NGC 5907. Our results are consistent with the previous
detection of extended emission at r < 10kpc if the latter is caused by a
stellar population that has been ejected from the disk because of tidal

rotation curves that extend far beyond 10kpc, is not comprised of hydrogen

influence of the steady Galactic tidal field, including the effects of velocity
anisotropy. Similar to single-mass models, velocity anisotropy develops as the
cluster evolves, but the degree of anisotropy is much smaller than isolated
clusters. Except for very early epochs of the cluster evolution, nearly all
mass components become tangentially anisotropic at the outer parts. We have
compared our results with multi-mass, King-Michie models. The isotropic King
model better fits to the Fokker-Planck results because of tangential
anisotropy. However, it is almost impossible to fit the computed density
profiles to the multi-mass King models for all mass components. Thus if one
attempts to derive global mass function based on the observed mass function in
limited radial range using multi-mass King models, one may get somewhat erratic
results, especially for low mass stars. We have examined how the mass function
changes in time. Specifically, we find that the power-law index of the mass
function decreases monotonically with the total mass of the cluster. This
appears to be consistent with the behaviour of the observed slopes of mass
functions for a limited number of clusters, although it is premature to compare
quantitatively because there are other mechanisms in contributing the
evaporation of stars from the clusters. The projected velocity profiles for
anisotropic models with the apocenter criterion for evaporation show
significant flattening toward the tidal radius compared to isotropic model or
anisotropic model with the energy criterion. Such a behaviour of velocity
profile appears to be consistent with the observed profiles of collapsed
cluster M15.

alpha data, fully sampled and at sub-arcsecond resolution, show a rotation
curve that is rapidly rising in the central ~140 pc, and stays roughly
constant, at the main disk value, further out. Non-circular motions are studied
from the H alpha and CO data by detailed consideration of the velocity fields,
residual velocity fields after subtraction of the rotation curve, and sets of
position-velocity diagrams. These motions are interpreted as the kinematic
signatures of gas streaming along the inner part of the bar, and of density
wave streaming motions across a two-armed mini-spiral. Comparison with a
two-dimensional velocity field and rotation curve derived from our 1995
dynamical model shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement for the
circular and non-circular kinematic components. Both morphology and kinematics
of this region require the presence of a double inner Lindblad Resonance in
order to explain the observed twisting of the near-infrared isophotes and the
gas velocity field. These are compatible with the presence of a global density
wave driven by the moderately strong stellar bar in this galaxy. We review

is ejected at a relativistic velocity, and internal collisions within this
ejecta produce the observed $\gamma$-ray flash. The angular size of a causally
connected region within a relativistic flow is of the order the angular width
of the relativistic beaming, $\gamma^{-1}$. Thus, different observers along
different lines of sights could see drastically different fluxes from the same
burst. Specifically, we propose that the most energetic bursts correspond to
exceptionally bright spots along the line of sight on colliding shells, and do
not represent much larger energy release in the explosion. We calculate the
distribution function of the observed fluence for random angular-fluctuation of
ejecta. We find that the width of the distribution function for the observed
fluence is about two orders of magnitude if the number of shells ejected along
different lines of sight is ten or less. The distribution function becomes
narrower if number of shells along typical lines of sight increases. The
analysis of the $\gamma$-ray fluence and afterglow emissions for GRBs with
known redshifts provides support for our model i.e. the large width of GRB
luminosity function is not due to a large spread in the energy release but
instead is due to large angular fluctuations in ejected material. We outline
several observational tests of this model. In particular, we predict little
correlation between the $\gamma$-ray fluence and the afterglow emission as in
fact is observed. We predict that the early (minutes to hours) afterglow would
depict large temporal fluctuations whose amplitude decreases with time. Finally
we predict that there should be many weak bursts with about average afterglow
luminosity in this scenario.

reinforcement-learning dynamics where the reinforcement, for each of their

derive the exact solution of the model in the ``thermodynamic'' limit of
infinitely many agents using tools of statistical physics of disordered

key role: even though price has a weak dependence on the behavior of each
individual agent, the collective behavior crucially depends on whether agents
account for such dependence or not. Remarkably, if the adaptive behavior of
agents accounts even ``infinitesimally'' for this dependence they can, in a
whole range of parameters, reduce global fluctuations by a finite amount. Both
global efficiency and individual utility improve with respect to a ``price

generate the required gauge hierarchy without the need for hierarchically large
extra spacetime dimensions. In this paper, we show that gauge coupling
unification arises naturally in such scenarios as a result of the anomaly
induced by the rescaling of the wavefunctions of the brane fields. Thus,
``anomaly-induced'' gauge coupling unification can easily explain the apparent
low-energy gauge couplings in gravity-localized compactifications. However, we
also point out a number of phenomenological difficulties with such
compactifications, including an inability to accommodate the GUT scale and the
electroweak scale simultaneously. We also show that brane/bulk couplings in
this scenario are generically too small to be phenomenologically relevant.
Finally, we speculate on possible resolutions to these puzzles.

of commutative rings are limited to maps that are essentially of finite type,
or flat. The concept introduced in this paper is meaningful for homomorphisms
phi : R \longrightarrow S of commutative noetherian rings. It is defined in
terms of the structure of phi in a formal neighborhood of each point of Spec S.
We characterize the l.c.i. property by different conditions on the vanishing of
the Andr\'e-Quillen homology of the R-algebra S. One of these descriptions
establishes a very general form of a conjecture of Quillen that was open even
for homomorphisms of finite type: If S has a finite resolution by flat
R-modules and the cotangent complex \cot SR is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded
complex of flat S-modules, then phi is l.c.i. The proof uses a mixture of
methods from commutative algebra, differential graded homological algebra, and
homotopy theory. The l.c.i. property is shown to be stable under a variety of
operations, including composition, decomposition, flat base change,
localization, and completion. The present framework allows for the results to
be stated in proper generality; many of them are new even with classical
assumptions. For instance, the stability of l.c.i. homomorphisms under
decomposition settles an open case in Fulton's treatment of orientations of
morphisms of schemes.

Notice that a hyperbolic periodic point is always transversal, but not vice

(2) 150 (1999), no. 2, 369-453",,"Annals migration 4-2001","math.CA math.DG",,"  One of the basic aims of this paper is to study the relationship between the
geometry of ``hypersurface like'' subsets of Euclidean space and the properties
of the measures they support. In this context we show that certain doubling
properties of a measure determine the geometry of its support. A Radon measure
is said to be doubling with constant C if C times the measure of the ball of
radius r centered on the support is greater than the measure of the ball of
radius 2r and the same center. We prove that if the doubling constant of a
measure on \R^{n+1} is close to the doubling constant of the n-dimensional
Lebesgue measure then its support is well approximated by n-dimensional affine
spaces, provided that the support is relatively flat to start with. Primarily
we consider sets which are boundaries of domains in \R^{n+1}. The n-dimensional
Hausdorff measure may not be defined on the boundary of a domain in R^{n+1}.
Thus we turn our attention to the harmonic measure which is well behaved under
minor assumptions. We obtain a new characterization of locally flat domains in
terms of the doubling properties of their harmonic measure. Along these lines
we investigate how the ``weak'' regularity of the Poisson kernel of a domain
determines the geometry of its boundary.

(nonlinear dissipation in the absence of forcing and long-term stability under
conditions of time dependent loading), irrespective of the time increment
employed, is established in this work. These properties are intrinsic to real
flows and the conventional Navier-Stokes equations.
  A description of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid, which reconciles the
differences between the various schools of A.L.E. thought in the literature is
derived for the purposes of this investigation. The issue of whether these
equations automatically inherit the afore mentioned energetic properties must
first be resolved. In this way natural notions of nonlinear, exponential-type
dissipation in the absence of forcing and long-term stability under conditions
of time dependent loading are also formulated.
  The findings of this analysis have profound consequences for the use of
certain classes of finite difference schemes in the context of deforming
references. It is significant that many algorithms presently in use do not
automatically inherit the fundamental qualitative features of the dynamics.
  The main conclusions are drawn on in the simulation of a driven cavity flow,
a driven cavity flow with various, included rigid bodies, a die-swell problem,
and a Stokes second order wave. The improved, second order accuracy of a new
scheme for the linearised approximation of the convective term is proved for
the purposes of these simulations. A somewhat novel method to generate finite
element meshes automatically about included rigid bodies, and which involves
finite element mappings, is also described.
