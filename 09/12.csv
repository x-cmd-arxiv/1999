regime, both tunneling and Coulomb drag lead to a {\it negative}
transresistance R_{TR}, while in the {\it diffusive} regime the tunneling
opposes the drag and leads to a {\it positive} R_{TR}. If L is smaller than the
phase-breaking length, the tunneling leads to interference oscillations of the
resistance that are damped exponentially with L.

  From this configuration of coherent pairing states, I can describe both the
single electron properties and the low energy collective excitations in high

directly with respect to the coherent pairing states. While, the low-lying
quantum fluctuations associated with spin-wave and charge excitation can be
investigated from the path integral of the coherent pairing states.

embedded into insulator, is studied. We find, that the grains may be charged
due to the fluctuations of the surface energy of electron gas in grains, rather
than quantization of electron states. The higherst-occupied level in a grain
fluctuates within the range of order of charging energy below the overall
chemical potential. The system, called a gapless Hubbard insulator, has no
overall energy gap, while the transfer of an electron on finite distances costs
finite energy. The ionization energy is determined mostly by the intragrain
Coulomb repulsion, rather than a weak intergrain interaction, responsible for
the Coulomb gap.
  The hopping transport in the system is studied. The hopping energy is
determined by the charging energy. At low temperature the transport has gapless
character.

  Variations of the vector field and the projection tensor in the general case
  and under definite assumptions","31 pages, Latex, no figures",,,,"gr-qc",,"  The purpose of the paper is to develop further a projection variational
approach in relativistic hydrodynamics. The approach, previously proposed in
[gr-qc/9908032], is based on the variation of the vector field and the
projection tensor (instead of the given metric tensor) and their first partial
derivatives. The previously proved property of non-commutativity of the
variation and the partial derivative in respect to the projection tensor has
been used to find all the variations. Subsequently, motivated by some analogy
with the well-known (3+1) ADM projection formalism, an assumption has been made
about a zero-covariant derivative of the projection tensor in respect to the
projection connection. The combination of the equations for the variations of
the projective tensor with covariant and contravariant indices has lead to the
derivation of an important and concisely written relation: the derivative of
the vector field length is equal to the ''twice'' projected along the vector
field initial Christoffell connection. The result is of interest due to the
following reasons: 1. It is a more general one and contains in itself a
well-known formulae in affine differential geometry for the so called
equiaffine connections (admitting covariantly conserved tensor fields), for
which the trace of the connection is equal to the gradient of the logarithm of
the vector field length. 2. The additional term is the projected (with the
projection tensor) initially given connection and accounts for the influence of
the reference system on the change of the vector field's length, measured in
this system. 3. The formulae has been obtained within the proposed formalism of
non-commuting variation and partial derivative.

In the MA gauge, the off-diagonal gluon behaves as the massive vector boson

gluon cannot carry the long-range interaction for $r \gg \Meff^{-1} \simeq 0.2$
fm. The essence of the infrared abelian dominance in the MA gauge is physically
explained with the generation of the off-diagonal gluon mass $\Meff \simeq 1.2
{\rm GeV}$ induced by the MA gauge fixing, and the off-diagonal gluon mass
generation would predict general infrared abelian dominance in QCD in the MA
gauge. We report also the off-diagonal gluon propagator at finite temperature.
