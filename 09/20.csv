one of the central problems in galactic astronomy and observational cosmology.
The most popular method to estimate the LF is maximum likelihood, which is
clearly understood with the concepts of the information theory. In the field of
information theory and statistical inference, great advance has been made by
the discovery of Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). It enables us to perform
a direct comparison among different types of models with different numbers of
parameters, and provides us a common basis of the model adequacy. In this paper
we applied AIC to the determination of the shape of the LF. We first treated
the estimation using stepwise LF, and derived a formula to obtain the optimal
bin number. In addition, we studied the method to compare the goodness-of-fit
of the parametric form with stepwise LF.

The median sampling interval during this period is about 1 hour, and the

quality and high maximum magnification of this event make it a prime candidate
to search for the short duration, low amplitude perturbations that are
signatures of a planetary companion orbiting the primary lens. The observed
light curve for \ob14 is consistent with a single lens (no companion) within
photometric uncertainties. We calculate the detection efficiency of the light
curve to lensing companions as a function of the mass ratio and angular
separation of the two components. We find that companions of mass ratio $\ge
0.01$ are ruled out at the 95% confidence level for projected separations
between $0.4-2.4 \re$, where $\re$ is the Einstein ring radius of the primary
lens. Assuming that the primary is a G-dwarf with $\re\sim3 {\rm AU}$ our
detection efficiency for this event is $\sim 60%$ for a companion with the mass

separation of Saturn. Our efficiencies for planets like those around Upsilon

radiation, the radiation emergent from atmospheres of neutron stars with strong
magnetic fields is expected to be strongly polarized. The degree of linear
polarization, typically ~10-30%, depends on photon energy, effective
temperature and magnetic field. The spectrum of polarization is more sensitive
to the magnetic field than the spectrum of intensity. Both the degree of
polarization and the position angle vary with the neutron star rotation period
so that the shape of polarization pulse profiles depends on the orientation of
the rotational and magnetic axes. Moreover, as the polarization is
substantially modified by the general relativistic effects, observations of
polarization of X-ray radiation from isolated neutron stars provide a new
method for evaluating the mass-to-radius ratio of these objects, which is

The geometry of ionized gas, IRAS sources, near-infrared sources, and molecular
cloud suggests that MR-1, an isolated early B-type star near Cloud 2, has
triggered the star formation activity in Cloud 2. Our results show that ongoing
star formation is present in Cloud 2 and that active star formation can occur
in the farthest regions of the Galaxy, where the molecular gas density is
extremely low, perturbation from the spiral arms is very small, and the
metallicity is similar to that for irregular dwarf galaxies. Cloud 2 is an
excellent laboratory in which to study the details of the star formation

the blueshifted gas is estimated to be 1.3--1.7, which is higher than the
statistical equilibrium value. This ratio provides us with evidence that the
NH3 molecules have been evaporated from dust grains with the formation
temperature between 18 and 25 K. It is most likely that the NH3 molecules on
dust grains have been released into the gas phase through the passage of strong
shock waves produced by the outflow. Such a scenario is supported by the fact
that the ammonia abundance in the blueshifted gas is enhanced by a factor of ~5

difference in luminosity, possibly due to a difference in mass, might exist
between field and cluster RR Lyraes, which could be responsible for the
well-known dichotomy between ""short"" and ""long"" distance scales. Preliminary
results are presented on the V and B-V light curves, the average apparent

planetary system provides a new window for the study of diffuse interstellar
matter. Dust particles observed by Ulysses and confirmed by Galileo are more
massive ($\geq 10^{-13} {\rm g}$) than the 'classical' interstellar grains.
Even bigger grains ($\approx 10^{-7} {\rm g}$) were observed in form of
interstellar meteors. We analyze the consequences of the plentiful existence of
massive grains in the diffuse interstellar medium. Astronomically observed
'classical' interstellar grains can be described by a size distribution ranging
from about 5 to 250 nm in radius (about $10^{-18}$ to $10^{-13} {\rm g}$).
Lifetimes of these particles, due to mutual collisions in interstellar space,
can be as short as $10^{5} f$ years, where f = 10 to 1000, is the fraction of
total lifetime to the time when grains are exposed to supernova shocks.
Shattering is a source of the smallest of these grains, but grains more massive
than about $10^{-16} {\rm g}$ of the classical interstellar grain population
are rapidly destroyed. When applying the same shattering mechanism to the more
massive grains found recently, we suggest that collisions of particles bigger
than about $10^{-15} {\rm g}$ provide a source for smaller grains. Because
massive grains couple to the interstellar gas only over large (100 to 1000 pc)
length scales, the cosmic abundance ratio of gas-to-dust needs only to be
preserved averaged over corresponding volumes of space.

  Using this approach, the phase boundaries are determined with high accuracy,
and then the structure of the phase diagram is clarified. At half-filling, the
phase diagram consists of two

these two transition lines are coupled in the strong-coupling region. This

lower than the critical value $\mu_{0}^\star \approx 0.4$, the dynamics is
dominated by occasional huge sandslides. For the range of values $\mu_{0}^\star

multifractal scaling properties of the slide distributions and continuously

emission. This is manifested in the fluorescent intensity as a function of the
detuning of the driving field from the two-photon resonance condition. Here we
present a theory which explains the observed variation of the number of peaks
with the mutual polarization of the molecular transition dipole moments. Using
master equation techniques we calculate analytically as well as numerically the
steady-state fluorescence, and find that the number of peaks depends on the
excitation process. If the molecule is driven to the upper levels by a
two-photon process, the fluorescent intensity consists of two peaks regardless
of the mutual polarization of the transition dipole moments. If the excitation
process is composed of both a two-step one-photon process and a one-step,
two-photon process, then there are two peaks on transitions with parallel
dipole moments and three peaks on transitions with antiparallel dipole moments.
This latter case is in excellent agreement with the experiment.

two lasers. We show that in the tripod scheme, there exist two population
trapping conditions; in some cases these conditions are easier to satisfy than
the single trapping condition in two-state LICS. Depending on the pulse timing,
various effects can be observed. We derive some basic properties of the tripod
scheme, such as the solution for coincident pulses, the behaviour of the system
in the adiabatic limit for delayed pulses, the conditions for no ionization and
for maximal ionization, and the optimal conditions for population transfer
between the discrete states via the continuum. In the case when one of the
discrete states is strongly coupled to the continuum, the population dynamics
reduces to a standard two-state LICS problem (involving the other two states)
with modified parameters; this provides the opportunity to customize the
