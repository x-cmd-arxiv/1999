photometric measurements, a significant fraction of all astronomical
photometry. We describe the calibration of MACHO two-color photometry and
transformation to the standard Kron-Cousins V and R system. Calibrated MACHO
photometry may be properly compared with all other observations on the
Kron-Cousins standard system, enhancing the astrophysical value of these data.
For 9 million stars in the LMC bar, independent photometric measurements of
20,000 stars with V < 18 mag in field-overlap regions demonstrate an internal
precision sigV = 0.021, sigR = 0.019, and sig(V-R) = 0.028 mag. The accuracy of
the zero-point in this calibration is estimated to be +-0.035 mag for stars
with colors in the range -0.1 < (V-R) < 1.2 mag. A comparison of calibrated
MACHO photometry with published photometric sequences and new Hubble Space

uncertainty for the remainder of the MACHO photometry database is estimated to

MCG-6-30-15, taken in July 1997. Our results show that the behaviour is
complicated. We find clear evidence from colour ratios and direct spectral
fitting that changes to the intrinsic photon index are taking place. Spectral
hardening is evident during periods of diminished intensity; in particular, a
general trend for harder spectra is seen in the period following the hardest
RXTE flare. Flux-correlated studies further show that the 3-10 keV photon index
steepens while that in the 10-20 keV band, flattens with flux. The largest
changes come from the spectral index below 10keV; however, changes in the
intrinsic power law slope, and reflection both contribute in varying degrees to
the overall spectral variability. We find that the iron line flux is consistent
with being constant over large time intervals on the order of days (although
the ASCA and RXTE spectra show that $F_{K\alpha}$ changes on shorter time
intervals of order < 10ks), and equivalent width which anticorrelates with the
continuum flux, and reflection fraction. Flux-correlated studies point at
possible ionization signatures, while detailed spectral analysis of short time
intervals surrounding flare events hint tentatively at observed spectral
responses to the flare. We present a simple model for partial ionization where
the bulk of the variability comes from within 6r_g. Temporal analysis further
provides evidence for possible time (< 1000s) and phase (phi~0.6 rad) lags.
Finally, we report an apparent break in the power density spectrum (~ 4-5 x

ongoing merger between a group sized sub-cluster and the main cluster. The
galaxy distribution shows two peaks connected in a barlike structure running NE
to SW through the central region of the main cluster, defining the merger axis.
The temperature of the intergalactic medium generally decreases from SW to NE
along the merger axis with a peak of 13.2 +3.4/-2.0 keV in a region which is
perpendicular to the merger axis and extends through the main cluster density
peak. The central bar has a velocity dispersion of ~1300 km/s, compared to
\~1000 km/s for the surrounding cluster. The central bar also has two distinct
density peaks in the distribution of galaxies, yet it has a velocity
distribution which is consistent with a single Gaussian. This implies a merger
in the plane of the sky. The optical and X-ray data taken together show that a
loose group of about ~30 galaxies has penetrated the main cluster from the SW,
decoupling from their original intergroup medium and passing through a strong
shock front. Two radio galaxies, one a wide angle tail morphology (WAT) and the
other a narrow angle tail (NAT), are located to the SW of the main cluster in
the post-shock gas. Since the merger is in the plane of the sky, a dynamical
analysis cannot be applied to derive the velocity of the merger. Alternatively,
using the pre- and post-shock gastemperature and assuming an adiabatic shock,
we calculate a relative gas velocity of ~1400 km/s. The alignment of the NAT
and WAT relative to the shock front combined with the high gas velocity from
the merger implies that the observed radio morphologies formed via ram-pressure
as a result of the merger.

stars provided they are not in stellar hydrodynamical equilibrium.
Alternatively, the shroud may be built from low mass stars or compact objects,
though then the self-lensing optical depths are overestimates of the true
optical depth by a factor of roughly 3. The distributions of timescales of the
events and their spatial variation across the face of the LMC disk offer
possibilities of identifying the dominant lens population. In propitious
circumstances, an experiment lifetime of less than 5 years is sufficient to
decide between the competing claims of Milky Way halos and LMC lenses. However,
LMC disks can sometimes mimic the microlensing properties of Galactic halos for
many years and then decades of survey work are needed. In this case
observations of parallax or binary caustic events offer the best hope for
current experiments to deduce the lens population. The difficult models to
distinguish are Milky Way halos in which the lens fraction is low (< 10 %) and
fattened LMC disks composed of lenses with a typical mass of low luminosity
stars or greater. A next-generation wide-area microlensing survey, such as the
proposed ``SuperMACHO'' experiment, will be able to distinguish even these

Exploring in detail the nature of the three dimensional galaxy distribution

the topology and morphology of the local overdensities; but it also allows us
to investigate on the z=0 cosmology, greatly increasing our quantitative
understanding of physical parameters that constrain the evolution of structures

  Conference Series, J.H. Kastner, N. Soker, & S. Rappaport, eds",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Any model for the formation of elliptical planetary nebulae (PNs) should
account for the positive correlation between the mass loss rate and the degree
of departure from sphericity of the AGB progenitor's wind. I propose that this
correlation results from dust formation above magnetic cool spots. The model
deals with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is
that a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that magnetic
cool spots are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust
formation above these cool spots leads to a higher mass loss rate in the
equatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust
formation above cool spots becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is
high. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage
that it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation
velocities of less than $10^{-4}$ times the break-up velocity. Such velocities
can be achieved by a planet companion of mass $\sim 0.1 M_{\rm Jupiter}$ which
spins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main
sequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of magnetic cool
spots also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the
descendant PN. The model cannot explain the presence of jets and ansae in
elliptical PNs. These are attributed to the destruction of a planet or brown
dwarf on the AGB core.

incoherent (diffuse) transmission limit. The resistivity shows 'semiconducting'
behavior, i.e. it increases for low temperatures above the constant behavior
for $E_g=0$. We find that the pseudogap structure in the in-plane optical
conductivity is about twice as big as in the interplane conductivity
$\sigma_c(\omega)$, in qualitative agreement with experiment. This is a
consequence of the fact that the spinfluctuation exchange interaction is
suppressed at low frequencies as a result of the opening of the pseudogap.

incoherent transmission, in the overdoped regime coherent conductance gives a
better description.

short-ranged attraction. While such a model yields a qualitative understanding
of the generic phase diagrams of both colloids and proteins, it fails to
capture one important difference: the model predicts fluid-fluid phase
separation in the metastable regime below the freezing curve. Such demixing has
been observed for globular proteins, but for colloids it appears to be
pre-empted by the appearance of a gel. In this paper, we study the effect of
additional long-range attractions on the phase behavior of spheres with
short-ranged attraction. We find that such attractions can shift the

metastable critical point may be important for crystal nucleation, our results
suggest that long-ranged attractive forces may play an important role in the
crystallization of globular proteins. However, in colloids, where refractive

gelation is likely to inhibit phase separation.

a diagrammatic perturbative expansion improved by a resummation via the

motion of the distribution function in perturbation theory. The solution of
this equation of motion reveals secular terms that grow in time, the dynamical
renormalization group resums these secular terms in real time and leads
directly to the quantum kinetic equation. We used this method to study the
relaxation in a cool gas of pions and sigma mesons in the O(4) chiral linear
sigma model. We obtain in relaxation time approximation the pion and sigma
meson relaxation rates. We also find that in large momentum limit emission and
absorption of massless pions result in threshold infrared divergence in sigma
meson relaxation rate and lead to a crossover behavior in relaxation. We then
study the relaxation of charged quasiparticles in scalar electrodynamics
(SQED). While longitudinal, Debye screened photons lead to purely exponential
relaxation, transverse photons, only dynamically screened by Landau damping
lead to anomalous relaxation, thus leading to a crossover between two different
relaxational regimes. We emphasize that infrared divergent damping rates are
indicative of non-exponential relaxation and the dynamical renormalization
group reveals the correct relaxation directly in real time. Finally we also
show that this method provides a natural framework to interpret and resolve the
issue of pinch singularities out of equilibrium and establish a direct
correspondence between pinch singularities and secular terms. We argue that
this method is particularly well suited to study quantum kinetics and transport

impact. In these notes we provide a summary of the relevant aspects of the
dynamics of symmetry breaking in many different fields with emphasis on the
experimental realizations. In condensed matter we address the dynamics of phase
ordering, the emergence of condensates, coarsening and dynamical scaling. In
QCD the possibility of disoriented chiral condensates of pions emerging during
a strongly out of equilibrium phase transition is discussed. We elaborate on
the dynamics of phase ordering in phase transitions in the Early Universe, in
particular the emergence of condensates and scaling in FRW cosmologies. We
mention some experimental efforts in different fields that study this wide
ranging phenomena and offer a quantitative theoretical description both at the
phenomenological level in condensed matter, introducing the scaling hypothesis
as well as at a microscopic level in quantum field theories. The emergence of

quantum field theory this length scale is constrained by causality. The large N
limit provides a natural bridge to compare the solutions in different settings

dimensions of variable scale, and an associated scalar field, the radion, which
is distinct from the field responsible for inflation, the inflaton. Based on a
particular ansatz for the effective potential for the inflaton and radion
(which may emerge in string theory), we show that the early expansion of the
Universe may proceed in three stages. First, the radion becomes trapped at a
value much smaller than the size of the extra dimensions today. Second, the
Universe expands exponentially, but with a Planck mass smaller than its present
value. Because the Planck mass during inflation is small, density fluctuations
in agreement with observations can arise naturally. Third, when inflation ends,
the Universe reheats, and the radion becomes free to expand once more. During
the third phase the Universe is ``radiation-dominated'' and tends toward a
fixed-point evolutionary model in which the radion grows but the temperature
remains unchanged. Ultimately, the radion becomes trapped once again at its
present value, and a short period of exponential expansion, which we identify
with the electroweak phase transition, ensues. Once this epoch is over, the
Universe reheats to a temperature of order the electroweak scale, and the
mature Universe evolves as in standard cosmological models. We show that the
present day energy density in radions can be smaller than the closure density
if the second inflationary epoch lasts about 8 e-foldings or more; the
present-day radion mass turns out to be small (less than or of the order of an
eV, depending on parameters). We argue that although our model envisages
considerable time evolution in the Planck mass, substantial spatial
fluctuations in Newton's constant are not produced.

finite temperature is non-perturbative. The effective theory for the soft
fields can be obtained by first integrating out the momentum scale T, which
yields the well known hard thermal loop effective theory. Then the latter is
used to integrate out the scale gT. One obtains a Boltzmann equation, which can
be solved in a leading logarithmic approximation. The resulting effective
theory for the soft fields is described by a Langevin equation, and it is well
suited for non-perturbative lattice simulations.

present examples of ``generalized'' gauge-mediated models with messengers in
standard model representations that give nearly identical predictions for the

similarities between an anomaly-mediated model with a small additional
universal mass added to all scalars and the gauge-mediated models with a
long-lived Wino next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle (NLSP), leading to
only a small set of observables that provide robust distinguishing criteria.
These include ratios of the heaviest to lightest selectrons, smuons, and stops.
The sign of the gluino soft mass an unambiguous distinction, but requires
measuring a difficult class of one-loop radiative corrections to sparticle

probably the most promising interaction from which this sign might be
extracted.

moving disturbance at a fluid free surface. In the case of capillary-gravity
waves it undergoes a transition from zero to a finite value as the speed of the
disturbance is increased. For the first time an experiment is designed in order
to obtain the wave resistance as a function of speed. The effect of viscosity
is explored, and a magnetic fluid is used to extend the available range of
critical speeds. The threshold values are in good agreement with the proposed
theory. Contrary to the theoretical model, however, the measured wave
resistance reveals a non monotonic speed dependence after the threshold.

studied in the context of separability of bipartite continuous variable states.
The partial transpose operation admits, in the continuous case, a geometric
interpretation as mirror reflection in phase space. This recognition leads to
uncertainty principles, stronger than the traditional ones, to be obeyed by all
separable states. For all bipartite Gaussian states, the Peres-Horodecki
criterion turns out to be necessary and sufficient condition for separability.

singularities of the energies as functions of a (complex) interaction
parameter. This is also valid for resonance state energies. Using this concept
it is argued that level anti-crossing (crossing) must imply crossing
(anti-crossing) of the corresponding widths of the resonance states. Further,
itis shown that an encircling of an exceptional point induces a phase change of
one wave function but not of the other. An experimental setup is discussed
where this phase behaviour which differs from the one encountered at a diabolic
point can be observed.

of an integrable Hamiltonian system on a dual to a semidirect product Lie
algebra so(n) x Symm(n). We give a Lagrangian derivation of the corresponding
equations of motion, and introduce a discrete time analog of this system. The
construction is based on the discrete time Lagrangian mechanics on Lie groups,
accompanied with the discrete time Lagrangian reduction. The resulting
multi-valued map (correspondence) on the dual to so(n) x Symm(n) is Poisson
with respect to the Lie-Poisson bracket, and is also completely integrable. We
find a Lax representation based on matrix factorisations, in the spirit of
Veselov-Moser.
