shown by the HI and CO(1-0) maps, while the correlation is poorer with the
distribution of the ionized gas seen through its Halpha emission. There is some
correlation with the UV radiation, but it appears that the contribution of UV
photons to the excitation of the carriers of the mid-IR emission is not
dominant in most of M 31. The spectro-imaging observations of Cesarsky et al.
(1998) show that the mid-IR spectra of several regions of M 31 are dominated by
a strong emission band at 11.3 mic while emission in the other classical
Infrared Bands at 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 mic is faint or absent. More precisely, we
find that the mid-IR spectral variations are not clearly related to the UV
radiation field. The present observations have important consequences on our
understanding of excitation of the interstellar mid-IR emission. In particular,
we conclude that like for M 31, excitation in the Galactic cirruses may not be
dominated by UV photons but rather by another mechanism which remains to be
identified (visible photons ?). The UV excitation appears to become important
when the UV radiation density is of the order of twice that near the Sun.

equations both in the bulk and in the boundary layers. Several regimes are
identified in the Rayleigh number versus Prandtl number phase space, defined by
whether the boundary layer or the bulk dominates the global kinetic and thermal
dissipation, respectively. The crossover between the regimes is calculated. In
the regime which has most frequently been studied in experiment (Ra smaller
than 10^{11}) the leading terms are $Nu\sim Ra^{1/4}Pr^{1/8}$, $Re \sim
Ra^{1/2} Pr^{-3/4}$ for $Pr < 1$ and $Nu\sim Ra^{1/4}Pr^{-1/12}$, $Re \sim

a slightly larger (effective) Nu vs Ra scaling exponent can arise. -- The

antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain via the spin exchange interactions.
Using a solution at a special limit, we characterize the gapless modes of the
spin gap fixed point at weak coupling $ J_{K}\ll J_{H},E_{F} $. we show that
the only gapless pairing mode with divergent susceptibility is a composite
odd-parity odd-frequency singlet pairing order parameter, while the ordinary
BCS even-parity singlet pairing mode is incoherent. For 2-leg ladder systems,
we note that it is possible to have a range of doping where the chemical
potential cuts only the anti-bonding band while the bonding band remains
half-filled. We propose that, in such a state, the 2-leg ladder is effectively
realizing the one-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg model.

been investigated in detail via ac susceptibility as well as dc magnetization
measurements. The PE region comprises two discontinuous first order like
transitions, located near its onset and peak positions and reflects a stepwise
fracturing of the flux line lattice (FLL). This scenario can be construed as an
alternative to a scheme involving the appearance of Generalized
Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (GFFLO) state as considered in the case of PE
phenomenon in isostructural Yb$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$ system. The procedure of
thermal cycling across the onset position of PE produces an open hysteresis
loop, which is consistent with the notion of the fracturing of the FLL. A study
of thermomagnetic history dependence of different metastable vortex states
shows the path dependence in the critical current density J_c(H,T) over a large
part of the (H,T) parameter space. The path dependence in J_c ceases above the
peak position of the PE, suggesting a complete amorphization and the loss of
long range correlations of the FLL at (T_p, H_p) line. A plausible vortex phase
diagram has been illustrated for Ca$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$n and phases like an
elastic solid, a plastic solid, a pinned amorphous and an unpinned amorphous
states have been identified.

gravity in five dimensions is applied to some recent suggestions for
brane-world phenomenology. The method involves only first order differential
equations. It is inspired by gauged supergravity but does not require
supersymmetry. Our first application is a full non-linear treatment of a
recently studied stabilization mechanism for inter-brane spacing. The spacing
is uniquely determined after conventional fine-tuning to achieve zero
four-dimensional cosmological constant. If the fine-tuning is imperfect, there
are solutions in which the four-dimensional branes are de Sitter or anti-de
Sitter spacetimes. Our second application is a construction of smooth domain
wall solutions which in a well-defined limit approach any desired array of
sharply localized positive-tension branes. As an offshoot of the analysis we
suggest a construction of a supergravity c-function for non-supersymmetric
four-dimensional renormalization group flows.
  The equations for fluctuations about an arbitrary scalar-gravity background
are also studied. It is shown that all models in which the fifth dimension is
effectively compactified contain a massless graviton. The graviton is the
constant mode in the fifth dimension. The separated wave equation can be recast
into the form of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The graviton wave-function
is then the supersymmetric ground state, and there are no tachyons.

manifolds corresponding to the IIB-brane superalgebra, which is characterized
by the generators of D3-, D5-, NS5- and KK5-branes in addition to the
previously introduced generators of supertranslations, F- and D-strings. The
charges of D1-, F1- and D3-branes are related to those of the M-algebra, but
some charges of D5- and NS5-branes are not. The S-duality of the type-IIB

work on the world-sheet of the string propagating near boundary, in which we
can safely make use of the Wakimoto free field representation. Secondly, we
present a more rigid formulation of space-time topological conformal algebra

started in Judah, Roslanowski and Shelah \math.LO/9310224 and Roslanowski and
Shelah math.LO/9807172, math.LO/9703222, and we investigate the method of norms
on possibilities in the context of ccc forcing notions, getting a number of
constructions of nicely definable ccc forcings. The second theme of the paper
is a part of the general program ``how special are random and Cohen forcing
notions (or: the respective ideals)''. Shelah math.LO/9303208 shows that the
two forcing notions may occupy special positions in the realm of nicely
definable forcing notions. In this realm we may classify forcing notions using
the methods of Shelah [Sh:630] (math.LO/9712283), [Sh:669] and, for example,
declare that very Souslin (or generally omega-nw-nep) ccc forcing notions are
really nice. Both the Cohen forcing notion and the random forcing notion and
their FS iterations (and nice subforcings) are all ccc omega-nw-nep, and
Problem 4.24 of math.LO/9906113 asked if we have more examples. It occurs that
our method relatively easily results in very Souslin ccc forcing notions. The
third theme is Sweet & Sour, and it is related to one of the most striking
differences between the random and the Cohen forcing notions that appears when
we consider the respective regularity properties of projective sets: the
Lebesgue measurability of Sigma^1_3 sets implies aleph_1 is inaccessible in L,
while one can construct (in ZFC) a forcing notion P which forces ``projective
subsets of R have the Baire property'' (see Shelah [Sh:176]).

variable) states. Duan et al remark that their criterion is based on a ""much
stronger bound"" on the total variance of a pair of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type
operators than is required simply by the uncertainty relation. Here, we seek to
formalize and test this particular assertion in both classical and
quantum-theoretic frameworks. We first attach to these states the classical a
priori probability (Jeffreys' prior), proportional to the volume element of the
Fisher information metric on the Riemannian manifold of Gaussian (quadrivariate
normal) probability distributions. Then, numerical evidence indicates that more
than ninety-nine percent of the Gaussian two-party states do, in fact, meet the
more stringent criterion for separability. We collaterally note that the prior
probability assigned to the classical states, that is those having positive
Glauber-Sudarshan P-representations, is less than one-thousandth of one
percent. We, then, seek to attach as a measure to the Gaussian two-party
states, the volume element of the associated (quantum-theoretic) Bures (minimal
monotone) metric. Our several extensive analyses, then, persistently yield
probabilities of separability and classicality that are, to very high orders of
accuracy, unity and zero, respectively, so the two apparently quite distinct
(classical and quantum-theoretic) forms of analysis are rather remarkably
consistent in their findings.
