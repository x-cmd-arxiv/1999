far-infrared (FIR) properties of quasars with disturbed and undisturbed host
galaxies. By using survival analysis, we show that the quasars with disturbed
host galaxies, with morphologies classified from a homogenous data set, have a
60 micron luminosity distribution that is different from that of those with
undisturbed hosts with >97% confidence. For morphological classifications using
an inhomogenous data set, including HST data for some objects, this confidence
rises to >99% confidence. The mean 60 micron luminosity of the disturbed-host
quasars is several times greater than that of the undisturbed-host quasars.
However, possible biases in the PG survey might affect these conclusions. Our
results are interpreted as supporting the idea that quasars are related to at
least some Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies. We discuss the implications of this
result for studies of quasar and galaxy evolution.

remarkable decrease of the HCN emission in the post-starburst nuclei, despite
the strong CO concentrations there. The R(HCN/CO) values in the central a few
100 pc regions of these quiescent galaxies are very low, 0.02 to 0.04. A rough
correlation between R(HCN/CO) and Ha/CO ratios, which is an indicator of star
formation efficiency, is found at a few 100 pc scale. The fraction of dense
molecular gas in the total molecular gas, measured from R(HCN/CO), may be an
important parameter that controls star formation. In some Seyfert galaxies we
find extremely high R(HCN/CO) exceeding 0.3. These very high ratios are never

have provided the first dynamical measures of the masses of pre-main-sequence
(PMS) stars, providing support for the calibrations of PMS evolutionary tracks.
Surprisingly, in some star-forming regions PMS binary frequencies are higher
than among main-sequence solar-type stars. The difference in PMS and
main-sequence binary frequencies is apparently not an evolutionary effect;
recent attention has focussed on correlations between binary frequency and
stellar density or cloud temperatures. Accretion disks are common among young
binary stars. Binaries with separations between 1 AU and 100 AU have
substantially less submillimeter emission than closer or wider binaries,
suggesting that they have truncated their disks. Evidence of dynamical clearing
has been seen in several binaries. Remarkably, PMS binaries of all separations
show evidence of circumstellar disks and continued accretion. This suggests
that the circumstellar disks are replenished from circumbinary disks or
envelopes. The frequent presence of disks suggests that planet formation can
occur in binary environments, and formation of planets in wide binaries is
already established by their discovery. Circumbinary disk masses around very
short period binaries are ample to form planetary systems such as our own. The
nature of planetary systems among the most common binaries, with separations
between 10 AU and 100 AU, is less clear given the observed reduction in disk
mass, though they may have disk masses adequate for the formation of
terrestrial-like planets.

134 ONC members. Of these, 67 were detected at multiple epochs with identical

understood as an effect of deuterium burning, which temporarily slows the
contraction and thus spin-up of stars with M <0.25 solar masses and ages of ~1
My. Stars with M <0.25 solar masses have not had time to bridge the gap in the
period distribution at ~4 days. Excess H-K and I-K emission, as well as CaII
infrared triplet equivalent widths (Hillenbrand et al. 1998), show weak but
significant correlations with rotation period among stars with M >0.25 solar

hence contains vital information about the history of galactic evolution. One
of the main problems associated with estimating an isotropic CIRB in the near
infrared (1-5 microns) is the unknown contribution from stars within our own
galaxy. The optimal observational window to search for a background in the
near-IR is at 3.5 microns since that is the wavelength region where the other
main foreground, the zodiacal dust emission, is the least. It is not possible
to map out the entire 3.5 micron sky at a resolution which will accurately
estimate the flux from stars. However, since the CIRB is presumably isotropic,
it can potentially be detected by selecting a smaller field and imaging it at
good resolution to estimate the stellar intensity. We selected a 2x2 degree
""dark spot"" near the North Galactic Pole which had the least intensity at 3.5
microns after a zodiacal light model was subtracted from the all-sky maps
generated by the Diffuse InfraRed Background Experiment (DIRBE). The measured
total intensity of the few bright stars in this field was combined with a model
for the contribution from dimmer stars and subtracted from the zodi-subtracted
DIRBE map. The contribution from the interstellar medium was also subtracted
leaving a residual intensity at 2.2 microns of: 16.4+/-4.4 kJy/sr or 22.4+/-6

diffusion models. In this paper, we reexamine the earlier ambipolar diffusion
models, and conclude that the L1544 core can be understood to be a magnetically
supercritical core undergoing magnetically diluted collapse. We also present a
new model specifically designed to simulate the formation and evolution of the
L1544 core. This model, which uses reasonable input parameters, yields mass and
radial density distributions, as well as neutral and ion infall speed profiles,
that are in very good agreement with physical values deduced by observations.
The lifetime of the core is also in good agreement with prestellar core
lifetimes estimated from statistics of an ensemble of cores. The observational
input can act to constrain other currently unobserved quantities such as the
degree of ionization, and the background magnetic field strength and
orientation near the L1544 core.

curvilinear boundary, one may obtain asymptotic estimates of energy shifts,
which is especially useful in lattice QCD studies of nonrelativistic bound
states. Energy shift expressions are found for periodic (antiperiodic) boundary
conditions on antipodal points, which require Neumann (Dirichlet) boundary
conditions for even parity states and Dirichlet (Neumann) boundary conditions
for odd parity states. It is found that averaging over periodic and
antiperiodic boundary conditions is an effective way of removing the asymptotic
energy shifts from the boundary. Asymptotic energy shifts from boxes with self
coupled walls are also considered and shown to be effectively antipodal. The
energy shift equations are illustrated by the solution of the bounded harmonic
oscillator and hydrogen atoms.

carries are absorbed into the formed Q-balls, whose sizes and the charges

beta-function as a typical quantity we estimate that the one-loop approximation
is valid with accuracy of deviations not more than 30% in the region of the
parameters: $0.2 \stackrel{<}{\sim}{\large \alpha, \tilde{\alpha}}
\stackrel{<}{\sim}1.35.$ The phase diagram given in the present paper
corresponds to the above-mentioned region of $\alpha, \tilde \alpha$. Under the
point of view that the Higgs particle is a monopole with a magnetic charge g,
the obtained electric fine structure constant turns out to be
$\alpha_{crit}\approx{0.18_5}$ by the Dirac relation. This value is very close
to the $\alpha_{crit}^{lat}\approx{0.20}$ which in a U(1) lattice gauge theory
corresponds to the phase transition between the ""Coulomb"" and confinement
phases. Such a result is very encouraging for the idea of an approximate
""universality"" (regularization independence) of gauge couplings at the phase
transition point. This idea was suggested by the authors in their earlier
papers.
