900- 1800 A. Our ~3 A resolution spectra were obtained with the Hopkins
Ultraviolet Telescope during the Astro-1 mission in December 1990 and during
the Astro-2 mission in March 1995. Both spectra exhibit a change in slope near
the Lyman limit in the quasar rest frame. At longer UV wavelengths, the
continuum has a power-law index of 0.5-0.7, while shortward of the Lyman limit
it is 1.2-1.7. The energy distribution in nuf_nu therefore peaks close to the
quasar Lyman limit. The short wavelength UV power law extrapolates well to
match the soft X-ray excess seen in simultaneous observations with BBXRT and
nearly simultaneous ROSAT observations. The general shape of the broad-band
spectrum of 3C 273 is consistent with that of an optically thick accretion disk
whose emergent spectrum has been Comptonized by a hot medium. Our UV spectrum
is well described by a Schwarzschild black hole of 7e8 Msun accreting matter at
a rate of 13 Msun/yr through a disk inclined at 60 degrees. Superposed on the
intrinsic disk spectrum is an empirically determined Lyman edge of optical
depth 0.5. The Comptonizing medium has a Compton parameter y~1, an optical
depth to electron scattering of unity, and a temperature of 4e8 K. This overall
shape is the same as that found by Zheng et al. and Laor et al. in their UV and
X-ray composite spectra for quasars, giving physical validity to the composite
spectrum approach. When combined with those results, we find that the generic
ionizing continuum shape for quasars is a power law of energy index 1.7-2.2,
extending from the Lyman limit to ~1 keV. The observational gap in the extreme
ultraviolet for these combined data describing the quasar continuum shape is
now only half a decade in frequency.

  Acceleration in the Klein-Nishina Regime","LateX, 20 pages, 5 figures, revised version accepted for publication
  in the ApJ",,"10.1086/308738",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider the radiative acceleration to relativistic bulk velocities of a
cold, optically thin plasma which is exposed to an external source of
gamma-rays. The flow is driven by radiative momentum input to the gas, the
accelerating force being due to Compton scattering in the relativistic
Klein-Nishina limit. The bulk Lorentz factor of the plasma, Gamma, derived as a
function of distance from the radiating source, is compared with the
corresponding result in the Thomson limit. Depending on the geometry and
spectrum of the radiation field, we find that particles are accelerated to the
asymptotic Lorentz factor at infinity much more rapidly in the relativistic
regime; and the radiation drag is reduced as blueshifted, aberrated photons
experience a decreased relativistic cross section and scatter preferentially in
the forward direction. The random energy imparted to the plasma by gamma-rays
can be converted into bulk motion if the hot particles execute many Larmor
orbits before cooling. This `Compton afterburn' may be a supplementary source
of momentum if energetic leptons are injected by pair creation, but can be
neglected in the case of pure Klein-Nishina scattering. Compton drag by
side-scattered radiation is shown to be more important in limiting the bulk
Lorentz factor than the finite inertia of the accelerating medium. The
processes discussed here may be relevant to a variety of astrophysical
situations where luminous compact sources of hard X- and gamma-ray photons are
observed, including active galactic nuclei, galactic black hole candidates, and
gamma-ray bursts.

are also observed toward the two stars. But whereas the deuterium Lyman alpha
line is well detected in the LIC with an abundance in agreement with that
obtained by Linsky et al. (1993 & 1995), no significant DI line is detected in

  However, the Lyman alpha lines toward Sirius A and Sirius B are not trivial.
An excess of absorption is seen in the blue wing of the Sirius A Lyman alpha

an excess in absorption is seen in the red wing and interpreted as the core of

model ($\tau_{SF}$=0.1 Gyr and $t_{gw}$=0.353 Gyr), which is known to reproduce
the photometric properties of early-type galaxies in clusters, is inconsistent
with redshift distributions of early-type galaxies in the field environment due
to overpredictions of galaxies at $z\gsim1.4$ even with strong extinction which
is at work until $t_{gw}$. In order for dust extinction to be more effective,
we change $\tau_{SF}$ and $t_{gw}$ as free parameters, and find that models
with $\tau_{SF}\gsim0.5$ Gyr and $t_{gw}>1.0$ Gyr can be made consistent with
both the observed redshift distributions and number counts, if we introduce

the intracluster medium (ICM) can potentially yield significant information
about the structure and dynamical history of clusters. To develop our
understanding of this phenomenon we present results from numerical modelling of
the galaxy/ICM interaction, as the galaxy moves through the cluster. The
simulations have been performed for a broad range, of ICM temperatures (kT =
1,4 and 8 keV), representative of poor clusters or groups through to rich
clusters. There are several dynamical features that can be identified in these
simulations; for supersonic galaxy motion, a leading bow-shock is present, and
also a weak gravitationally focussed wake or tail behind the galaxy (analogous
to Bondi-Hoyle accretion). For galaxies with higher mass-replenishment rates
and a denser interstellar medium (ISM), the dominant feature is a dense
ram-pressure stripped tail. In line with other simulations, we find that the
ICM/galaxy ISM interaction can result in complex time- dependent dynamics, with
ram-pressure stripping occurring in an episodic manner. In order to facilitate
this comparison between the observational consequences of dynamical studies and
X-ray observations we have calculated synthetic X-ray flux and hardness maps
from these simulations. These calculations predict that the ram-pressure
stripped tail will usually be the most visible feature, though in nearby
galaxies the bow-shock preceding the galaxy should also be apparent in deeper
X-ray observations. We briefly discuss these results and compare with X-ray
observations of galaxies where there is evidence of such interactions.

data on the intensities and temperature dependence of the shift, width, and
spin-lattice relaxation rate of these resonances, we conclude that the spinless
Zn 3$d$$^{10}$ state induces local moments on the near-neighbour ($% nn$) Cu
atoms. Additionally, we conjecture that the local moments actually extend to
the farther Cu atoms with the magnetization alternating in sign at subsequent
$nn$ sites. We show that this analysis is compatible with ESR data taken on
dilute Gd doped (on the Y site) and on neutron scattering data reported
recently on Zn substituted YBCO$_{6 + x}$. For optimally doped compounds
$^{89}$Y $nn$ resonances are not detected, but a large $T$% -dependent
contribution to the $^{89}$Y NMR linewidth is evidenced and is also attributed
to the occurence of a weak induced local moment near the Zn. These results are
compatible with macroscopic magnetic measurements performed on YBCO$_{6 + x}$
samples prepared specifically in order to minimize the content of impurity
phases. We find significant differences between the present results on the
underdoped YBCO$_{6 + x}$ samples and $% ^{27}$Al NMR data taken on Al$^{3+}$

close to this lower bound, the second set of excitations will be too heavy to

wavefunctions, one can compute not only the quark and gluon distributions
measured in deep inelastic lepton-proton scattering, but also the multi-parton
correlations which control the distribution of particles in the proton
fragmentation region and dynamical higher twist effects. Light-cone
wavefunctions also provide a systematic framework for evaluating exclusive
hadronic matrix elements, including timelike heavy hadron decay amplitudes and
form factors. The $\alpha_V$ coupling, defined from the QCD heavy quark
potential, provides a physical expansion parameter for perturbative QCD with an
analytic dependence on the fermion masses which is now known to two-loop order.
Conformal symmetry provides a template for QCD predictions, including relations
between observables which are present even in a theory which is not scale
invariant. Commensurate scale relations are perturbative QCD predictions based

excellent opportunity to constrain extended gauge model parameters. To this
end, it is often assumed, that in order to obtain more reliable estimates, one
should include the sizable one--loop Standard Model (SM) corrections, which
modify the $Z^0$ couplings as well as other observables. This conviction is
based on the belief that the higher order contributions from the ``extension
sector'' will be numerically small. However, the structure of higher order
corrections can be quite different when comparing the SM with its extension,
thus one should avoid assumptions which do not care about such facts. This is
the case for all models with $\rho_{\rm tree} \equiv
M_W^2/(M_{Z}^2\cos^2{\Theta_W}) \neq 1$. As an example, both the manifest
left-right symmetric model and the $SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y \otimes
\tilde{U}(1)$ model, with an additional $Z'$ boson, are discussed and special
attention to the top contribution to $\Delta \rho$ is given. We conclude that
the only sensible way to confront a model with the experimental data is to
renormalize it self-consistently, if not, parameters which depend strongly on
quantum effects should be left free in fits, though essential physics is lost
in this way. We should note that arguments given here allow us to state that at
the level of loop corrections (indirect effects) there is nothing like a

injective resolutions for an arbitrary Grothendieck category, as has apparently
also been done by Morel. In particular, this works for sheaves on a ringed
space, and for quasi-coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact, quasi-separated
scheme. However, this injective model structure is not well suited to studying
the derived tensor product, so we investigate other model structures. The most
successful of these is the flat model structure on complexes of sheaves over a
ringed space. This is based on flat resolutions, and is compatible with the
tensor product. As a corollary, we get model categories of differential graded
algebras of sheaves and differential graded modules over a given differential
graded algebra of sheaves.

the braided line is commutative as an algebra, all results can be viewed both
as results in classical q-analysis and in braided algebra. We define various
classes of functions on which the convolution is well-defined and we show that
they are algebras under the defined product. One particularly nice family of
algebras, a decreasing chain depending on a parameter running through (0,1],
turns out to have 1/2 as the critical parameter value above which the algebras
are commutative. Morerover, the commutative algebras in this family are
precisely the algebras in which each function is determined by its q-moments.
We also treat the relationship between q-convolution and q-Fourier transform.
Finally, in the Appendix, we show an equivalence between the existence of an
analytic continuation of a function defined on a q-lattice, and the behaviour

general parallel operations. A broad range of physical systems and interactions
are suitable: we highlight two potential implementations.

formation and assistance, are shown to be special cases of the relative entropy
of entanglement. The difference between these measures for an ensemble of mixed
states is shown to depend on the availability of classical information about
particular members of the ensemble. Based on this, relations between relative
entropy of entanglement and mutual information are derived.

unique characteristics of these quantum functions by recent techniques
developed for the analysis of quantum computations. We also discuss relativized
quantum functions that make adaptive and nonadaptive oracle queries.

measurement of light field intensity to a precise measurement of photon number
is described using a generalized measurement postulate. In the intermediate
regime, quantization appears as a weak modulation of measurement probability.
In this regime, the measurement result is strongly correlated with the amount
of phase decoherence introduced by the measurement interaction. In particular,
the accidental observation of half integer photon numbers preserves phase
coherence in the light field, while the accidental observation of quantized
values increases decoherence. The quantum mechanical nature of this correlation
is discussed and the implications for the general interpretation of
quantization are considered.
