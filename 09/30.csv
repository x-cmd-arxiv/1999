  continuum images","Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/308401",,"astro-ph",,"  High dynamic range imaging of submillimeter dust emission from the envelopes
of eight young protostars in the Taurus and Perseus star-forming regions has
been carried out using the SCUBA submillimeter camera on the James Clerk
Maxwell Telescope. Good correspondence between the spectral classifications of
the protostars and the spatial distributions of their dust emission is
observed, in the sense that those with cooler spectral energy distributions
also have a larger fraction of the submillimeter flux originating in an
extended envelope compared with a disk. This results from the cool sources
having more massive envelopes rather than warm sources having larger disks.
Azimuthally-averaged radial profiles of the dust emission are used to derive
the power-law index of the envelope density distributions, p (defined by rho
proportional to r^-p), and most of the sources are found to have values of p
consistent with those predicted by models of cloud collapse. However, the
youngest protostars in our sample, L1527 and HH211-mm, deviate significantly
from the theoretical predictions, exhibiting values of p somewhat lower than
can be accounted for by existing models. For L1527 heating of the envelope by
shocks where the outflow impinges on the surrounding medium may explain our
result. For HH211-mm another explanation is needed, and one possibility is that
a shallow density profile is being maintained in the outer envelope by magnetic
fields and/or turbulence. If this is the case star formation must be determined
by the rate at which the support is lost from the cloud, rather than the
hydrodynamical properties of the envelope, such as the sound speed.

dispersion longslit spectroscopy, together with archival HST WFPC2 V and
NICMOS2 J and H images. We find that there is evidence of two modes of star
formation, in bursts and continuously. The equivalent width of the CaII triplet
absorption lines show that, in the metal rich central region, the continuum is
dominated by a population of red supergiants. The gaseous and stellar
kinematics along three slit position angles, suggest the existence of a
hierarchy of disks within disks, whose dynamics are decoupled at the two ILRs,
that we find at 180 pc and at 1100 pc. This is supported by the structure seen
in the high resolution HST images. The nucleus is spatially resolved within a
radius of 1.5 arcsec, just inside the innermost ILR. Outside the iILR, the
stellar CaT velocity profile is resolved into two components, associated with
the bar and the disk. Several results indicate that this is a dynamically old
system. It is thus possible that a nuclear bar has existed in NGC 6951 that
drove the gas towards the nucleus, as in the bars within bars scenario, but
that this bar has already dissolved by the gas accumulated within the
circumnuclear region. We discuss the possibility that the kinematical component
inside the iILR could be due to a nuclear outflow produced by the combined
effects of SN and SN remnants, or to a nuclear disk, as in the disk within disk
scenario that we propose for the fueling of the AGN in NGC 6951.

emission from high-J (J=14-25) CO, para- and ortho-H2O and OH transitions over

emission can be explained by a single emission region at T~300-900 K and
n(H_2)~10^(5-6) cm^(-3),with a diameter of about 2-3 arcsec. This corresponds
to a very compact region of 300-400 AU at the distance of 140 pc. An higher
temperature component seems to be needed to explain the highest excitation CO
and water lines. We derive a water abundance of 1-7x10^(-5) and an OH abundance
of ~3x10^(-5) with respect to molecular hydrogen, implying water and OH
enhancements by more than a factor of 10 with respect to the expected ambient
gas abundance. The observed cooling in the various species amounts to 0.04
L(sun),comparable to the mechanical luminosity of the outflow, indicating that
the stellar winds could be responsible of the line excitation through shocks.
In order to explain the observed molecular cooling in T Tau in terms of C-type
shock models, we hypothesise that the strong far-ultraviolet radiation field
photodissociates water in favour of OH. This would explain the large
overabundance of OH observed. The estimated relatively high density and
compactness of the observed emission suggest that it originates from the shocks
taking place at the base of the molecular outflow emission, in the region where
the action of the stellar winds from the two stars of the binary system is
important.

as a light-like limit is investigated. This amounts to studying quantum field
theory compactified on a space-like circle of vanishing radius in an
appropriate kinematical setting. While this limit is unproblematic at the
tree-level, it is non-trivial for loop amplitudes. In one-loop amplitudes, when
the propagators are written using standard Feynman $\alpha$-parameters we show
that, generically, in the limit of vanishing radius, one of the
$\alpha$-integrals is replaced by a discrete sum and the (UV renormalized)
one-loop amplitude has a finite light-like limit. This is analogous to what
happens in string theory. There are however exceptions and the limit may
diverge in certain theories or at higher loop order. We give a rather detailed
analysis of the problems one might encounter. We show that quantum
electrodynamics at one loop has a well-defined light-like limit.

becomes finite dimensional. As a result, we get a massive FT in space-time with

  0/1-polytopes have a very simple definition and explicit descriptions; we can
enumerate and analyze small examples explicitly in the computer (e.g. using
{\tt polymake}). However, any intuition that is derived from the analysis of
examples in ``low dimensions'' will miss the true complexity of 0/1-polytopes.
Thus, in the following we will study several aspects of the complexity of
higher-dimensional 0/1-polytopes: the doubly-exponential number of
combinatorial types, the number of facets which can be huge, and the
coefficients of defining inequalities which sometimes turn out to be extremely
large. Some of the effects and results will be backed by proofs in the course
of these lectures; we will also be able to verify some of them on explicit

Soc., 84 (2002), 213-230",,,"math.SP math.DG math.SG",,"  A theorem of J. Hersch (1970) states that for any smooth metric on $S^2$,
with total area equal to $4\pi$, the first nonzero eigenvalue of the Laplace
operator acting on functions is less than or equal to 2 (this being the value
for the standard round metric). For metrics invariant under the standard
$S^1$-action on $S^2$, one can restrict the Laplace operator to the subspace of
$S^1$-invariant functions and consider its spectrum there. The corresponding
eigenvalues will be called invariant eigenvalues, and the purpose of this paper
is to analyse its possible values.
  We first show that there is no general analogue of Hersch's theorem, by
exhibiting explicit families of $S^1$-invariant metrics with total area $4\pi$
where the first invariant eigenvalue ranges through any value between 0 and
$\infty$. We then restrict ourselves to $S^1$-invariant metrics that can be
embedded in ${\bf R}^3$ as surfaces of revolution. For this subclass we are
able to provide optimal upper bounds for all invariant eigenvalues. As a
consequence, we obtain an analogue of Hersch's theorem with an optimal upper
bound (greater than 2 and geometrically interesting). This subclass of metrics
on $S^2$ includes all $S^1$-invariant metrics with non-negative Gauss
curvature.
  One of the key ideas in the proofs of these results comes from symplectic
geometry, and amounts to the use of the moment map of the $S^1$-action as a
coordinate function on $S^2$.

variables leading to different off-shell behavior in the nucleon-nucleon
amplitude as well as the photon-nucleon vertex. As a result we obtain a class
of equivalent Lagrangians, generating identical S-matrix elements, of which the
original Lagrangian is but one representative. We make use of this property in
order to show that what appears as an off-shell effect in an S-matrix element
for one Lagrangian may originate in a contact term from an equivalent
Lagrangian. By explicit calculation we demonstrate for the case of
nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung as well as nucleon Compton scattering the
equivalence of observables from which we conclude that off-shell effects cannot
in any unambiguous way be extracted from an S-matrix element. Finally, we also
discuss some implications of introducing off-shell effects on a
phenomenological basis, resulting from the requirement that the description of
one process be consistent with that of other processes described by the same
Lagrangian.

extraction was found to increase significantly the efficiency of the process.
The beam extraction efficiency was about 25%. Studies of time dependent effects
found that the turn-to-turn structure was governed mainly by accelerator beam
dynamics. An investigation of a pre-scatterer using the accelerator flying wire
system showed that a fiber could produce a significant extracted flux,
consistent with expectations. Based on these results, it is feasible to
construct a parasitic 5-10 MHz proton beam from the Tevatron collider.

Dewar","Anderson-Localized Ballooning Modes in General Toroidal Plasmas","5 pages (REVTeX), 6 figures (.ps)","Phys Plasmas 7, 2302-2305 (2000)","10.1063/1.874064",,"physics.plasm-ph",,"  Ballooning instabilities are investigated in three-dimensional magnetic
toroidal plasma confinement systems with low global magnetic shear. The lack of
any continuous symmetry in the plasma equilibrium can lead to these modes being
localized along the field lines by a process similar to Anderson localization.
This produces a multibranched local eigenvalue dependence, where each branch
corresponds to a different unit cell of the extended covering space in which
the eigenfunction peak resides. These phenomena are illustrated numerically for
the three-field-period heliac H-1, and contrasted with an axisymmetric
$s$-$\alpha$ tokamak model. The localization allows a perturbative expansion
about zero shear, enabling the effects of shear to be investigated.

single-particle states, total teleportation of coherent states and encoded
single-particle states, and intramolecular teleportation of nuclear spin
states. We find a set of commuting observables whose measurement directly
projects onto the Bell-basis and discuss a possible experiment, based on
two-photon absorption, allowing, for the first time, total teleportation of the
state of a single external photon through a direct projective measurement.

quadrupole interacting with a precessing magnetic (electric) field.
