the local Compton temperature ($\sim 10^7 - 10^8$ K); at larger depths, the gas
temperature drops abruptly to form a thin layer with $T\sim 10^6$ K, while at

find that most of the Fe K$\alpha$ line emission and absorption edge are
produced in the coolest, deepest layers, while the Fe atoms in the hottest,

contribution to reprocessing features in $\sim 6.4-10$ keV energy range. We
provide a summary of how X-ray reprocessing features depend on parameters of

was recently discovered to have a spectacular, nearly edge-on, circumstellar
disk prominent at ~20 microns (Jayawardhana et al. 1998; Koerner et al. 1998).
These new images, obtained with OSCIR at Keck II, show that the disk's size at
10 microns is comparable to its size at 18 microns. Therefore, the 18
micron-emitting dust may also emit some, or all, of the 10 micron radiation.
Using these multi-wavelength images, we determine a ""characteristic"" diameter
of 2-3 microns for the mid-infrared-emitting dust particles if they are
spherical and composed of astronomical silicates. Particles this small are
expected to be blown out of the system by radiation pressure in a few hundred
years, and therefore these particles are unlikely to be primordial. Dynamical
modeling of the disk (Wyatt et al. 2000) indicates that the disk surface
density is relatively sharply peaked near 70 AU, which agrees with the mean
annular radius deduced by Schneider et al. (1999) from their NICMOS images. We
present evidence (~1.8 sigma significance) for a brightness asymmetry that may
result from the presence of the hole and the gravitational perturbation of the
disk particle orbits by the low-mass stellar companion or a planet. This
""pericenter glow,"" which must still be confirmed, results from a very small (a
few AU) shift of the disk's center of symmetry relative to the central star HR
4796A; one side of the inner boundary of the annulus is shifted towards HR
4796A, thereby becoming warmer and more infrared-emitting. The possible
detection of pericenter glow implies that the detection of even complex
dynamical effects of planets on disks is within reach.

clusters, groups and galaxies, consistently with the hierarchical picture of
gravitational clustering and their evolution in time. Using a simple model for
the X-ray luminosity (taking into account entropy considerations), we obtain
the X-ray luminosity distribution of groups and clusters. Then, using the same
formalism we derive the galaxy and quasar multiplicity functions. In
particular, we show that the use of the standard Press-Schechter prescription
leads to erroneous conclusions at low redshifts while our approach provides a
reasonable agreement with observations in a natural fashion because it is able
to distinguish galactic halos from groups or clusters. Thus, we obtain a global
and consistent picture of the X-ray emissions from all structures. In
particular, we show that future observations (e.g., from AXAF) could provide
interesting information on galaxy evolution. Indeed, they will constrain the
importance of a possible hot diffuse gaseous phase in galactic halos and they
could reveal massive galaxies which are just being formed, through the X-ray
emission of their cooling gas.

argues against a dynamical origin for them. A wide gap in the color

several other clusters. This suggests a common mechanism, probably related to
giant branch mass loss. The diagram contains a significant population of hot
sub-HB stars, which we interpret as the ``blue-hook'' objects predicted by
D'Cruz et al. (1996a). These are produced by late He-flashes in stars which
have undergone unusually large giant branch mass loss. omega Cen has a

pronounced central hole in the CO distribution as claimed by others. The
molecular ring is just outside the radius of peak emission from warm dust, but
coincides with the peak of colder dust emission. Various 12CO and 13CO
transitions have been observed from three positions including the center, which
was also observed in the 492 GHz transition. The line measurements have been
modelled by emission from a clumpy mixture of low-density molecular gas at
about T(kin) = 10 K and high-density molecular gas at temperatures of 10 K and
20 K. The CO to H2 conversion factor in NGC 7331 is lower than that in the
Milky Way, and lowest in the center of NGC 7331. The total interstellar gas
mass is dominated by molecular hydrogen in the bulge and in the ring, and by
atomic hydrogen outside the ring. Total hydrogen mass densities in the ring are
about twice those in the bulge. Total gas to dynamic mass ratios increase from
1% in the bulge to 3% outside the ring. The bulge molecular gas may have
originated in mass loss from bulge stars, in which case the molecular ring is
probably the consequence of evacuation efficiency decreases at the outer bulge
edge.

collaboration during their first year of observation towards Baade's Window we
estimate the mass functions for the bulge and disk populations following the
mass moment method. We find that the mass function can be described by a
decreasing power-law with slope $\alpha \simeq 2.0$ in both cases and a minimal
mass of $\sim 0.01$ $M_{\odot}$ for the bulge and $\sim 0.02$ $M_{\odot}$ for
the disk, respectively. Assuming that the obtained mass function for the disk
is also valid in the spiral arms, we find that the expected number of events
towards the spiral arms is in reasonable agreement with the observations.
However, the small number of observed events does not yet constrain much the
different parameters entering in the computation of the mass function. To study
the influence of the Magellanic Clouds on the shape and the velocity dispersion
in the halo we perform a N-body simulation. We find that their presence induces
a slight flattening of the halo ($q_{H}\simeq 0.8$). As a result the expected
number of microlensing events towards some targets in the halo, such as the LMC
or the SMC, decreases by about 20%, whereas due to the the modification induced
on the velocity dispersion the event duration increases.

shown that the delay between the end of inflaton decay and thermalization
allows the thermal gravitino upper bound on the reheating temperature to be
raised from 10^{8} GeV to as much as 10^{12} GeV in realistic inflation models.
Requiring that thermalization occurs before nucleosynthesis imposes an upper
bound on the inflaton mass as a function of the reheating temperature, m_{S} <
10^{10} (T_{R}/1 GeV)^{7/9} GeV. It is also shown that even in realistic

It is generated by fundamental unipotents, which are constructed by
exponentiating the Chevalley generators of the corresponding Lie algebra. We
then extend a method suggested by the above authors and used by Sen for the
heterotic string to get the discrete U-duality group in d=3, thereby obtaining
a quantized symmetry in d=3 from a d=4 quantization condition. This is studied
first in a toy model, corresponding to d=5 simple supergravity, and then
applied to M-theory. It turns out that, in the toy model, the resulting
U-duality group in d=3 is strictly smaller than the one generated by the
fundamental unipotents corresponding to all Chevalley generators. However, for
M-theory, both groups agree. We illustrate the compactification to d=3 by an
embedding of d=4 particle multiplets into the d=3 theory.

applicable to several quantum spin, electron and classical lattice systems. We
show that there may arise chaotic spatial structures in the form of
incommensurate or irregular quantum states and trajectories in space.
  As a first (typical) example we consider a single electron which is strongly
coupled with phonons on a 1D chain of atoms. In the adiabatic approximation the
system is conventionally described by a discrete set of NSEs. Another apt
example is that of superconducting states in layered superconductors described
by the same NSE. Amongst many other applications the typical example for a
classical lattice is a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.
  We reformulate this discrete NSE to the form of a 2D mapping. By this we may
investigate a quantum problem by methods conventionally applied to classical
chaotic dynamics. We find three types of solutions: periodic, quasiperiodic and
chaotic. We then develop a procedure which allows us to obtain numerical
solutions of the NSE directly. This procedure may be used to any arbitrary
accuracy and so these solutions are exact to the degree of precision specified.
Both methods give a consistent result. When applied to our typical example we
find that the wave function of an electron on a deformable lattice (and other
quantum or classical discrete systems) may exhibit incommensurate and irregular
structures.

These operations are: (1) a bijection between semistandard domino tableaux and
certain pairs of ordinary tableaux of the same weight that together fill the
same shape; (2) a weight preserving transformation of domino tableaux to
ordinary tableaux of a related shape (the correspondence involves 2-quotients)

  groups of Lie type","Very minor revisions; same results",,,,"math.NT math.DS",,"  By algebraic group theory, there is a map from the semisimple conjugacy
classes of a finite group of Lie type to the conjugacy classes of the Weyl
group. Picking a semisimple class uniformly at random yields a probability
measure on conjugacy classes of the Weyl group. We conjecture that this measure
agrees with a second measure on conjugacy classes of the Weyl group induced by
a construction of Cellini which uses the affine Weyl group. This conjecture is
confirmed in special cases such as type C odd characteristic and the identity
conjugacy class in type A. Models of card shuffling, old and new, arise
naturally. Type A shuffles lead to interesting number theory involving
Ramanujan sums. It is shown that a proof of our conjecture in type C even
characteristic would give an alternate solution to a problem in dynamical
systems. An idea is offered for how, at least in type A, to associate to a
semisimple conjugacy class an element of the Weyl group, refining the map to
conjugacy classes. This is confirmed for the simplest nontrivial example.

on the zero-point field (ZPF), or electromagnetic quantum vacuum, is promising
in regard to the latter, especially concerning the possibility that the inertia
of matter may, at least in part, be attributed to interaction between the
quarks and electrons in matter and the ZPF. A NASA-funded study (independent of

inertia-generating process at the Compton frequency would simultaneously
explain both the inertial mass of the electron and the de Broglie wavelength of
a moving electron as first measured by Davisson and Germer in 1927. This line
