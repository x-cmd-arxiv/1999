  Suppl. Series",,"10.1051/aas:1999115",,"astro-ph",,"  We present new R filtered CCD observations of 5 faint and moderately faint
asteroids carried out between October, 1998 and January, 1999. The achieved
accuracy is between 0.01-0.03 mag, depending mainly on the target brightness.
The obtained sinodic periods and amplitudes:
  683 Lanzia - 4.6+/-0.2 h, 0.13 mag; 725 Amanda - >3.0 h, >=0.40 mag; 852
Wladilena - 4.62+/-0.01 h, 0.32 mag (December, 1998) and 0.27 mag (January,
1999); 1627 Ivar - 4.80+/-0.01, 0.77 mag (December, 1998) and 0.92 mag
(January, 1999). The Near Earth Object 1998 PG unambiguously showed
doubly-periodic lightcurve, suggesting the possibility of a relatively fast
precession (P_1=1.3 h, P_2=5.3 h).
  Collecting all data from the literature, we determined new models for 3 minor
planets. The resulting spin vectors and triaxial ellipsoids have been
calculated by an amplitude-method. Sidereal periods and senses of rotation were
calculated for two asteroids (683 and 1627) by a modified epoch-method. The
results are:
  683 - lambda_p=15/195+/-25 deg, beta_p=52+/-15 deg, a/b=1.15+/-0.05,
b/c=1.05+/-0.05, P_sid=0.1964156+/-0.0000001 d, retrograde; 852 -
lambda_p=30/210+/-20 deg, beta_p=30+/-10 deg, a/b=2.3+/-0.3, b/c=1.2+/-0.2;

to measure the projected cluster mass function. An optimal mass-selection
requires a quantitative understanding of the noise behavior in mass maps. This
paper is an analysis of the noise properties in mass maps reconstructed using a
maximum likelihood method. The noise power spectrum and the mass error bars are
derived as a straightforward extension of the Kaiser & Squires (1993) algorithm
to the case of a correlated noise. A very good agreement is found between these
calculations and the noise properties observed in maximum likelihood mass
reconstructions limited to simulated non-critical clusters of galaxies. In a
second part, I show that the statistic of peaks in the noise follows accurately
the peak statistics of a two-dimensional Gaussian random field (using the BBKS
technics) if the smoothing aperture contains enough galaxies. This analysis
provides a procedure to derive the significance of any mass peak as a function
of its amplitude and its profile. It is demonstrated that, to a very good
approximation, a mass map is the sum of the lensing signal plus a 2D gaussian
random noise, which means that a detailled quantitative analysis of the
structures in mass maps can be done. A direct application is the measurement of
the projected mass function in wide field lensing surveys, down to small mass
halos which are individually undetectable, this is the subject of a forthcoming
work.

It is suggested that at least some of the observed radio-optical alignment is

slow, dense circumstellar wind (CSW). If the CSW extends sufficiently far from
the progenitor star, then dust formation should occur in the wind. The light
from the supernova explosion will scatter off this dust and produce a light
echo. Continuum emission seen after the peak will have contributions from both
this echo as well as from the shock of the ejecta colliding with the CSW, with
a fundamental question of which source dominates the continuum. We calculate
the brightness of the light echo as a function of time for a range of dust
shell geometries, and use our calculations to fit to the light curves of SN
1988Z and SN 1997ab, the two slowest declining IIn supernovae on record. We
find that the light curves of both objects can be reproduced by the echo model.
However, their rate of decay from peak, color at peak and their observed peak
absolute magnitudes when considered together are inconsistent with the echo
model. Furthermore, when the observed values of M$_{B}$ are corrected for the
effects of dust scattering, the values obtained imply that these supernovae
have unrealistically high luminosities. We conclude that light echoes cannot
properly account for the slow decline seen in some IIn's, and that the shock
interaction is likely to dominate the continuum emission.

co-spatial with the brightest radio hotspot of this very asymmetric radio
source, suggesting extremely strong interaction with dense ambient clouds. The
VLT observations are sufficiently sensitive to detect the continuum flux both
blue-ward and red-ward of the Ly-alpha emission, allowing us to measure the
Ly-alpha forest continuum break (Ly-alpha 'discontinuity', D_A) and the Lyman
limit. We measure a D_A=0.37+-0.1, which is ~0.2 lower than the values found
for quasars at this redshift. We interpret this difference as possibly due to a
bias towards large D_A introduced in high--redshift quasar samples that are
selected on the basis of specific optical colors. If such a bias would exist in
optically selected quasars, - and even in samples of Lyman break galaxies -,
then the space density of both classes of object will be underestimated.
Furthermore, the average HI column density along cosmological lines of sight as

their radio-based selection, we argue that z>4 radio galaxies are excellent

of the binary system. We measure an effective alpha of order 0.1 near the outer
edge of the disk in all of our models, independent of the mass ratio, Mach

theoretically. It is shown that the long range physics of the model is
described by the supersymmetric version of a field theory that has been derived
earlier in connection with lattice fermions subject to weak random hopping.
More precisely, the field theory relevant for the behaviour of n-point
correlation functions is of non-linear sigma model type, where the group
GL(n|n) is the global invariant manifold. It is argued that the model
universally describes the long range physics of random phase fermions and
provides further evidence in favour of the existence of delocalised states in
the middle of the band in two dimensions. The same formalism is applied to the
study of non-Abelian generalisations of the random flux model, i.e. N-component
fermions whose hopping is mediated by random U(N) matrices. We discuss some
physical applications of these models and argue that, for sufficiently large N,
the existence of long range correlations in the band center (equivalent to
metallic behaviour in the Abelian case) can be safely deduced from the RG
analysis of the model.

correspondence law extends to ionic fluids a {\it scaling approximation} (SA)
successfully proposed for nonionic colloids in a recent paper. For the
primitive model of charged hard spheres in a continuum solvent, the partial
structure factors of the monodisperse binary reference system are evaluated by
solving the Orstein-Zernike (OZ) integral equations coupled with an approximate
closure. The SA is first tested within the mean spherical approximation (MSA)
closure, which allows analytical solutions. The results are found in good
overall agreement with exact MSA predictions up to relevant polidispersity. The
SA is shown to be an improvement over the ``decoupling approximation'' extended
to the ionic case. The simplicity of the SA scheme allows its application also
when the OZ equations can be solved only numerically. An example is then given
by using the hypernetted chain (HNC) closure. Shortcomings of the SA approach,

own position. By exploring the coordinate transformation between two Fermi
frames, it is shown that two observers, having the same instantaneous position
and velocity, will observe the same values of covariant fields at their common
instantaneous position, even if they have different instantaneous
accelerations. In particular, this implies that in classical physics the notion
of radiation is observer independent, contrary to the conclusion of some
existing papers. A ""freely"" falling charge in curved spacetime does not move
along a geodesic and therefore radiates. The essential feature of the Unruh
effect is the fact that it is based on a noninstantaneous measurement, which
may also be viewed as a source of effective noncovariance of measured
quantities. The particle concept in Minkowski spacetime is clarified. It is
argued that the particle concept in general spacetime does not depend on the
observer and that there exists a preferred coordinate frame with respect to

""Bose-type"" superconductors that possess two characterstic temperatures and a
pseudogap above $T_c$ is the development approximately comparable with the BCS
theory. One can expect that it should have influence on high-energy physics,
similar to impact of the BCS theory on this subject. Although first
generalizations of this concept to particle physics were made recently, these
results were not systematized. In this review we summarize this development and
discuss similarities and differences of the appearence of the pseudogap phase
in superconductors and the Gross-Neveu and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio - like models. We
discuss its possible relevance for chiral phase transition in QCD and color
superconductors. This paper is organized in three parts: in the first section
we briefly review the separation of temperatures of pair formation and pair
condensation in strong - coupling and low carrier density superconductors (i.e.
the formation of the {\it pseudogap phase}).
  Second part is a review of nonlinear sigma model approach to an analogous
phenomenon in the Chiral Gross-Neveu model at small N. In the third section we
discuss the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model where the chiral phase transition
is accompanied by a formation of a phase analogous to the pseudogap phase.

there are no power law tails at late times. In terms of the AdS/CFT
correspondence, a large black hole corresponds to an approximately thermal
state in the field theory, and the decay of the scalar field corresponds to the
decay of a perturbation of this state. Thus one obtains the timescale for the

follows that the gluon and ghost propagators determined by it, coincides with
the ones used in an alternative of the usual perturbation theory proposed in a

The BRST quantization is done for the value alpha=1 of the gauge parameter
where the procedure is greatly simplified. Therefore, after assuming that the
adiabatic connection of the interaction does not take out the state from the

finite contributions of the pure gauge degrees of freedom. Due to the Gribov
problem the gauge fixing can be defined only locally and the whole space of
gauge potentials has to be partitioned into patches. We discuss a global
extension of the path integral by summing over all patches, which can be proven
to be manifestly independent of the specific local choices of patches and gauge
fixing conditions, respectively. In addition to the formulation on the whole
