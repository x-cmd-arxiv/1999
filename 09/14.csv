rest-frame optical wavelengths, where starlight dominates over the extended,
aligned UV continuum. The NICMOS morphologies are mostly symmetric and are
consistent with dynamically relaxed, elliptical host galaxies dominated by a
red, mature stellar population. The aligned structures are sometimes faintly
visible, and nuclear point sources may be present in a few cases which manifest
the ``unveiled'' AGN that is obscured from view at optical wavelengths. Our
observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the host galaxies of z ~

typical of gE galaxies but smaller than present-day cD and brightest cluster
galaxies, and their surface brightnesses are higher, as expected given simple

Autofib-LDSS redshift surveys are analysed to derive the evolution of the
merger fraction out to z~1. We have performed visual and machine-based merger
identifications, as well as counts of bright pairs of galaxies with magnitude
differences less than 1.5 mag. We find that the pair fraction increases with z,
with up to ~20% of the galaxies being in physical pairs at z~0.75-1. We derive
a merger fraction varying with z as (1+z)^{3.2 +/- 0.6}, after correction for
line-of-sight contamination, in excellent agreement with the merger fraction
derived from the visual classification of mergers for which m = 3.4 +/- 0.6.
After correcting for seeing effects on the ground-based selection of survey
galaxies, we conclude that the pair fraction evolves as (1+z)^{2.7 +/- 0.6}.
This implies that an average L* galaxy will have undergone 0.8 to 1.8 merger
events from z=1 to 0, with 0.5 to 1.2 merger events occuring in a 2 Gyr time
span at z~0.9. This result is consistent with predictions from semi-analytical
models of galaxy formation. From the simple co-addition of the observed
luminosities of the galaxies in pairs, physical mergers are computed to lead to
a brightening of 0.5 mag for each pair on average, and a boost in star
formation rate of a factor of 2, as derived from the average [O II] equivalent
widths. Mergers of galaxies are therefore contributing significantly to the
evolution of both the luminosity function and luminosity density of the
Universe out to z~1.

projection on this shape dependence. We present expressions for the projected

we examine the effects of projection on the predicted bispectrum with
particular attention to the dependence on configuration shape. Except for an

other emission lines anti-correlate strongly with pair spatial separation
(\Delta D) and velocity separation. We use the measured EW(H\alpha) and the
starburst models of Leitherer et al. to estimate the time since the most recent
burst of star for- mation began for each galaxy. In the absence of a large
contribution from an old stellar population to the continuum around H\alpha,
the observed \Delta D -- EW(H\alpha) correlation signifies that starbursts with
larger separations on the sky are, on average, older. By matching the dynamical
timescale to the burst timescale, we show that the data support a simple
picture in which a close pass initiates a starburst; EW(H\alpha) decreases with
time as the pair separation increases, accounting for the anti-correlation.
This picture leads to a method for measuring the duration and the initial mass
function of interaction-induced starbursts: our data are compatible with the
starburst and orbit models in many respects, as long as the starburst lasts
longer than \sim10^8 years and the delay between the close pass and the
initiation of the starburst is less than a few \times 10^7 years. If there is
no large contribution from an old stellar population to the continuum around

a jet-cloud interaction model to explain the major features revealed by the

4C41.17 produces shock-excited emission-line nebulosity through ~1000 km/s
shocks and induces star formation. The CIII to CIV line ratio and the CIV
luminosity emanating from the shock, imply that the pre-shock density in the
line-emitting cloud is high enough (~1-10 cm^-3) that shock initiated star
formation could proceed on a timescale of order a few x 10^6 yrs, well within
the estimated dynamical age of the radio source. Broad (FWHM ~ 100 - 1400 km/s)
emission lines are attributed to the disturbance of the gas cloud by a partial
bow--shock and narrow emission lines (FWHM ~ 500 - 650 km/s) (in particular
CIV) arise in precursor emission in relatively low metallicity gas. The implied
baryonic mass ~ 8 \times 10^{10} solar masses of the cloud is high and implies
that Milky Way size condensations existed in the environments of forming radio
galaxies at a redshift of 3.8. Our interpretation of the data provides a
physical basis for the alignment of the radio, emission-line and UV continuum
images in some of the highest redshift radio galaxies and the analysis
presented here may form a basis for the calculation of densities and cloud
masses in other high redshift radio galaxies.

the ellipsoid of constant angular momentum, in the space $\Omega_1, \Omega_2,
\Omega_3$, has poles corresponding to spinning about the minimal-inertia and
maximal-inertia axes. The first pole may be considered stable if we neglect the
inner dissipation, but becomes unstable if the dissipation is taken into
account. This happens because the bodies dissipate energy when they rotate
about any axis different from principal. In the case of an oblate symmetrical
body, the angular velocity describes a circular cone about the vector of
(conserved) angular momentum. In the course of relaxation, the angle of this
cone decreases, so that both the angular velocity and the maximal-inertia axis
of the body align along the angular momentum. The generic case of an asymmetric
body is far more involved. Even the symmetrical prolate body exhibits a
sophisticated behaviour, because an infinitesimally small deviation of the
body's shape from a rotational symmetry (i.e., a small difference between the
largest and second largest moments of inertia) yields libration: the precession
trajectory is not a circle but an ellipse. In this article we show that often
the most effective internal dissipation takes place at twice the frequency of
the body's precession. Applications to precessing asteroids, cosmic-dust
alignment, and rotating satellites are discussed.

In this paper, the dependence of the dissipation rate on the frequency of the
oscillating source is investigated. The larger the frequency becomes, the more
substantial is the wave dissipation. Implications of our results on the energy
source in molecular clouds are also discussed. Interestingly, since the outflow
lobes associated with young stellar objects act as compact turbulent sources,
hydromagnetic waves are generated by them. From our order-estimations, about
70% of the energy of the outflow itself propagates as waves or turbulences,

visible in the spectra of high redshift objects. Our finding is that grain
velocities are almost independent of ellipticity so that if greyness are due to
the grains being elongated, it will not be possible to separate grey dust from
ordinary dust. We also find that velocities are fairly independent of grain
size, but we cannot rule out possible sputtering of small grains, so that

9.6+/-0.3 keV and a metal abundance of 0.25+/-0.03 in solar units, and with no
evidence of a hard X-ray excess in the PDS spectrum. From the upper limit to
the hard tail component we derive a lower limit of ~0.04 \muG for the
volume-averaged intracluster magnetic field. By performing spatially resolved
spectroscopy in the medium energy band (2-10 keV), we find that the projected
radial temperature and metal abundance profiles are constant out to a radius of
16 arcmin (1.4 Mpc). A reduction of the temperature of 1/3, when going from the
cluster core out to 16 arcmin, can be excluded in the present data at the 99%
confidence level. From the analysis of the temperature and abundance maps we
find evidence of a temperature enhancement and of an abundance decrement in a
region localized 6 arcmin--8 arcmin NE of the core, where a merger event may be
taking place. Finally, the temperature map indicates that the subcluster
located NW of the main cluster may be somewhat cooler than the rest of the
cluster.

been preferentially observed. Dip occurrence was seen to vary strongly with
orbital phase \phi, with a peak at \phi ~ 0.95, i.e. was not symmetric about
phase zero. Secondly, the RXTE ASM has provided continuous coverage of the Low
State of Cygnus X-1 since Sept. 1996, and we have selected dip data based on
increases in hardness ratio. The distribution, with much increased numbers of
dip events, confirms that the peak is at \phi ~ 0.95, and we report the
discovery of a second peak at \phi ~ 0.6. We attribute this peak to absorption
in an accretion stream from the companion star HDE 226868. We have estimated
the ionization parameter at different positions showing that radiative
acceleration of the wind is suppressed by photoionization in particular regions
in the binary system. To obtain the variation of column density with phase, we
make estimates of neutral wind density for the extreme cases that acceleration
of the wind is totally suppressed, or not suppressed at all. An accurate
description will lie between these extremes. In each case, a strong variation
of column density with orbital phase resulted, similar to the variation of dip
occurrence. This provides evidence that formation of the blobs in the wind
which lead to absorption dips depends on the density of the neutral component
in the wind, suggesting possible mechanisms for blob growth.

rotation, assumed uniform, and general relativity. We identify the critical
configuration at which radial instability sets in and determine its structure
in detail. We show that the key nondimensional ratios R/M, T/|W| and J/M^2 (T
is the rotational kinetic energy and W is the gravitational potential energy)
for this critical configuration are universal numbers, independent of the mass,
spin, radius or history of the star. We compare results from an approximate,
analytic treatment with a fully relativistic, numerical calculation and find
good agreement. We solve analytically for the time evolution of these
parameters up to the onset of instability. Cooling by photon radiation drives
the evolution, which is accompanied by mass, angular momentum and entropy loss.
The critical configuration serves as initial data for a future relativistic,
hydrodynamical, 3D simulation of the collapse of an unstable supermassive star.
Since this implosion starts from a universal critical configuration, the
collapse is also uniquely determined and should produce a universal
gravitational waveform. In this paper we briefly speculate on the possible
outcome of this collapse and asses to what extent it offers a promising route
to forming a supermassive black hole.

the resistivity maximum around a metal-insulator transition temperature
$T_0(x)$ into two differently evolving peaks. Unlike the original $Cu$-free
maximum which steadily increases with doping, the second (satellite) peak
remains virtually unchanged for $x<x_c$, increases for $x\ge x_c$ and finally
disappears at $x_m\simeq 2x_c$ with $x_c\simeq 0.03$. The observed phenomenon
is thought to arise from competition between substitution induced strengthening
of potential barriers (which hamper the charge hopping between neighboring $Mn$

not acceptable for investigating the short-range particle correlations in a

thermodynamically consistent and free of the ultraviolet divergences due to

fundamental cut-off and extra dimensions, provide alternative solutions to the
gauge hierarchy problem. However, generating flavor at the TeV scale while
avoiding flavor-changing difficulties appears prohibitively difficult at first
sight. We argue to the contrary that this picture allows us to lower flavor
physics close to the TeV scale. Small Yukawa couplings are generated by
``shining'' badly broken flavor symmetries from distant branes, and flavor and
CP-violating processes are adequately suppressed by these symmetries. We
further show how the extra dimensions avoid four dimensional disasters
associated with light fields charged under flavor. We construct elegant and
realistic theories of flavor based on the maximal U(3)^5 flavor symmetry which
naturally generate the simultaneous hierarchy of masses and mixing angles.
Finally, we introduce a new framework for predictive theories of flavor, where
our 3-brane is embedded within highly symmetrical configurations of
higher-dimensional branes.

spontaneous CP violation. Previous studies, before the recent measurements of
$\epsilon'/\epsilon$, indicated that the model could not accommodate the
experimental values on $\epsilon$ in $K^0-\bar K^0$ mixing, the neutron
electric dipole moment (EDM), the branching ratio of $b\to s \gamma$ and the
upper limit on $\epsilon'/\epsilon$. We point out that these studies were based
on optimistic estimates of the uncertainties in the calculations and that when
more realistic estimates of these errors are used the Weinberg model cannot be
conclusively ruled out from these considerations alone.
  Here we use these realistic error estimates to analyze the present situation
of the Weinberg model. The latest results from Belle and BaBar on $\sin 2
\beta$ allow the small values of this parameter which occur naturally in the
Weinberg model. However, in this model, the recently measured value of
$\Re(\epsilon'/\epsilon) = (1.92\pm 0.25)\times 10^{-3}$ cannot be made
compatible with the branching ratio $B(b\to s \gamma) = (3.15\pm0.54)\times

dysprosium, where one has a pair of nearly degenerate levels of opposite
parity. We consider the time evolution of this two-level system within
oscillatory electric and magnetic fields. These are chosen to have a periodical
structure with the same period, such that a Floquet matrix describes the time
evolution of the quantum states. We show that, if the states are unstable, the
eigenvalues of the Floquet matrix may have contributions proportional to the
square root of the parity violating interaction matrix element $H_w$ while they
are almost degenerate in their parity even part. This leads to beat frequencies
proportional to $\sqrt{H_w}$ which are expected to be larger by several orders
of magnitude compared to ordinary P-violating contributions which are of order
$H_w$. However, for the simple field configurations we considered, it still
seems to be difficult to observe these P-violating beat effects, since the
states decay too fast. On the other hand, we found that, within only a few
Floquet cycles, very large parity violating asymmetries with respect to
experimental setups of opposite chirality may be obtained. The electric and
magnetic fields as well as the time intervals necessary for this are in an
experimentally accessible range. For statistically significant effects beyond
one standard deviation a number of about $10^7$ atoms is required. Our ideas
may be applied directly to other 2-level atomic systems and different field

the number of particles exchanged at a given light-front time. An example
