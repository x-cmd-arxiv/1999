  Goals"", 25-30 July 1999, Boston University",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Planetary systems toward the Galactic Bulge can be detected through
microlensing measurements. The microlensing planet search technique has some
unique merits: low-mass planets can be detected from the ground; the Galactic
family of planetary systems can be sampled unbiased; the time scale for the
completion of each event is relatively short. The unambiguity of the underlying
low-multiplicity point lenses is an indispensable element that allows robust
interpretaion of the events.
  We have found the first circumbinary planet in the microlensing event
MACHO-97-BLG-41. We have found evidence of a low mass planet (few Earths to
Neptune mass) in a very high magnification event MACHO-98-BLG-35. We emphasize
the necessity for coherent searches of microlensing planets with a network of
instruments in the southern hemisphere. The network can also be vitally
instrumental for follow-up observations of SN1a's and GRB's which share with
microlensing planets the transiency as well as the clues to our quest of the
origins.

profiles of the X-ray binary pulsar Hercules X-1. We find that all data are
compatible with the assumption of a slightly distorted magnetic dipole field as
sole cause of the asymmetry of the observed pulse profiles. Further the
analysis provides evidence that the emission from both poles is equal. We
determine an angle of 20 deg between the rotation axis and the local magnetic
axis. One pole has an offset of 5 deg from the antipodal position of the other
pole. The beam pattern shows structures that can be interpreted as pencil- and
fan-beam configurations. Since no assumptions on the polar emission are made,
the results can be compared with various emission models. A comparison of
results obtained from pulse profiles of different phases of the 35-day cycle
indicates different attenuation of the radiation from the poles being
responsible for the change of the pulse shape during the main-on state. These
results also suggest the resolution of an ambiguity within a previous analysis
of pulse profiles of Cen X-3, leading to a unique result for the beam pattern
of this pulsar as well. The analysis of pulse profiles of the short-on state
indicates that a large fraction of the radiation cannot be attributed to the
direct emission from the poles. We give a consistent explanation of both the
evolution of the pulse profile and the spectral changes with the 35-day cycle
in terms of a warped precessing accretion disk.

the Breger polarimeter on the 0.9~m telescope at McDonald Observatory and the
AnyPol polarimeter on the 0.4~m telescope at Limber Observatory, using the
Johnson-Cousins UBVRI broadband filter system. Comparison with earlier
measurements shows no clearly defined long-term polarization variability. For
all 9 stars the wavelength dependence of the degree of polarization in the
optical range can be fit by a normal interstellar polarization law. The
polarization position angles are practically constant with wavelength and are
consistent with those of neighboring stars. Thus the simplest conclusion is
that the polarization of all the program stars is primarily interstellar.
  The O stars chosen for this study are generally known from ultraviolet and
optical spectroscopy to have substantial mass loss rates and variable winds, as
well as occasional circumstellar emission. Their lack of intrinsic polarization
in comparison with the similar Be stars may be explained by the dominance of
radiation as a wind driving force due to higher luminosity, which results in
lower density and less rotational flattening in the electron scattering inner
envelopes where the polarization is produced. However, time series of
polarization measurements taken simultaneously with H-alpha and UV spectroscopy
during several coordinated multiwavelength campaigns suggest two cases of
possible small-amplitude, periodic short-term polarization variability, and
therefore intrinsic polarization, which may be correlated with the more widely
recognized spectroscopic variations.

clusters. This scattering is a function not only of spatial position but also
energy. To perform a correction for these effects we employ Maximum-Likelihood
deconvolution of the image (within energy bands of 1 keV) to determine the
spatial redistribution, followed by a Monte-Carlo energy reassignment of photon
energies with position to determine the spectral redistribution. We present
tests on simulated cluster data, convolved with the various instrumental
characteristics and the X-ray background, which show that our methodology can
successfully recover a variety of intrinsic temperature profiles in typical

  Astronomy and Astrophysics",,,"BAP09-1999-20-DDA","astro-ph",,"  Hubble Space Telescope observations revealed that the central surface
brightness profiles of early type galaxies can be divided into two types:
""core"" profiles and featureless power law profiles. On the basis of this and
previous results, early type galaxies have been grouped into two families:
coreless galaxies, which are also rapidly rotating, nearly isotropic spheroids,
and with disky isophotes, and core galaxies, which are slowly rotating and
boxy-distorted. Here I investigate the relationship between global X-ray
emission and shape of the inner surface brightness profile, for a sample of 59
early type galaxies. I find a clear dicothomy also in the X-ray properties, in
the sense that core galaxies span the whole observed range of Lx values, while
power law galaxies are confined below log Lx (erg/s)=41. Moreover, the relation
between Lx and the shape of the central profile is the strongest among the
relations of Lx with the basic properties characterizing the two families of
early type galaxies. So, a global property such as Lx, that measures the hot
gas content on a galactic scale, turns out to be surprisingly well linked to a
nuclear property. Various possible reasons are explored for the origin of the
different Lx behavior of core and power law galaxies. While a few explanations
can be imagined for the large spread in the X-ray luminosities of core
galaxies, an open problem is why power law ones never become very X-ray bright.
It is likely that the presence of a central massive black hole, and possibly
also the environment, play an important role in determining Lx.

theory of large deviations, we show that if the initial macroscopic average is
constrained to be near a given value, then the macroscopic average at a given

$\bar{r}_s(N,\zeta)$ as a function of $\zeta$ behaves differently depending on
whether $N$ corresponds to a closed-shell or an open-shell cluster. That is,
for a closed-shell one, $\bar{r}_s(N,\zeta)$ is an increasing function of
$\zeta$ over the whole range $0\le\zeta\le 1$, and for an open-shell one, it
has a decreasing part corresponding to the range $0<\zeta\le\zeta_0$, where
$\zeta_0$ is a polarization that the cluster assumes in a configuration
consistent with Hund's first rule.
  In the context of the stabilized spin-polarized jellium model, our
calculations based on these equilibrium $r_s$ values, $\bar{r}_s(N,\zeta)$,
show that instead of the maximum spin compensation (MSC) rule, Hund's first
rule governs the minimum-energy configuration. We therefore conclude that the
increasing behavior of the equilibrium $r_s$ values over the whole range of
$\zeta$ is a necessary condition for obtaining the MSC rule for the
minimum-energy configuration; and the only way to end up with an increasing
behavior over the whole range of $\zeta$ is to break the spherical geometry of
the jellium background. This is the reason why the results based on simple
jellium with spheroidal or ellipsoidal geometries show up MSC rule.

superconductivity with decreasing grain size and parity effect, i.e. dependence
on the parity of the number of electrons on the grain. We study how these
results are affected by degeneracy of energy levels. In addition to the
time-reversal symmetry, for certain energy spectra and more generally for
lattice symmetries, energy levels are strongly degenerate near the Fermi
energy. For a parabolic dispersion, degeneracy d is of the order of k_FL while
the typical distance between the levels is of the order of epsilon_F/(k_FL)^2
where k_F and epsilon_F are the Fermi wave vector and energy, respectively, and
L is the particle size. First, using an exact solution method for BCS
Hamiltonian with finite number of energy levels, for the well studied
non-degenerate case we find a new feature. In that case, parity effect exhibits
a minimum instead of a monotonic behavior. For d-fold degenerate states we find
that the ratio of two successive parity effect parameters Delta_p is nearly
1+1/d. Our numerical solutions for the exact ground state energy of negative U
Hubbard model on a cubic cluster also give very similar results. Hence we
conclude that parity effect is a general property of small Fermi systems with

levels.

and 4-jet hadronic Z decays, in which jets are identified as quark, antiquark
or gluon. The 3-jet Z^0->b\bar{b}g rate is sensitive to the b-quark mass;
prospects for measuring m_b are discussed. The gluon energy spectrum is
measured over the full kinematic range, providing an improved test of QCD and
limits on anomalous bbg couplings. The parity violation in Z^0->b\bar{b}g
decays is consistent with electroweak theory plus QCD. New tests of T- and
CP-conservation at the bbg vertex are performed. A new measurement of the rate
of gluon splitting into b\bar{b} pairs yields
g_{b\bar{b}}=0.0031+-0.0007(stat.)+-0.0006(syst.) (Preliminary). We also
present a number of new results on jet fragmentation into identified hadrons.
The B hadron energy spectrum is measured over the full kinematic range using a
new, inclusive technique, allowing stringent tests of predictions for its shape
and a precise measurement of <x_B>=0.714+-0.005(stat.)+-0.007(syst.)
(Preliminary). A detailed study of correlations in rapidity y between pairs of
identified pions, kaons and protons confirms that strangeness and baryon number
are conserved locally, and shows local charge conservation between meson-baryon
and strange-nonstrange pairs. Flavor-dependent long-range correlations are
observed for all combinations of these hadron species, yielding new information
on leading particle production. The first study of correlations using
rapidities signed such that y>0 corresponds to the quark direction provides
additional new insights into fragmentation, including the first direct
observation of baryon number ordering along the q\bar{q} axis.

Application of our results to the theory of quantum creation of moduli fields
demonstrates that if the moduli mass is smaller than the Hubble constant then
these fields are copiously produced during inflation. This gives rise to the
cosmological moduli problem even if there is no homogeneous component of the
classical moduli field in the universe. To avoid this version of the moduli

at Theta = Pi with two critical endpoints, z1* < z < z2*. We compute the
tension of the domain walls relating the two CP violating vacua. For Mu=Md the

away, CP is restored and the transition becomes of second order. For Nf = 1, CP

mostly interested in the asymptotically flat case we demonstrate how our
procedure works for known examples of non-compact spaces: Eguchi-Hanson metric,
Kerr-Newman metric, Taub-NUT and Taub-bolt metrics and others. Analyzing the
regularization procedure when boundary is not round sphere we observe that our
counterterm helps to cancel large $r$ divergence of the action in the zero and
first orders in small deviations of the geometry of the boundary from that of
the round sphere. In order to cancel the divergence in the second order in
deviations a new quadratic in boundary curvature counterterm is introduced. We
argue that cancelation of the divergence for finite deviations possibly
requires infinite series of (higher order in the boundary curvature) boundary
counterterms.

conservative systems; defined by outgoing-wave boundary conditions, they have
complex eigenvalues. The conditions are studied for a system to have a
supersymmetric(SUSY) partner with the same complex quasinormal-mode spectrum
(or the same except for one eigenvalue). The discussion naturally includes
total-transmission modes as well(incoming at one extreme and outgoing at the
other). Several types of SUSY transformations emerge, and each is illustrated
with examples, including the transformation among different Poschl-Teller
potentials and the well-known identity in spectrum between the two parity
sectors of linearized gravitational waves propagating on a Schwarzschild
background. In contrast to the case of normal modes, there may be multiple
essentially isospectral partners, each missing a different state. The SUSY
transformation preserves orthonormality under a bilinear map which is the
analog of the usual inner product for conservative systems. SUSY
transformations can lead to doubled quasinormal and total-transmission modes;
this phenomenon is analysed and illustrated. The existence or otherwise of SUSY
partners is also relevant to the question of inversion: are open wave systems
uniquely determined by their complex spectra?

subgroup of the isometry group of the complex space form, there is an
essentially unique example that is invariant under this one-parameter subgroup.

the space form is complex 2-space with its standard flat metric, there is an
additional `exceptional' example that has no continuous symmetries but is
invariant under a lattice of translations. Up to isometry and homothety, this
is the unique example with no continuous symmetries.

this arrangement. The corresponding quotient is a smooth manifold Z_P invested
with a canonical action of the compact torus T^m with the orbit space P^n. For
each smooth projective toric variety M^{2n} defined by a simple polytope P^n
with the given lattice of faces there exists a subgroup T^{m-n}\subset T^m
acting freely on Z_P such that Z_P/T^{m-n}=M^{2n}. We calculate the cohomology
ring of Z_P and show that it is isomorphic to the cohomology ring of the face
ring of P^n regarded as a module over the polynomial ring. In this way the
cohomology of Z_P acquires a bigraded algebra structure, and the additional
grading allows to catch the combinatorial invariants of the polytope. At the
same time this gives an example of explicit calculation of the cohomology of
the complement of an arrangement of planes, which is of independent interest.

independent quantities are required to specify the transition amplitude for
this state. It had been shown previously that the set of observables measured
span the allowed space; hence the system is overdetermined, which allowed us to
extract, in a model-independent fashion, each of the individual spin-operator
amplitudes that characterize the reaction. Additional insight into the physical
mechanisms that drive this transition is obtained by mapping out the
momentum-transfer dependence of these amplitudes. We also compare the
