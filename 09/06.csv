those at large redshift. Confidence in the conclusion that there is a
cosmological constant and an accelerating Universe thus still requires the hard
work of sorting out potential systematic effects. Polarization data show that
core-collapse supernovae (Type II and Ib/c) probably depart strongly from
spherical symmetry. Evidence for exceedingly energetic supernovae must be
considered self-consistently with evidence that they are asymmetric, a
condition that affects energy estimates. Jets arising near the compact object
can produce such asymmetries. There is growing conviction that gamma-ray bursts
intrinsically involve collimated or jet-like flow and hence that they are also
strongly asymmetric. SN 1998bw is a potential rosetta stone that will help to
sort out the physics of explosive events. Are events like SN 1998bw more
closely related to ""ordinary"" supernovae or ""hypernovae?"" Do they leave behind
neutron stars as ""ordinary"" pulsars or ""magnetars"" or is the remnant a black
hole? Are any of these events associated with classic cosmic gamma-ray bursts
as suggested by the supernova-like modulation of the afterglows of GRB 970228,

inverse-Compton losses with the microwave background radiation dominates over
synchrotron losses, while the reverse is true for the smaller sources. The

for internal extinction), are comparable to those observed in other galaxies.
No systematic differences in the broad band colours are found for the CNSFR in
the different galaxies, except for those in NGC 3310 which are considerably
bluer, partially due to a younger stellar population. Using theoretical
evolutionary synthesis models some colours can be reproduced by single
populations (between 7 and 300 Myr) and extinction 0.5-1.5 mag). However, in
many cases, the observed equivalent width of Halpha, require a younger
population. NGC 1068, 7177 and 7469, are fitted by a two-burst population model
at solar metallicity; the age difference between both populations is around 5-7
Myr and the younger burst involves 3 - 61% of the total mass of the
cluster,consistent with the younger burst being originated by supernova
activity from the previous one. NGC 3310, requires younger ionizing population
ages and lower metallicity. An excess (R-I) observed/predicted, not consistent
with a normal reddening law can be atributted to red supergiants present in the
older population, and not properly accounted for by the models. The

  M. P. van Haarlem & J. M. van der Hulst (1999)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Seyfert galaxies come in two main types (types 1 and 2) and the difference is
probably due to obscuration of the nucleus by a torus of dense molecular
material. The inner edge of the torus is expected to be ionized by optical and
ultraviolet emission from the active nucleus, and will radiate direct thermal
emission (e.g. NGC 1068) and will cause free-free absorption of nuclear radio
components viewed through the torus (e.g. Mrk 231, Mrk 348, NGC 2639). However,
the nuclear radio sources in Seyfert galaxies are weak compared to radio
galaxies and quasars, demanding high sensitivity to study these effects. We
have been making sensitive phase referenced VLBI observations at wavelengths
between 21 and 2 cm where the free-free turnover is expected, looking for
parsec-scale absorption and emission. We find that free-free absorption is
common (e.g. in Mrk 348, Mrk 231, NGC 2639, NGC 1068) although compact jets are
still visible, and the inferred density of the absorber agrees with the
absorption columns inferred from X-ray spectra (Mrk 231, Mrk 348, NGC 2639). We
find one-sided parsec-scale jets in Mrk 348 and Mrk 231, and we measure low jet
speeds (typically <= 0.1 c). The one-sidedness probably is not due to Doppler
boosting, but rather is probably free-free absorption. Plasma density required
to produce the absorption is N_e >= 2 x 10^5 cm^-3 assuming a path length of
0.1 pc, typical of that expected at the inner edge of the obscuring torus.

Investigations of systems with such principle of a structure formation reveal
that the system's dynamics has typical features of self-organized criticality

dynamics, a power law was found with the index close to 1.4. It is independent

supersymmetric ones, inherently involve complex scalar fields. In the
oscillations of complex scalars, a relative phase between the oscillations in

that have been argued to underly broad-band parametric resonance. In this
paper, we give a treatment of parametric resonance for the decay of homogeneous
complex scalar fields, analyzing properties of the resonance in the presence of
out of phase oscillations of the real and imaginary components. For
phase-invariant coupling of the driving parameter field to the decay field, and
Mathieu type resonance, we give an explicit mapping from the complex resonance
case to an equivalent real case with shifted resonance parameters. In addition,
we consider the consequences of the complex field case as they apply to

resonance in an expanding FRW universe. Applications of our considerations to

duality group is Sp(2n,R) if half of the dimension of space-time is even and
O(n,n) if it is odd. We also discuss duality under the maximal compact

formula that is the conjunction of m clauses of the form (x or y), chosen
uniformly at random from among all 2-clauses on n Boolean variables and their
negations. As m and n tend to infinity in the ratio m/n --> alpha, the problem
is known to have a phase transition at alpha_c = 1, below which the probability
that the formula is satisfiable tends to one and above which it tends to zero.
We determine the finite-size scaling about this transition, namely the scaling
of the maximal window W(n,delta) = (alpha_-(n,delta),alpha_+(n,delta)) such
that the probability of satisfiability is greater than 1-delta for alpha <
alpha_- and is less than delta for alpha > alpha_+. We show that
W(n,delta)=(1-Theta(n^{-1/3}),1+Theta(n^{-1/3})), where the constants implicit
in Theta depend on delta. We also determine the rates at which the probability
of satisfiability approaches one and zero at the boundaries of the window.
Namely, for m=(1+epsilon)n, where epsilon may depend on n as long as |epsilon|
is sufficiently small and |epsilon|*n^(1/3) is sufficiently large, we show that
the probability of satisfiability decays like exp(-Theta(n*epsilon^3)) above
the window, and goes to one like 1-Theta(1/(n*|epsilon|^3)) below the window.
We prove these results by defining an order parameter for the transition and
establishing its scaling behavior in n both inside and outside the window.
Using this order parameter, we prove that the 2-SAT phase transition is
continuous with an order parameter critical exponent of 1. We also determine
the values of two other critical exponents, showing that the exponents of 2-SAT
are identical to those of the random graph.

parametrized by Gelfand--Tsetlin-type patterns. Explicit formulas for the

construction is based on the representation theory of the Yangians. A similar
