determine broad-band temperature and cooling-flow mass-deposition rates for the
106 clusters in our sample, and obtain temperature, abundance and emissivity
profiles (i.e. at least two annular bins) for 98 of these clusters. We find
that 90 percent of these temperature profiles are consistent with isothermality
at the 3-sigma confidence level. This conflicts with the prevalence of
steeply-declining cluster temperature profiles found by Markevitch et al.
(1998) from a sample of 30 clusters. In Paper-III (in preparation) we utilise
our temperature and emissivity profiles to determine radial hydrostatic-mass
properties for a subsample of the clusters presented in this paper.

embedded massive star, which heats an infalling envelope and accretes mass at a
rate high enough to ``choke off'' an incipient HII region. This class of HMCs
would mark the youngest phase known of massive star formation. In order to test
this hypothesis, we model this type of object calculating the radiative
transfer through a spherically symmetric dusty envelope infalling onto a
central OB star, with accretion rates from 0.0006 to 0.001 solar masses per
year. The dust thermal spectrum from infrared to radio wavelengths is derived
and is compared with the observed fluxes of several hot cores which may be
internally heated. We find that the data are best fitted using an envelope with
the density distribution resulting from the collapse of a singular logatropic
sphere, instead of that of a singular isothermal sphere. We conclude that
several of these sources may be undergoing an intense accretion phase and find
in all the cases that the accretion luminosity exceeds the stellar luminosity.

the possible cause of differences observed in the flux ratios of the components

present infrared data. In the two systems B0712+472 and B1030+074 microlensing
has been pinpointed down as the main cause of the flux ratio discrepancy both

substructure revealed in the lensing galaxies. In B0218+357 however the results
are still not conclusive. If we are actually seeing the two ""true"" components

combination of microlensing and reddening or alternatively due to some
variability in at least one of the images. Otherwise the second ""true""

showed the presence of a secondary giant clump, observationally detected by
Bica et al. (1998, AJ, 116, 723). From the collected data we found that most of
the observed field CMDs do not show a separate secondary clump, but rather a
continuous vertical structure (VS), which is clearly seen for the first time.
Its position and size are nearly the same throughout the surveyed regions: it
lies below the Red Giant Clump (RGC) and extends from the bottom of the RGC to
approximately 0.45 mag fainter, spanning the bluest color range of the RGC. The
more numerous the VS stars in a field, the larger the number of LMC giants in
the same zone. Our analysis demonstrate that VS stars belong to the LMC and are
most likely the consequence of some kind of evolutionary process in the LMC,
particularly in those LMC regions with a noticeable large giant population. Our
results suggest that in order to trigger the formation of VS stars, there
should be other conditions besides the appropriate age, metallicity, and the
necessary red giant star density. Indeed, stars satisfying the requisites
mentioned above are commonly found throughout the LMC, but the VS phenomenon is
only clearly seen in some isolated regions. Finally, the fact that clump stars
have an intrinsic luminosity dispersion further constrains the use of the clump
magnitude as a reliable distance indicator.

sight in the Galaxy, using the Short Wavelength Spectrometer on board of the
Infrared Space Observatory. Remarkable variations are seen in the absorption
band profile in the different lines of sight. The main feature is attributed to
13CO2 mixed with polar molecules such as H2O, and CH3OH. Several high-mass
protostars show an additional narrow substructure at 4.382 um, which we
attribute to a polar CO2 ice, that experienced heating. This heating effect is
sustained by a good correlation of the strength of the substructure with dust
and CO gas temperatures along the line of sight, and anti-correlation with ice
abundances. Thus, our main conclusion is that interstellar CO2 ices around
luminous protostars are subjected to, and altered by, thermal processing and
that it may reflect the evolutionary stage of the nearby protostar. In
contrast, the ices around low mass protostars and in a quiescent cloud in our
sample do not show signs of thermal processing. Furthermore, we determine for
the first time the Galactic 12C/13C ratio from the solid state. The 12CO2/13CO2
ratio for the local ISM (69+/-15), as well as the dependence on Galacto-centric
radius, are in good agreement with gas phase (C18O, H2CO) studies. For the few
individual objects for which gas phase values are available, the 12C/13C ratios

sigma significance only). We discuss the implications of this possible

we confirm the earlier simulation results that the inner slope is steeper than

protoplanetary disc from which it formed. Different disc surface density
distributions have been investigated. We focus on the tidal interaction with
the disc with the consequent gap formation and orbital migration of the
protoplanet. Nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations are employed using three
independent numerical codes.
  A principal result is that the direction of the orbital migration is always
inwards and such that the protoplanet reaches the central star in a near
circular orbit after a characteristic viscous time scale of approximately
10,000 initial orbital periods. This was found to be independent of whether the
protoplanet was allowed to accrete mass or not. Inward migration is helped
through the disappearance of the inner disc, and therefore the positive torque
it would exert, because of accretion onto the central star.Our results indicate
that a realistic upper limit for the masses of closely orbiting giant planets
is approximately 5 Jupiter masses, because of the reduced accretion rates
obtained for planets of increasing mass.
  Assuming some process such as termination of the inner disc through a
magnetospheric cavity stops the migration, the range of masses estimated for a
number of close orbiting giant planets (Marcy, Cochran, & Mayor 1999; Marcy &
Butler 1998) as well as their inward orbital migration can be accounted for by
consideration of disc--protoplanet interactions during the late stages of giant
planet formation. Maximally accreting protoplanets reached about four Jovian
masses on reaching the neighbourhood of the central star.

difficulty accounting for the absence of bars in others, it now seems that we
have the opposite problem. Most real galaxies have centres dense enough to
inhibit bar formation, even if they have massive discs. This is also true for
barred galaxies, which therefore could not have acquired their bars as a result
of a self-excited, global instability. There is a hint from the morphology of
galaxies in the Hubble Deep Fields that the growth of bars might be a slow or
secular process. Here I discuss possible mechanisms that could form bars long
after the disc is assembled.

equilibrium chemistry of the gas. Grain nucleation and growth are processes
that depend strongly on the rate of gas-grain collisions. Hence, the drift
velocity becomes an important variable. The tight connection between grain

approximately 12 ks) was observed: at the flare's peak, the X-ray count rate in

parameters of the flaring region have been derived by analyzing the decay,
using both a quasi-static approach and an approach based on hydrodynamic
simulations of decaying flaring loops. This second method shows that the
flare's decay is compatible with its being produced in a relatively compact
region of semi-length L approx. 0.5 stellar radii), large but not exceptional
even by solar standards. The flare decays is fast (with a e-folding time for
the light curve of <= 2 ks), but nevertheless the hydrodynamic-based analysis
shows strong evidence for sustained heating, with the shape of the light curve
dominated by the time evolution of the heating rather than by the natural
cooling of the flaring plasma. The quasi-static method yields a much larger
estimate of the loop's length (L approx. 2 stellar radii). The event shows a
light curve characterized by two separate decay time constants (with the
initial decay being faster) and a significant enhancement in the plasma metal
abundance at the peak of the flare. The energetics of the event are

a scale M due to a nonzero vacuum expectation value of neutral component for
the SU(2)-doublet operator. At virtualities below a cut off \Lambda we
introduce the local higgs approximation for the effective fields of sources
coupled to the composite operators. The value of \Lambda\approx 600 GeV is
fixed by the measured masses of gauge vector bosons. The exploration of
equations for infrared fixed points of calculated Yukawa constants allows us to
evaluate the masses of heaviest fermion generation with a good accuracy, so
that m_t(m_t) = 165\pm 4 GeV, m_b(m_b) = 4.18\pm 0.38 GeV and m_\tau(m_\tau) =

potential are calculated at the scale of matching with the local theory
\Lambda. The fixed point for the Yukawa constant of t quark and the matching

Deser and Jackiw of point particle sources in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with
cosmological constant. Determination of the metric is reduced to finding the
roots of a simple algebraic equation. These roots also determine the nontrivial
""warp factors"" of the metric at the positions of the branes. We discuss the
possible role of these solutions and the importance of ""warp factors"" in the
context of the large extra dimensions scenario.

invariance which in turn univocally fixes the quantum version of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This holds also in the relativistic case, so that we
obtain both the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordon
equation in any dimension. We then show that the EP implies that masses are
related by maps induced by the coordinate transformations connecting different
physical systems. Furthermore, we show that the minimal coupling prescription,
and therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing the EP.
Finally, we show that there is an antisymmetric two-tensor which underlies
Quantum Mechanics and sheds new light on the nature of the Quantum

of large volume compactifications and low string scale. Large longitudinal
dimensions, seen by Standard Model particles, imply in general that string
theory is strongly coupled unless its tension is close to the compactification
scale. Weakly coupled, low-scale strings can in turn be realized only in the
presence of extra large transverse dimensions, seen through gravitational
interactions, or in the presence of infinitesimal string coupling. In the
former case, quantum gravity scale is also low, while in the latter,
gravitational and string interactions remain suppressed by the four-dimensional
Planck mass. There is one exception in this general rule, allowing for large
longitudinal dimensions without low string scale, when Standard Model is
embedded in a six-dimensional fixed-point theory described by a tensionless
string. Extra dimensions of size as large as TeV$^{-1}\simeq 10^{-16}$ cm are
motivated from the problem of supersymmetry breaking in string theory, while
TeV scale strings offer a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem, as an
alternative to softly broken supersymmetry or technicolor. I discuss these
problems in the context of the above mentioned string realizations, as well as
the main physical implications both in particle accelerators and in experiments

electroproduction at photon point on the internal polarized deuterium target at

d(e,pp)X we investigate the reaction channel with an additional neutral pion
production as background to the leading reaction of the single negative pion
production. To study this background process we considered the nucleon pole
mechanism and the two-body mechanism. In the latter mechanism a Delta(1232) and
the pion are produced in one nucleon then the pion is absorbed by other nucleon
producing just one more Delta (1232). The final proton-pion systems come from
the decay of the both Deltas. In this work we have estimated the contribution
of the reaction with additional neutral pion production into the whole yield
for the different polarization states of the deuteron in the kinematic
conditions of the VEPP-3 d(e,pp)X - experiment.

galaxy the potential is the self-gravitating potential, for a liquid drop, the
surface tension energy, and for a nucleus, the potential is the sum of the
