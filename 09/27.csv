minimum jet power of ~10^39 erg/sec and in a symbiotic jet/disk system implies
a minimum accretion rate of a few times 10^-8 M_sun/yr for a radio loud jet or

explained as the nozzle of the outflow. In a symbiotic model this innermost
region of the jet could possibly be identified with the innermost region of an
advection dominated accretion disk, a Bondi-Hoyle accretion flow, or any other
type of under-luminous accretion process. The compact nozzle region is of
particular importance since it can be used as a background photon source
against which the central black hole could be directly imaged with future

which allows the formation of the jet at the innermost edge of the disk
requires a sub-keplerian gas motion and a very large base of the jet. The large
base of the jet may be unrealistic for Sgr A*, since the jet model and the
observations suggest that the jet is collimated and anchored in the disk in a
very narrow region of the disk close to the black hole. Alternatively, one can
think of a jet plus wind model (EDAF), where most of the energy goes out
without being dissipated in the disk. The model resembles the ADAF model at
small radii. At large radii the energy is ejected by a wind.

in the chains is significantly lower than recent 1D estimates based on purely

strong modulation of the nearest neighbour coupling due to the static
distortion $\delta = 0.065$, which is 5 times higher than that previously
deduced from a 1D chain approach. Our set of parameters gives, i) a value of
the distorsion which agreeswell with some recent estimate for a lower bound, we

connectivity topologies give rise to fast system response yet are unable to
produce coherent oscillations in the average activity of the network; on the
other hand, regular connectivity topologies give rise to coherent oscillations
and temporal coding, but in a temporal scale that is not in accordance with
fast signal processing. Finally, small-world (SW) connectivity topologies,
which fall between random and regular ones, take advantage of the best features
of both, giving rise to fast system response with coherent oscillations along
with reproducible temporal coding on clusters of neurons. Our work is the
first, to the best of our knowledge, to show the need for a small-world
topology in order to obtain all these features in synergy within a biologically

a new generation of experiments which can probe the properties of vortex
liquids by forcing them to flow in confined geometries. Such experiments can be
used to distinguish experimentally between continuous disorder-driven glass
transitions of vortex matter, such as the vortex glass or the Bose glass
transition, and nonequilibrium polymer-like glass transitions driven by
interaction and entanglement. For continuous glass transitions, an analysis of
such experiments that combines an inhomogeneous scaling theory with the
hydrodynamic description of viscous flow of vortex liquids can be used to infer
the critical behavior. After generalizing vortex hydrodynamics to incorporate
currents and field gradients both longitudinal and transverse to the applied
field, the critical exponents for all six vortex liquid viscosities are
obtained. In particular, the shear viscosity is predicted to diverge as
$|T-T_{BG}|^{-\nu z}$ at the Bose glass transition, with $\nu\simeq 1$ and
$z\simeq 4.6$ the dynamical critical exponent. The scaling behavior of the ac
resistivity is also derived. As concrete examples of flux flow in confined

gravitational field and in non-inertial reference frames in general requires an
average coordinate and an average proper velocity of light. The need for an
average coordinate velocity of light in non-inertial frames is demonstrated by
considering the propagation of two vertical light rays in the Einstein elevator
(in addition to the horizontal ray originally discussed by Einstein). As an
average proper velocity of light is implicitly used in the Shapiro time delay
(as shown in the Appendix) it is explicitly derived and it is shown that for a
round trip of a light signal between two points in a gravitational field the
Shapiro time delay not only depends on which point it is measured at, but in
the case of a parallel gravitational field it is not always a delay effect. The
propagation of light in rotating frames (the Sagnac effect) is also discussed
and an expression for the coordinate velocity of light is derived. The use of
this coordinate velocity naturally explains why an observer on a rotating disk
finds that two light signals emitted from a point on the rim of the disk and
propagating in opposite directions along the rim do not arrive simultaneously
at the same point.

in the action of free fermions in the moment representation are independent of
the mass and can be factorized from the fermion propagator. However the gauge
couplings suffer from the pathological ghost poles which are common to
non-local actions. This action can be used to find a solution of the Ginsparg
Wilson relation, which is cured from the non-local pathology. Finally we
compare this factorized action with solutions of The Ginsparg Wilson relation.
We find that the present is equivalent to the Zenkin action, and that is not
quite as local as the Neuberger action.

in the graviton, gravitino and 3-form around the flat background, which couple
to the boundary $E_8$ gauge-supermultiplet. They give rise to exchange
amplitudes or forces between both boundary fixed-planes. In leading order of

neither vanish nor cancel each other, thus leading to an attractive force

we derive the complete spectrum of Osp(3|4) X SU(3) multiplets that one obtains
compactifying D=11 supergravity on the unique homogeneous space N^{0,1,0} that
has a tri-sasakian structure, namely leads to N=3 supersymmetry both in the
four-dimensional bulk and on the three-dimensional boundary. As in previously
analyzed cases the knowledge of the Kaluza Klein spectrum, together with
general information on the geometric structure of the compact manifold is an
essential ingredient to guess and construct the corresponding superconformal
field theory. This is work in progress. As a bonus of our analysis we derive
and present the explicit structure of all unitary irreducible representations
of the superalgebra Osp(3|4) with maximal spin content s_{max}>=2.

  The first problem we consider is to construct a $U_h(\g)$ invariant
quantization, $\A_h$, of $\A$, where $U_h(\g)$ is a quantum group corresponding
to G.
  Let s be a G invariant Poisson bracket on M. The second problem we consider
is to construct a $U_h(\g)$ invariant two parameter (double) quantization,
$\A_{t,h}$, of $\A$ such that $\A_{t,0}$ is a G invariant quantization of $s$.
We call $\A_{t,h}$ a $U_h(\g)$ invariant quantization of the Poisson bracket s.
  In the paper we study the cases when G is a simple Lie group and $M$ is the
coadjoint representation $\g^*$ of G or a semisimple orbit in this
representation.

reviewed and contrasted with the standard Hilbert space (HS) theory of quantum
mechanics. The main difference is in the choice of boundary conditions. Whereas
the conventional theory allows for the in-states $\phi^+$ and the out-states
(observables) $\psi^-$ of the S-matrix elements $(\psi^-,\phi^+)=(\psi^{out},S
\phi^{in})$ any elements of the HS $\H$, $\{\psi^-\}=\{\phi^+\}(=\H)$, the RHS
theory chooses the boundary conditions~:
$\phi^+\in\Phi_-\subset\H\subset\Phi_-^\times$, $\psi^-\in\Phi_+\subset
\H\subset \Phi_+^\times$, where $\Phi_-$ ($\Phi_+$) are Hardy class spaces
associated to the lower (upper) half-plane of the second sheet of the
analytically continued S-matrix. This can be phenomenologically justified by
causality. The two RHS's for states $\phi^+$ and observables $\psi^-$ provide
new vectors which are not in $\H$, e.g. the Dirac-Lippmann-Schwinger kets
$|E^{\pm}\in\Phi_{\mp}^{\times}$ (solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation
with $\pm i\epsilon$ respectively) and the Gamow vectors
$|E_R-i\Gamma/2^\pm\in\Phi_{\mp}^\times$. The Gamow vectors $|E_R-i\Gamma/2^-$
have all the properties that one heuristically needs for quasistable states. In
addition, they give rise to asymmetric time evolution expressing
irreversibility on the microphysical level.
