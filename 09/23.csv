an effect of variability. The northern feature is well resolved spatially, so
images have been made showing the distribution of the absorption over a region
of about 1.5 pc on a side, beginning about 1.5 pc from the presumed location of
the central object. That distribution is dominated by a strong decrease with
radial distance. The magnitude of the absoption near 2.5 pc projected distance
from the central object is consistent with a 10^4 K gas with an emission

by ionized gas associated with an accretion disk. The data provide firm
constraints for models of the outer regions of accretion disks and, perhaps,

recovering towards the initial level at the end of the observation.
  BATSE pulse timing measurements indicate that a torque reversal took place
approximately 10 d after this observation. Both the mean pulse profile and the
photon spectrum varied significantly. The observed variation in the source may
provide important clues as to the mechanism of torque reversals.
  The single best-fitting spectral model was based on a component originating
from thermal photons with kT ~ 1 keV Comptonised by a plasma of temperature kT

the evolution of the mean spectra over the course of the observation are
consistent with variations in this model component; with, in addition, a
doubling of the column density nH contributing to the mean spectral change.
  A strong flare of duration 50 s was observed during the interval of minimum
flux, with the peak flux ~ 20 times the mean level. Although beaming effects
are likely to mask the true variation in Mdot thought to give rise to the

with dual episodes of accretion resulting from successive orbits of a locally

importantly, provides direct evidence that hot HB stars and their progeny are
the major contributors to the UV upturn phenomenon observed in ellipticals. Our
image, obtained with STIS, detects ~8000 stars in a 25""x25"" field, centered
7.7"" from the galaxy nucleus. These stars span a range of 21-28 mag in the

complete (25%) to a magnitude of 27. The hot HB spans a range of 25-27 mag at
effective temperatures hotter than 8500 K. We interpret this near-UV luminosity
function with an extensive set of HB and post-HB evolutionary tracks. Although
the UV-to-optical flux ratio in M32 is weak enough to be explained solely by
the presence of post-AGB stars, our image conclusively demonstrates that it
arises from a small fraction (~5%) of the population passing through the hot HB
phase. The majority of the population presumably evolves through the red HB and
subsequent post-AGB phases; however, we see far fewer UV-bright stars than
expected from the lifetimes of canonical hydrogen-burning low-mass post-AGB
tracks. There are several possible explanations: (1) the transition from AGB to
Teff > 60000K could be much more rapid than previously thought; (2) the vast
majority of the post-AGB stars could be evolving along helium-burning tracks;
(3) the post-AGB stars could be surrounded by circumstellar dust during the

layers (QSLs) have to play an important role in magnetic configurations of
solar flares, the corresponding theory is only at an initial stage so far. In
particular, there is still a need in a proper definition of QSL. This problem
is analyzed here on the basis of geometrical properties of the mapping produced
by the field lines which connect photospheric areas of positive and negative
magnetic polarities of active regions. In general, one can find on the
photosphere a unique pair of locally perpendicular line elements at one
footpoint of a given field line, so that this pair is mapped into a similar
pair of elements at the other footpoint. Along the directions of these elements
the field line mapping only stretches and compresses the corresponding
displacements of the neighboring field-line footpoints. This fact enables us to
get a remarkably clear and concise definition of QSL as a volume filled by
coronal field lines for which the ratio of the corresponding stretching and
compressing coefficients is anomalously large. The new definition is also
compared with the ones previously introduced by other authors.
  The theory is applied to flare events of the so-called sigmoid-type, using an
analytical model of a twisted force-free configuration. It is shown that such a
configuration may contain a QSL even if genuine separatrix surfaces are absent.
Identifying QSLs is an essential prerequisite for understanding the mechanism
of magnetic energy release in this type of flares. It is also demonstrated that
the magnetic field under study has a Hamiltonian structure, which makes it
possible to reveal a geometrical reason for the appearance of QSL in this case.

cell a clump or smooth medium status. Cell dimension, clump dust mass and
spatial distribution are derived from the observed properties of Giant
Molecular Clouds and molecular gas in the Galaxy. We produce models for several
values of the optical depth and fraction of the interstellar medium residing in
clumps. As a general result, clumpy models are less opaque than the
corresponding homogeneous models. For the adopted parameters, the increase in
the fraction of energy that escapes the disk is moderate, resulting in surface
brightness profiles that are less than one magnitude brighter than those of the
homogeneous models. The effects of clumping are larger for edge-on views of the
disk. This is in contrast with previous preliminary results for clumping in the
literature. We show how differences arise from the different parametrisation
and clump distribution adopted. We also consider models in which a fraction of
the stellar radiation is emitted within the clumps. In this case, galaxies are
less transparent than in the case when only dust is clumped. The opacity can be
even higher than in the homogeneous case, depending on the fraction of embedded
stellar emission. We point out the implications of the results for the
determination of the opacity and dust mass of spiral galaxies.

strength increases roughly logarithmically with \tau -only- if a shear stress

the particle arrangement under shear stress. Humidity also leads to
strengthening, but is found not to be its sole cause. In addition to these time
dependent effects, the static friction coefficient can also be increased by
compaction of the granular material under some circumstances, and by cycling of

the no-hair theorem has not been proved for the Yang-Mills field. This paper
proves and claims that the superconducting cosmic strings can be connected to
an electrically charged hole when the current inside these strings and black
holes approaches the critical value. Because, this state is the final state of
the gravitational collapse, and the event horizon would be destroyed in this
state. Therefore, these strings should be considered as hair of the charged
black holes, and may be titled as BHCS (Black Hole Connected Strings). This
means that at least the charged black holes have the hair. Thus, the no-hair

the KM matrix; those can be expressed through five KM triangles in addition to
the one usually considered. To test the completeness of the KM description one
has to obtain a highly overconstrained data set sensitive to ${\cal O}(\lambda

(i) Certain large angles agree to leading order only, yet differ in order
$\lambda ^2$ in a characteristic way. (ii) Two observables angles are - for

result of their action on the ground state. We examine the cases in which these
operators carry one-particle one-hole and up to two-particle two-hole

in measurement, not pre-existent objective quantities, and that a measurement
result is strictly a product of the apparatus and the subject of the

measurement of a quantity by an apparatus. These statements can be formalised
as a many valued logic with the structure of a vector space with a hermitian
form in such a way as to generate probabilities in the results of measurement.
The difference between this and classical probability theory is that we are not
finding probabilities generated by unknown variables, but probabilities
generated by unknown structure. We thus interpret quantum logic as the
application of complex truth values to statements in an inaccurate language,
and find that the properties of vector space hold for approximate measurement
as well as for measurement of optimal accuracy, suggesting that Planck's

special relativity using only GCSE level mathematics and ideas. We review the
central derivations, using proofs which are only a little more elegant than
those in Bondi's books, and extend his development to include the scalar
product and the mass shell condition. As used by Bondi, k is the Doppler red
shift, and we extend the k calculus to include the gravitational red shift and
give a derivation of Newton's law of gravity using only 'A' level calculus and
basic quantum mechanics.

trajectories with a large number of different configurations to sample
configuration space. It is expected that these configurations can be classified
into a small number of conformations representing essential changes in the
shape of the molecule. We present a method to visualize these conformations by
point sets in the plane based on a geometrical distance measure between
individual configurations. It turns out that different conformations appear as
well-separated point sets. The method is further improved by performing a
cluster analysis of the data set. The point-cluster representation is used to
control a three-dimensional molecule viewer application to show individual
configurations and conformational changes. The extraction of essential
coordinates and visualization of molecular shape is discussed.

function for the q-deformed boson oscillators and develop an approximate theory
incorporating the zero-point energy. We are then able to demonstrate that for
small deformations, the theory reproduces the correct limits both for very high
temperatures and for very low temperatures. The deformed theory thus reduces to
the undeformed theory in these extreme cases.

correct that the enumeration principle fails in dynamical wavepacket reduction

dynamical reduction process itself prevents the failure of enumeration from
ever becoming manifest, and because one can treat the semantics for dynamical
reduction theories as not adding anything of ontological import to them, it is
reasonable to accept these theories notwithstanding Lewis's counting anomaly.
In their response to our paper (cf. quant-ph/9907050), Bassi and Ghirardi
reject our criticisms of their own response to Lewis, as well as our argument
against Lewis that dynamical reduction precludes failures of enumeration from

particular, the question of the possibility of extracting information about the
relative phase in a quantum wave is analyzed. It is argued that there is a
profound difference in the nonlocal properties of the quantum wave between
fermion and boson particles. The phase of the boson quantum state can be found
from correlations between results of measurements in separate regions. These
correlations are identical to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations
between two entangled systems. An ensemble of results of measurements performed
on fermion quantum waves does not exhibit the EPR correlations and the relative
phase of fermion quantum waves cannot be found from these results. The
existence of a physical variable (the relative phase) which cannot be measured
locally is the nonlocality aspect of the quantum wave of a fermion.
