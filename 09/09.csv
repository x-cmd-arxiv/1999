cosmology and the implications that it may have for the long-term future of
civilizations. Although each civilization is doomed to perish, it may be
possible to transmit its accumulated knowledge to future civilizations. We
consider several scenarios of this sort. If the cosmological constant is
positive, it eventually dominates the universe and bubbles of inflationary
phase begin to nucleate at a constant rate. Thermalized regions inside these
inflating bubbles will give rise to new galaxies and civilizations. It is
possible in principle to send a message to one of them. It might even be
possible to send a device whose purpose is to recreate an approximation of the
original civilization in the new region. However, the message or device will
almost certainly be intercepted by black holes, which nucleate at a much higher
rate than inflating bubbles. Formation of new inflating regions can also be
triggered by gravitational collapse, but again the probability is low, and the
number of attempts required for a positive outcome is enormous. The probability
can be higher if the energy scale of inflation is closer to the Planck scale,
but a high energy scale produces a tight bound on the amount of information
that can be transmitted. One can try to avoid quantum tunneling altogether, but
this requires a violation of quantum inequalities which constrain the magnitude
of negative energy densities. However, the limits of validity of quantum
inequalities are not clear, and future research may show that the required
violation is in fact possible. Therein lies the hope for the future of
civilizations.

to be associated with some feedback mechanism, and probably imply the existence
of a warm IGM containing most of the cosmological baryons. We concentrate on
some possible solutions, mainly photoionization and bulk-heating of the IGM. We
show photoionization can act as a significant feedback mechanism but is not
strong enough to solve the entire overcooling problem. We therefore assume that
the IGM is maintained hot by some energy injection provided by supernova and
galaxy formation is then limited by this feedback mechanism. Such a self
regulated scheme allows us to compute the thermal history of the IGM...

a 1.3 M_sun accreting neutron star. Rather than using analytical expressions
for simple polytropes, we calculated the thermal response of the donor star to
mass loss, in order to determine the stability and follow the evolution of the
mass transfer. Tidal spin-orbit interactions and Reimers wind mass-loss were
also taken into account. We have re-calculated the correlation between orbital
period and white dwarf mass in wide binary radio pulsar systems. Furthermore,
we find an anti-correlation between orbital period and neutron star mass under
the assumption of the ""isotropic re-emission"" model and compare this result
with observations. We conclude that the accretion efficiency of neutron stars
is rather low and that they eject a substantial fraction of the transferred
material even when accreting at a sub-Eddington level. The mass-transfer rate
is a strongly increasing function of initial orbital period and donor star
mass. For relatively close systems with light donors (P < 10 days and M_2 < 1.3
M_sun) the mass-transfer rate is sub-Eddington, whereas it can be highly
super-Eddington by a factor of 10^4 for wide systems with relatively heavy
donor stars (1.6 - 2.0 M_sun) as a result of their deep convective envelopes.
We briefly discuss the evolution of X-ray binaries with donor stars in excess
of 2 M_sun.

of +430 km/s (Johnston, Fender & Wu) for this extreme system. The corresponding
minimum kick velocity is 500 km/s. This is the largest kick needed to explain
the motion of any observed binary system. If Cir X-1 is associated with the
supernova remnant G321.9-0.3 then we find a limiting minimum age of this

in general relativity, we find that for stars rotating at the equatorial
mass-shedding limit, the ISCO is indeed above the stellar surface, for a wide
range of central energy densities at a height equal to 11% of the
circumferential stellar radius, which scales inversely with the square root of
the energy density, of self-bound quark matter at zero presure. In contrast to
static stars, the ISCO frequencies of rapidly rotating strange stars can be as
low as 0.9 kHz for a 1.3 solar mass strange star. Hence, the presence of
strange stars in low-mass X-ray binaries cannot be excluded on the basis of the
currently observed frequencies of kHz QPOs, such as the cut-off frequency of
1066 Hz in 4U 1820-30.

constitutes a manifestation of long-range non-trivial dynamical correlations.
Perturbation theory fails to quantify certain aspects of this effect. In the
perturbative case, for sufficiently weak noise, the diffusion coefficient
${\cal D}$ is just proportional to the noise intensity $\nu$. It is predicted
that in some generic cases one may have a non-perturbative dependence ${\cal
D}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$ with $0.35 < \alpha < 0.38$ for arbitrarily weak noise.
This work has been found relevant to the recently studied ionization of H-atoms
by a microwave electric field in the presence of noise. Note added (a):
Borgonovi and Shepelyansky have adopted this idea of non-perturbative
transport, and have demonstrated that the same effect manifests itself in the
tight-binding Anderson model with the same exponent $\alpha$. Note added (b):
The recent interest in the work reported here comes from the experimental work

model is realized literally. However, the novel effect of non-perturbative

which possesses chiral symmetry breaking and superconducting (Cooper pair
condensates) phases at large-N. At zero temperature and density, the model can
be solved analytically in the large-N limit. We perform the renormalization
explicitly and obtain a closed form expression of the effective potential.
There exists a renormalization group invariant parameter $\delta$ that
determines which of the condensates exist in the vacuum. At finite temperatures
and densities, we map out the phase structure of the model by a detailed
numerical analysis of the renormalized effective potential. For $\delta$
positive and sufficiently large, the phase diagram in the $\mu$-$T$ (chemical
potential-temperature) plane exactly mimics the features expected for QCD with
two light flavors of quarks. At low temperatures there exists low-$\mu$ chiral
symmetry breaking and high-$\mu$ Cooper pair condensate regions which are
separated by a first-order phase transition. At high $\mu$, when the
temperature is raised, the system undergoes a second-order phase transition
from the superconducting phase to an unbroken phase in which both condensates
vanish. For a range of values of $\delta$ the theory possesses a tricritical
point ($\mu_{tc}$ and $T_{tc}$); for $\mu > \mu_{tc}$ ($\mu < \mu_{tc}$) the
phase transition from the low temperature chiral symmetry breaking phase to
unbroken phase is first-order (second-order). For the range of $\delta$ in
which the system mimics QCD, we expect the model to be useful for the
investigation of dynamical aspects of nonequilibrium phase transitions, and to
provide information relevant to the study of relativistic heavy ion collisions

non-trivial scalar fields in the coset space SL(6,R)/SO(6), plus the metric. We
find that the most general supersymmetric solution is parametrized by six real
moduli and analyze its properties using the theory of algebraic curves. In the
generic case, where no continuous subgroup of the original SO(6) symmetry
remains unbroken, the algebraic curve of the corresponding solution is a
Riemann surface of genus seven. When some cycles shrink to zero size the
symmetry group is enhanced, whereas the genus of the Riemann surface is lowered
accordingly. The uniformization of the curves is carried out explicitly and
yields various supersymmetric configurations in terms of elliptic functions. We
also analyze the ten-dimensional type-IIB supergravity origin of our solutions
and show that they represent the gravitational field of a large number of
D3-branes continuously distributed on hyper-surfaces embedded in the
six-dimensional space transverse to the branes. The spectra of massless scalar
and graviton excitations are also studied on these backgrounds by casting the
associated differential equations into Schrodinger equations with non-trivial
potentials. The potentials are found to be of Calogero type, rational or
elliptic, depending on the background configuration that is used.
