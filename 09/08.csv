in particular on two observed quantities: the galaxy redshift distribution at
K<21 and the evolution of the UV luminosity density. The derived photometric
redshift distribution is in agreement with the hierarchical CDM prediction,
with a fraction of only 5% of galaxies detected at z>2. This result strongly
supports hierarchical scenarios where present-day massive galaxies are the
result of merging processes. The observed UV luminosity density in the
I-selected sample is confined within a factor of 4 over the whole range
0<z<4.5. CDM models in a critical Universe are not able to produce the density
of UV photons that is observed at z>3. CDM models in $\Lambda$-dominated
universe are in better agreement at 3<z<4.5, but predict a pronounced peak at
z~1.5 and a drop by a factor of 8 from z=1.5 to z=4 that is not observed in the

has not continued in these galaxies. Since the average H I column density in
these systems is above the threshold for massive star formation, the lack of
such may indicate that these galaxies form some kind of ``optical core'' which
trace a much more extended distribution of neutral hydrogen. A subset of the
detected LSB galaxies have rotational velocities > 200 km s^{-1} and yet are at
least an order of magnitude below L* in total luminosity. As such, they
represent extreme departure from the standard Tully-Fisher relation. In fact,

been measured with HST in four quasars over the last few years, over the
redshift range 2.4 < z < 3.2. These observations have indicated that the HeII
reionization may not have been completed until z\simeq 2.8, and that large
fluctuations in the intensity of the HeII-ionizing background were present
before this epoch. The detailed history of HeII reionization at higher
redshifts is, however, model-dependent and difficult to determine from these
observations, because the IGM can be completely optically thick to Lya photons
when only a small fraction of the helium remains as HeII. In addition, finding
quasars in which the HeII Lya absorption can be observed becomes increasingly
difficult at higher redshift, owing to the large abundance of hydrogen Lyman
limit systems.
  It is pointed out here that HeII in the IGM should also cause detectable
continuum absorption in the soft X-rays. The spectrum of a high-redshift source
seen behind the IGM when most of the helium was HeII should recover from the
HeII Lyman continuum absorption at an observed energy \sim 0.1 keV. Galactic
absorption will generally be stronger, but not by a large factor; the
intergalactic HeII absorption can be detected as an excess over the expected
Galactic absorption from the 21cm HI column density. In principle, this method
allows a direct determination of the fraction of helium that was singly ionized
as a function of redshift, if the measurement is done on a large sample of
high-redshift sources over a range of redshift.

accretion of $\dot M\sim 10^8 M_{\rm Edd}$ onto a neutron star while it is in
common envelope evolution with a massive companion. In order to raise the
temperature high enough that the disc might cool by neutrino emission,
Chevalier found a small value of the $\alpha$-parameter, where the kinematic
coefficient of shear viscosity is $\nu=\alpha c_s H$, with $c_s$ the velocity
of sound and $H$ the disc height; namely, $\alpha\sim 10^{-6}$ was necessary
for gas pressure to dominate. He also considered results with higher values of
$\alpha$, pointing out that radiation pressure would then predominate. With
these larger $\alpha$'s, the temperatures of the accreting material are much
lower, $\lsim 0.35$ MeV. The result is that neutrino cooling during the flow is
negligible, satisfying very well the advection dominating conditions. The low
temperature of the accreting material means that it cannot get rid of its
energy rapidly by neutrino emission, so it piles up, pushing its way through
the accretion disc. An accretion shock is formed, far beyond the neutron star,
at a radius $\gsim 10^8$ cm, much as in the earlier spherically symmetric
calculation, but in rotation. Two-dimensional numerical simulation shows that
an accretion disc is reformed inside of the accretion shock, allowing matter to
accrete onto the neutron star with pressure high enough so that neutrinos can
carry off the energy.

steepens to $f^{-2}$ behavior between a few Hz and ~100 Hz. Above a hundred Hz,
the spectrum shows the QPO features, plus a flat continuum extending to ~1200
Hz and then falling out to ~1800 Hz. These results, which required the
co-adding three days of observations of Cen X-3, are at least as fast as the

investigate environmental influences quantitatively, and find a positive
correlation between L_B/L_X and the local galaxy density. We suggest that this
correlation occurs because the X-ray luminosity is enhanced either through
accretion of the intergalactic gas or because the ambient medium stifles
galactic winds. When the ambient medium is unimportant, partial or global
galactic winds can occur, reducing L_B/L_X. These effects lead to the large
observed dispersion in L_X at fixed L_B. We argue that the transition from
global winds to partial winds is one of the principle reasons for the steep
relationship between L_X and L_B. We discuss details of the data reduction not
previously presented, and examine the dependence of L_X on the choice of outer
source radius and background location. Effects of Malmquist bias are shown not

Magellanic Cloud, we have used a three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation
transfer code to investigate the escape of near-ultraviolet photons from young
stellar associations embedded within a disk of dusty material (i.e. a galaxy).
As photons propagate through the disk, they may be scattered or absorbed by
dust. Scattered photons are polarized and tracked until they escape to be
observed; absorbed photons heat the dust, which radiates isotropically in the
far-infrared, where the galaxy is optically thin. The code produces four output
images: near- UV and far-IR flux, and near-UV images in the linear Stokes
parameters Q and U. From these images we construct simulated UV polarization
maps of the LMC. We use these maps to place constraints on the star + dust
geometry of the LMC and the optical properties of its dust grains. By tuning
the model input parameters to produce maps that match the observed polarization
maps, we derive information about the inclination of the LMC disk to the plane
of the sky, and about the scattering phase function g. We compute a grid of
models with i = 28 deg., 36 deg., and 45 deg., and g = 0.64, 0.70, 0.77, 0.83,

= 36 +2/-5 degrees and g ~0.7. Because of the low signal-to-noise in the data,
we cannot place firm constraints on the value of g. The highly inclined models
do not match the observed centro-symmetric polarization patterns around bright
OB associations, or the distribution of polarization values. Our models
approximately reproduce the observed ultraviolet photopolarimetry of the

scattering this energy independence implies an abundance >130 times less than

sequences of Kolb & Baraffe [1999] imply that the secondaries in many CVs are
expanded compared with main sequence stars of the same mass as a consequence of
unusually high mass transfer rates and/or pre-CV nuclear evolution. We show
that the location of the secondaries of all well-studied CVs in the spectral
type period diagram implies that they are consistent with having near-solar
metallicities. We show, furthermore, that the surface brightness of K/M stars
depends on gravity and metallicity and present new Barnes-Evans relations valid
for dwarfs of near-solar metallicity and the secondaries in CVs of the galactic
disk population. Distances derived by the surface brightness method agree with
recent measurements of the trigonometric parallaxes of a few selected systems.

component. The galaxy has a very diffuse, low surface brightness disk, which
appears to suffer little internal extinction in spite of its edge-on geometry.
The UGC7321 disk shows significant B-R color gradients in both the radial and
vertical directions. These color gradients cannot be explained solely by dust
and are indicative of changes in the mix of stellar ages and/or metallicity as
a function of both radius and height above the galaxy plane. The outer regions
of the UGC7321 disk are too blue to be explained by low metallicity alone
(B-R<0.6), and must be relatively young. However, the galaxy also contains
stellar populations with B-R>1.1, indicating it is not a young or
recently-formed galaxy. The disk of UGC7321 is not a simple exponential, but
exhibits a light excess at small radii, as well as distinct surface brightness
zones. Together the properties of UGC7321 imply that it is an under-evolved
galaxy in both a dynamical and in a star-formation sense. (Abridged)

explicitly given finite constraints. To solve them we propose a notion of rule
consistency that can be expressed in terms of rules derived from the explicit
representation of the initial constraints.
  This notion of local consistency is weaker than arc consistency for
constraints of arbitrary arity but coincides with it when all domains are unary
or binary. For Boolean constraints rule consistency coincides with the closure
under the well-known propagation rules for Boolean constraints.
  By generalizing the format of the rules we obtain a characterization of arc
consistency in terms of so-called inclusion rules. The advantage of rule
consistency and this rule based characterization of the arc consistency is that
the algorithms that enforce both notions can be automatically generated, as CHR
rules. So these algorithms could be integrated into constraint logic
programming systems such as Eclipse.
  We illustrate the usefulness of this approach to constraint propagation by
discussing the implementations of both algorithms and their use on various
examples, including Boolean constraints, three valued logic of Kleene,
constraints dealing with Waltz's language for describing polyhedreal scenes,
and Allen's qualitative approach to temporal logic.

double Pomeron exchange. These distributions have been compared with a model

ingredients for a full lattice definition of non-anomalous chiral gauge

based on earlier work by Callan and Harvey, by Kaplan and by Frolov and
Slavnov. It can be reinterpreted as coming from the Ginsparg-Wilson relation,

way by which Nature itself regularizes chiral fermions. This is yet another

extended to the energy momentum tensor by analogy. It is demonstrated that, at

radioactive nuclei. The nuclei far from stability may reveal new regions of
large deformation. We discuss the influence of the projectile deformation on
the stripping cross sections and longitudinal momentum distributions of the
core. The Glauber formalism for describing such reactions is developed and
compared with the simpler geometric approach and with existing experimental
data. The most significant effects are expected for nuclei with valence
spherical orbitals strongly mixed by deformation. The shape of the momentum
distribution, in turn, can be used for determining the degree of deformation of
the projectile.

Correlated Basis Function perturbation theory, including central and tensor
correlations produceded by a realistic hamiltonian. The factorization property
of the two-nucleon momentum distribution into the product of the two single
nucleon distributions shows up in an analogous property of the spectral
function. The correlated model yields a two-hole contribution quenched whith
respect to Fermi gas model, while the peaks acquire a quasiparticle width that
vanishes as the two momenta approach $k_F$. In addition, three-hole
one-particle and more complicated intermediate states give rise to a
background, spread out in energy and absent in the uncorrelated models. The
possible connections with one- and two-nucleon emission processes are briefly
discussed.

$2N$th moments of a passive scalar advected by a linear shear flow in the form
of an integral over ${\bf R}^N$. In this paper we first compute the asymptotics
of these moments for large moment number. We are able to use this information
about the large N behavior of the moments, along with some basic facts about
entire functions of finite order, to compute the asymptotics of the tails of
the probability distribution function. We find that the probability
distribution has Gaussian tails when the energy is concentrated in the largest
scales. As the initial energy is moved to smaller and smaller scales we find
that the tails of the distribution grow longer, and the distribution moves
smoothly from Gaussian through exponential and ``stretched exponential''. We
also show that the derivatives of the scalar are increasingly intermittent, in
agreement with experimental observations, and relate the exponents of the
scalar derivative to the exponents of the scalar.

Oscillator. Our first results, focusing on circular wave packet motion have
been published recently [2]. The scope of this paper is motion of a linear wave
packet. In relativistic approach we found {\em Zitterbewegung} in spin-orbit
motion (in Dirac representation) due to coupling to negative energy states.
This effect is washed out in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation. Another
important change with respect to non-relativistic case is the loss of
periodicity. The phenomenon reminds the time evolution of population inversion
in Jaynes-Cummings model.

superconductors and estimate in one case and compute in another the rates at
which quantum information stored in these devices ``degrades'' because of
thermal fluctuations. In the case when the entire solid torus is
superconducting, the Boltzmann factor in the rate corresponds to a well-defined
critical fluctuation, and the rate is suppressed exponentially with the linear
size of the system. In the case when superconductivity is confined to the
surface of the torus, the rate is determined by diffusive motion of vortices
around the torus and does not depend exponentially on the linear size; we find,
however, that when the two dimensions of the torus are comparable the rate does
not contain the usual volume enhancement factor, i.e. it does not grow with the
total surface area of the sample. We describe a possible way to write to and
read from this quantum memory.
