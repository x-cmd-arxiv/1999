dust enshrouded starburst galaxies, extreme redshift or dust reddened AGN, or
due to displaced radio lobes. Even deeper radio surveys, which will be made
possible by next generation radio telescopes such as the Expanded VLA or the
Square Kilometer Array, will reach to nanojansky levels which may be dominated
by this new population, but only if special care is taken to achieve high
angular resolution and dynamic range better than 60 dB. This will reuire array
dimensions up to 1000 km to achieve confusion limited performance at 1.4 GHz

convection (the Lighthill mechanism) and linear damping. Convection is treated
with a time-dependent, nonlocal, mixing-length model, which includes both
convective heat flux and turbulent pressure in both the equilibrium model and
the pulsations. Velocity and luminosity amplitudes are computed for stars with
masses between 0.9 M_\sun and 2.0 M_\sun in the vicinity of the main sequence,
for various metallicities and convection parameters. As in previous studies,
the amplitudes are found to increase with stellar mass, and therefore with
luminosity. Amongst those stars that are pulsationally stable, the largest

to calibrate the Hubble diagram of type Ia SNe, i.e. to derive the Hubble

Globular cluster systems of early type Ia host galaxies provide suitable
distance indicators. We discuss how Ia SNe can be calibrated and explain the

relation is fully explained by three kinds of instability: a Parker-type
instability driven by self-gravity, usual Jeans gravitational instability and
convection. In the direction parallel to the magnetic fields, the magnetic
tension completely suppresses the convection. If the adiabatic index $\gamma$
is less than a certain critical value, the perturbations trigger the Parker as
well as the Jeans instability in the disk. Consequently, the growth rate curve
has two maxima: one at small wavenumber due to a combination of the Parker and
Jeans instabilities, and the other at somewhat larger wavenumber mostly due to
the Parker instability. In the horizontal direction perpendicular to the
fields, the convection makes the growth rate increase monotonically upto a
limiting value as the perturbation wavenumber gets large. However, at small
wavenumbers, the Jeans instability becomes effective and develops a peak in the
growth rate curve. Depending on the system parameters, the maximum growth rate
of the convection may or may not be higher than the peak due to the
Jeans-Parker instability. Therefore, a cooperative action of the Jeans and
Parker instabilities can have chances to over-ride the convection and may
develop large scale structures of cylindrical shape in non-linear stage. In
thick disks the cylinder is expected to align its axis perpendicular to the

stochastic, non-linear and time-dependent. Since many observations of galaxy
clustering will be done at high redshift, the time evolution of non-linear
stochastic biasing would play a crucial role for the data analysis of the

compute the one-loop correction of the power spectrum for the total mass, the
galaxies and their cross correlation. Assuming the local functional form for
the initial galaxy distribution, we investigate the time evolution of the
biasing parameter and the correlation coefficient. On large scales, we first
find that the time evolution of the biasing parameter could deviate from the
linear prediction in presence of the initial skewness. However, the deviation
can be reduced when the initial stochasticity exists. Next, we focus on the
quasi-linear scales, where the non-linear growth of the total mass becomes
important. It is recognized that the scale-dependence of the biasing
dynamically appears and the initial stochasticity could affect the time
evolution of the scale-dependence. The result is compared with the recent
N-body simulation that the scale-dependence of the halo biasing can appear on
relatively large scales and the biasing parameter takes the lower value on
smaller scales. Qualitatively, our weakly non-linear results can explain this
trend if the halo-mass biasing relation has the large scatter at high redshift.

problem. Results for the `normal' (r = 0) impurity model are obtained as a
specific case. Particular emphasis is given both to single-particle excitation
dynamics, and to the transition between the strong coupling (SC) and local
moment (LM) phases of the model. Scaling characteristics and asymptotic
behaviour of the SC/LM phase boundaries are considered. Single-particle spectra
are investigated in some detail, for the SC phase in particular. Here, the
modified spectral functions are found to contain a generalized Kondo resonance
that is ubiquitously pinned at the Fermi level; and which exhibits a
characteristic low-energy Kondo scale that narrows progressively upon approach
to the SC->LM transition, where it vanishes. Universal scaling of the spectra
as the transition is approached thus results. The scaling spectrum
characteristic of the normal Anderson model is recovered as a particular case,

different communicative roles within the field. One common claim is that we are

converge on a stable set of electronic forums. A social shaping of technology

disciplinary constructions of trust and of legitimate communication that pull
against convergence. This analysis concludes that communicative plurality and

  LaTeX",,,"SWAT/238","hep-lat",,"  The dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity is investigated in
detail for the first time in five dimensions. In this case, the most general
action that is linear in components of the f-vector has three terms. It was
suspected that the corresponding space of couplings would yield a rich phase
structure. This work is primarily motivated by the hope that this new viewpoint
will lead to a deeper understanding of dynamical triangulations in general.
Ultimately, this research programme may give a better insight into the
potential application of dynamical triangulations to quantum gravity. This
thesis serves as an exploratory study of this uncharted territory.
  The five dimensional (k,l) moves used in the Monte Carlo algorithm are proven
to be ergodic in the space of combinatorially equivalent simplicial
5-manifolds. A statement is reached regarding the possible existence of an
exponential upper bound on the number of combinatorially equivalent
triangulations of the 5-sphere. Monte Carlo simulations reveal non-trivial
phase structure which is analysed in some detail. Further investigations deal
with the geometric and fractal nature of triangulations. This is followed by a
characterisation of the weak coupling limit in terms of stacked spheres. Simple
graph theory arguments are used to reproduce and generalise a well-known result
in combinatorial topology. Finally, a comprehensive study of singular
structures in dynamical triangulations is presented. It includes a new
understanding of their existence, which appears to be consistent with the
non-existence of singular vertices in three dimensions. The thesis is concluded
with an overview of results, general discussion and suggestions for future
work.

rigid body which however cannot be rotationally excited, but in an external
electromagnetic field exhibits a sort of precession with a Larmor type angular
velocity. On the basis of this observation a proposal is made for a new two
steps derivation of the electroweak standard model from the string dynamics. In
the first step a theory of Aristotelian top is formulated and studied in more
detail and in the second step an attempt is made to derive the electroweak
standard model from the top dynamics. Before the symmetry breaking fermions are
represented by straight frozen strings - rotators, whose symmetry under the
rotation around their axes is interpreted as the group $U(1)_Y$. The emergence
of $SU(2)_L$ group is somewhat less transparent and is supposed to be connected
with the new degree of freedom of relativistic rotators, which leads to the up
and down type fermions. The symmetry breaking is associated with the bending of
the rotators under the influence of Higgs field and with their subsequent
transformation into the curved frozen strings - tops. In this new picture of
electroweak interaction the chirality of the theory has a simple and natural
explanation, the weak isospin and hypercharge are inherent properties of
relativistic rotators/tops and the superselection rule associated with electric
charge is a consequence of the accepted distinction between up and down type
fermions.

  University Press",,,"math.DS math-ph math.DG math.MP",,"  This paper considers the problem of characterizing the simplest discrete
point sets that are aperiodic, using invariants based on topological dynamics.
A Delone set whose patch-counting function N(T), for radius T, is finite for
all T is called repetitive if there is a function M(T) such that every ball of
radius M(T)+T contains a copy of each kind of patch of radius T that occurs in
the set. This is equivalent to the minimality of an associated topological
dynamical system with R^n-action. There is a lower bound for M(T) in terms of
N(T), namely N(T) = O(M(T)^n), but no general upper bound.
  The complexity of a repetitive Delone set can be measured by the growth rate
of its repetitivity function M(T). For example, M(T) is bounded if and only if
the set is a crystal. A set is called is linearly repetitive if M(T) = O(T) and
densely repetitive if M(T) = O(N(T))^{1/n}). We show that linearly repetitive
sets and densely repetitive sets have strict uniform patch frequencies, i.e.
the associated topological dynamical system is strictly ergodic. It follows
that such sets are diffractive. In the reverse direction, we construct a
repetitive Delone set in R^n which has
  M(T) = O(T(log T)^{2/n}(log log log T)^{4/n}), but does not have uniform
patch frequencies. Aperiodic linearly repetitive sets have many claims to be
the simplest class of aperiodic sets, and we propose considering them as a
notion of ""perfectly ordered quasicrystal"".

nucleon-nucleon potential. This potential is based on a modified Weinberg power
counting and contains chiral one- and two-pion exchange as well as four-nucleon
contact interactions. The description of the S-waves is very precise. Higher
partial waves are also well reproduced. We also find a good description of most
of the deuteron properties.

"physics/9909008","Doug Snyder","D. M. Snyder","On the Positioning of Objects in Space","13 pages, minor corrections",,,"09-99","physics.gen-ph",,"  The personal spatial structure of an observer is introduced as a central
element in the positioning of objects in space. The link between a reference
frame used by an observer and his personal spatial structure is discussed.
Research on inversion or reversal of incoming light in psychology indicates
that the personal spatial structure of an individual, as well as a reference
frame that he uses, depends on the internal coordination of sensory stimuli and
that the position of objects in space depends in part on psychological factors
that affect one's personal spatial structure. Other research in psychology
demonstrating the flexibility for an observer in determining the direction of
up-down relative to a particular figure, and indeed relative to the entire
surround, is also noted and supports the thesis that the observer plays a role
in the positioning of objects in space.

classical mechanics by reduction of the number of its axiom without engaging
new postulates is formulated. The arising incompleteness of theory manifests
itself in terms of theoretically undefinable fundamental physical constants
$\hbar$ and c. As an example we built up a parametric generalization of
relativistic theory, where the Hubble Law and the dependence of light velocity
on time are obtained.

manifold, a Random Heap, and how this ties up with fractal dimension 2 of a
Quantum Mechanical path. In this light, we can see that there is a harmonious
convergence between the stochastic approach of Nelson and the de Broglie-Bohm
approach. These considerations are shown to lead to the emergence of special
relativity and Quantum Mechanics.

distribution of quantum entanglement and the realization of the required
motional Bell-state analysis.
