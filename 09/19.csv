internal dust. We obtained new HRI data for this object and derive constraints
on the X-ray emitting region of IRAS13349+2438 by investigating its X-ray
extent and lightcurve. Rapid X-ray variability is detected with a factor of two
change in count rate within one day and 20% variability within about three
hours, which practically rules out any significant contribution of scattered
X-rays. We present for the first time a detailed, self-consistent modeling of
the ROSAT PSPC and ASCA spectrum of IRAS13349+2438 in terms of a warm absorber
including dust. It turns out that both a dust-free and a dusty single-component
warm absorber fail to explain the ROSAT, ASCA, and optical data simultaneously.
We discuss possible explanations such as a variable and/or complex warm
absorber, a variable soft X-ray continuum and instrumental effects.

theoretical considerations of this phenomenon up to now have not taken into
account the many-spin nature of molecular magnets. We present, to our
knowledge, the first successful attempt of a realistic calculation of tunneling
splittings for Mn$_{12}$ molecules, thus achieving a quantitatively accurate
many-spin description of a real molecular magnet in the energy interval ranging
from about 100 K down to 10$^{-12}$ K. Comparison with the results of the
standard single-spin model shows that many-spin effects affect the tunneling
splittings considerably. The values of ground state splitting given by
single-spin and many-spin models differ from each other by a factor of five.

equilibrium configurations of compact binary star systems in Newtonian gravity.
Evolutionary processes of compact binary star systems due to gravitational wave
emission can be divided into three stages according to the time scales and
configurations. The evolution is quasi-stationary until a merging process
starts, since the time scale of the orbital change due to gravitational wave
emission is longer than the orbital period. In this stage, equilibrium
sequences can be applied to evolution of compact binary star systems. Along the
equilibrium sequences, there appear several critical states where some
instability sets in or configuration changes drastically. We have discussed
relations among these critical points and have stressed the importance of the
mass overflow as well as the dynamical instability of orbital motions.
Concerning the equilibrium sequences of binary star systems, we have summarized
classical results of incompressible ellipsoidal configurations. Recent results
of compressible binary star systems obtained by the ellipsoidal approximation
and by numerical computations have been shown and discussed. It is important to
note that numerical computational solutions to {\it exact equations} show that
compressibility may lead realistic neutron star binary systems to mass
overflows instead of dynamical disruptions for a wide range of parameters.

dynamics of a system of D0-branes by applying the Wilson renormalization group
equation to the worldsheet partition function of a deformed sigma-model
describing the system, which includes the quantum recoil due to the exchange of
string states between the individual D-particles. We arrive at an effective
Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density with diffusion coefficient
determined by the total kinetic energy of the recoiling system. We use Galilean
invariance of the system to show that there are three possible solutions of the
associated non-linear Schroedinger equation depending on the strength of the
open string interactions among the D-particles. When the open string energies
are small compared to the total kinetic energy of the system, the solutions are
governed by freely-propagating solitary waves. When the string coupling
constant reaches a dynamically determined critical value, the system is
described by minimal uncertainty wavepackets which describe the smearing of the
D-particle coordinates due to the distortion of the surrounding spacetime from
the string interactions. For strong string interactions, bound state solutions
exist with effective mass determined by an energy-dependent shift of the static
BPS mass of the D0-branes.

entwined with each other via the map $\psi:C\otimes A\to A\otimes C$. One
complex is associated to an A-bimodule, the other to a C-bicomodule. In the
former case the resulting complex can be considered as a $\psi$-twisted
Hochschild complex of A, while for the latter one obtains a $\psi$-twist of the
Cartier complex of C. The notion of a {\em weak comp algebra} is introduced by
weakening the axioms of the Gerstenhaber comp algebra. It is shown that such a
weak comp algebra is a cochain complex with two cup products that descend to
the cohomology. It is also shown that the complexes associated to an entwining
structure and A or C are examples of a weak comp algebra. Finally both
complexes are combined in a double complex whose role in the deformation theory
of entwining structures is outlined.
