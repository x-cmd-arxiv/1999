O-C phase diagram of the 71-s signal reveals out-of-eclipse phase variations
resulting from the self eclipses of a nearly edge-on, non-axisymmetric disc. We
work the forward problem of simulating DQ Herculis numerically using the method
of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), and from the time-averaged structure
calculate the O-C phase variations as a function of inclination angle. The WET
and SPH O-C phase variations match to a remarkable degree, and suggest a system
inclination in the range 89.5 to 89.7 degrees.

1/Va method have a significant systematic error for objects close to their
parent sample's flux limit(s). This is particularly noticeable when luminosity
functions are produced for a number of different redshift ranges as is common
in the study of AGN or galaxy evolution. We present a simple method of
constructing a binned luminosity function which overcomes this problem and has
a number of other advantages over the traditional 1/Va method. We also describe
a practical method for comparing binned and model luminosity functions, by
calculating the expectation values of the binned luminosity function from the
model. Binned luminosity functions produced by the two methods are compared for
simulated data and for the Large Bright QSO Survey (LBQS). It is shown that the
1/Va method produces a very misleading picture of evolution in the LBQS. The
binned luminosity function of the LBQS is then compared to a model two power
law luminosity function undergoing pure luminosity evolution from Boyle et al.
(1991). The comparison is made using a model luminosity function averaged over
each redshift shell, and using the expectation values for the binned luminosity
function calculated from the model. The luminosity function averaged in each
redshift shell gives a misleading impression that the model over predicts the
number of QSOs at low luminosity even when model and data are consistent. The
expectation values show that there are significant differences between model
and data: the model overpredicts the number of low luminosity sources at both
low and high redshift. The luminosity function does not appear to steepen
relative to the model as redshift increases.

objects like millisecond pulsars with surface magnetic fields of $\sim
10^{15}-10^{16}$ G are plausible sources of cosmological $\gamma$-ray bursts.
In such winds, there are at least three regions where extremely powerful X-ray
and $\gamma$-ray emission may be generated. The first radiating region is the
wind photosphere that is at a distance of $\sim 10^9$ cm from the compact
object. The second radiating region is at a distance of $\sim 10^{13}-10^{14}$
cm. In this region, the striped component of the wind field is transformed into
large-amplitude electromagnetic waves. The third radiating region is at a
distance of $\sim 10^{16}-10^{17}$ cm, where deceleration of the wind due to
its interaction with an ambient medium becomes important. Radiation from all
these regions is considered.

results show a dependence of the transport properties both on the dielectric
constant of the substrate/underlayer as well as the temperature of quench

these systems. In this paper, we try to correlate the structure of the films to

"quant-ph/9909080","Arnold Neumaier","Arnold Neumaier","Noncommutative analysis and quantum physics I. States and ensembles","38 pages",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc",,"  In this sequence of papers, noncommutative analysis is used to give a
consistent axiomatic approach to a unified conceptual foundation of classical
and quantum physics.
  The present Part I defines the concepts of observables, states and ensembles,
clarifies the logical relations and operations for them, and shows how they
give rise to dynamics and probabilities.
  States are identified with maximal consistent sets of weak equalities in the
algebra of observables (instead of, as usual, with the rays in a Hilbert
space). This leads to a concise foundation of quantum mechanics, free of
undefined terms, separating in a clear way the deterministic and the stochastic
features of quantum physics.
  The traditional postulates of quantum mechanics are derived from
well-motivated axiomatic assumptions. No special quantum logic is needed to
handle the peculiarities of quantum mechanics. Foundational problems associated
with the measurement process, such as the reduction of the state vector,
disappear.
  The new interpretation of quantum mechanics contains `elements of physical
reality' without the need to introduce a classical framework with hidden
variables. In particular, one may talk about the state of the universe without
the need of an external observer and without the need to assume the existence
of multiple universes.

independent variables nor single-valued functionals of data. Second, if the
truncation of singular expansions of solutions is consistent, the truncation
not necessarily leads to the simplest, or elementary, auto-Backlund
