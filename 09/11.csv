trace the intensity of the radiation field in a starburst, we use the ratio of
the 15 to 7 micron flux. Our analysis indicates that this ratio increases as
galaxies move from the pre-starburst to the starburst phase and goes again down
to ~1 in the post-starburst phase, a value typical of normal star forming
regions in galactic disks. Moreover, we find that the variation of this ratio
is well correlated with the one of the IRAS 25micron/12micron and

flare have been detected from 9 normal F and G main sequence stars (Schaefer,
King & Deliyannis 1999). These superflares have durations of hours to days and
are visible from at least x-ray to optical frequencies. The absence of
world-spanning aurorae in historical records and of anomalous extinctions in
the geological record indicate that our Sun likely does not suffer superflares.
In seeking to explain this new phenomenon, we are struck by its similarity to
large stellar flares on RS Canum Venaticorum binary systems, which are caused
by magnetic reconnection events associated with the tangling of magnetic fields
between the two stars. The superflare stars are certainly not of this class,
although we propose a similar flare mechanism. That is, superflares are caused
by magnetic reconnection between fields of the primary star and a close-in
Jovian planet. Thus, by only invoking known planetary properties and
reconnection scenarios, we can explain the energies, durations, and spectra of
superflares, as well as explain why our Sun does not have such events.

produce optical brightenings too small in amplitude to be detected in
disk-integrated brightness. However, we identify nine cases of superflares
involving $10^{33}$ to $10^{38}$ ergs on normal solar-type stars. That is,
these stars are on or near the main-sequence, are of spectral class from F8 to
G8, are single (or in very wide binaries), are not rapid rotators, and are not
exceedingly young in age. This class of stars includes many those recently
discovered to have planets as well as our own Sun, and the consequences for any
life on surrounding planets could be profound. For the case of the Sun,
historical records suggest that no superflares have occurred in the last two

Geometry rules the tunnelling process in the approximation of an incompressible

to tunnelling, we solve explicitly for the two-dimensional motion of a point
vortex in the presence of an ellipse, showing that the hydrodynamic collective
co-ordinate description limits the constant energy paths allowed for the vortex
in configuration space. We outline the experimental procedure used in helium II
to observe tunnelling events, and compare the conclusions we draw to the
experimental results obtained so far. Tunnelling in Fermi superfluids is
discussed, where it is assumed that the low energy quasiparticle excitations
localised in the vortex core govern the vortex dynamical equations. The
tunnelling process can be dominated by Hall or dissipative terms, respectively
be under the influence of both, with a possible realization of this last
intermediate case in unconventional, high-temperature superconductors.

in the kaon and B systems using only the SUSY contributions with vanishing CKM

conserving, forces a negative answer to the above question. This implies that,
even in the regions of the CMSSM where a cancellation of different
contributions to the EDM allows for large SUSY phases, it is not possible to
exploit the SUSY phases to fully account for observable CP violation. Hence to
have sizeable SUSY contributions to CP violation, one needs new flavor
structures in the sfermion mass matrices beyond the usual CKM matrix.

behavior as functions of the angular momentum quantum number and the Hawking
temperature. This behavior is similar to the form of the gray-body factors one
encounters in scattering by black-holes. Our discussion includes the
problematic case of spherically symmetric distributions of D-branes, where
resonances arise. We obtain the same universal form for the absorption
coefficients, if the region enclosed by the D-branes is excluded from physical

similar to the extremal cases, albeit at half the Hawking temperature. We

al. that 1-instanton calculations at strong coupling can be interpreted as
averaging over vacua. Within N=1 SQCD, we point out that the connected
