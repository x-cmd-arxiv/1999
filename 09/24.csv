  Series",,,,"astro-ph",,"  An unbinned statistical test on cluster-like deviations from Poisson
processes for point process data is introduced, presented in the context of
time variability analysis of astrophysical sources in count rate experiments.
The measure of deviation of the actually obtained temporal event distribution
from that of a Poisson process is derived from the distribution of time
differences between two consecutive events in a natural way. The differential
character of the measure suggests this test in particular for the search of
irregular burst-like structures in experimental data. The construction allows
the application of the test even for very low event numbers. Furthermore, the
test can easily be applied in the case of varying acceptance of the detector as
well. The simple and direct use of background events simultaneously acquired
under the same conditions to account for acceptance variations is possible,
allowing for easy application especially in earth-bound gamma-ray experiments.
Central features are the fast and simple calculation of its measure, and the
existence of an analytical approximation that describes the general test
statistics to a high degree of precision.

brightness galaxies (LSBGs) in the optical and the near-infrared. Using stellar
population synthesis models, we find that it is possible to place constraints
on the ratio of young to old stars (which we parameterise in terms of the
average age of the galaxy), as well as the metallicity of the galaxy, using
optical and near-infrared colours. LSBGs have a wide range of morphologies and
stellar populations, ranging from older, high metallicity earlier types to much
younger and lower metallicity late type galaxies. Despite this wide range of
star formation histories, we find that colour gradients are common in LSBGs.
These are most naturally interpreted as gradients in mean stellar age, with the
outer regions of LSBGs having younger ages than their inner regions. In an
attempt to understand what drives the differences in LSBG stellar populations,
we compare LSBG average ages and metallicities with their physical parameters.
Strong correlations are seen between a LSBG's star formation history and its K
band surface brightness, K band absolute magnitude and gas fraction. These
correlations are consistent with a scenario in which the star formation history
of a LSBG primarily correlates with its surface density and its metallicity
correlates both with its mass and surface density.

compromise the absolute ages and metallicities derived in this work, however
our conclusions are robust in a relative sense. We find that most spiral
galaxies have stellar population gradients, in the sense that their inner
regions are older and more metal rich than their outer regions. Our main
conclusion is that the surface density of a galaxy drives its star formation
history, perhaps through a local density dependence in the star formation law.
The mass of a galaxy is a less important parameter; the age of a galaxy is
relatively unaffected by its mass, however the metallicity of galaxies depends
on both surface density and mass. This suggests that galaxy mass-dependent
feedback is an important process in the chemical evolution of galaxies. In
addition, there is significant cosmic scatter suggesting that mass and density
may not be the only parameters affecting the star formation history of a

arises in part from the intrinsically grainy nature of a potential that is
composed of point masses. Even if the potential is assumed to be smooth,
however, orbits in non-axisymmetric galaxies can be chaotic due to the presence
of central density cusps or black holes. The chaotic nature of orbits implies
that perturbations will grow exponentially and this in turn is expected to
result in a diffusion in phase space. We show that the degree of orbital
evolution is not well predicted by the growth rate of infinitesimal
perturbations, i.e. by the Liapunov exponent. A more useful criterion is
whether perturbations continue to grow exponentially until their scale is of
order the size of the system. We illustrate these ideas in a potential
consisting of N fixed point masses. Liapunov exponents are large for all values
of N, but orbits become increasingly regular in their behavior as N increases;
the reason is that the exponential divergence saturates at smaller and smaller
distances as N is increased. The objects which impede diffusion are the
invariant tori. When there are few stable tori, an ensemble of chaotic orbits
evolves rapidly toward a nearly stationary state. This mixing process occurs on
timescales of a few crossing times in triaxial potentials containing massive
central singularities, consistent with the rapid evolution observed in N-body
simulations of galaxies with central black holes.

(1997a,b) during the onset of helium-shell burning at the end of the
horizontal-branch (HB) phase. These instabilities are characterized by
relaxation oscillations within the helium shell which lead to loops in the
evolutionary tracks. We find the occurrence of these instabilities depends
critically on how the breathing pulses are suppressed near the end of the HB
phase. If they are suppressed by omitting the gravitational energy term in the
stellar structure equations, then the helium profile within the core at the end
of the HB phase will contain a broad region of varying helium abundance. The
helium-burning shell which forms in this region is too thick to be unstable,
and gravonuclear instabilities do not occur. If, on the other hand, the
breathing pulses are suppressed by prohibiting any increase in the central
helium abundance, then the final helium profile can exhibit a large
discontinuity at the edge of the helium-exhausted core. The helium shell which
forms just exterior to this discontinuity is then much thinner and can be
thermally unstable. Even in this case, however, the gravonuclear instabilities
disappear as soon as the nuclear burning broadens the helium shell into its
characteristic S-shape. We conclude that the gravonuclear instabilities found
by Bono et al. are a consequence of the ad hoc procedure used to suppress the
breathing pulses.

be coincident with a 2.6 million solar mass point-like object. Its energy
source may be the release of gravitational energy as gas from the interstellar
medium descends into its potential well. Simple attempts at calculating the
spectrum and flux based on this picture have come close to the observations,
yet have had difficulty in accounting for the low efficiency in this source.
There now appear to be two reasons for this low conversion rate: (1) the plasma
separates into two temperatures, with the protons attaining a significantly
higher temperature than that of the radiating electrons, and (2) the magnetic
field, B, is sub-equipartition, which reduces the magnetic bremsstrahlung
emissivity, and therefore the overall power of Sgr A*. We investigate the
latter with improvement over what has been attempted before: rather than
calculating B based on a presumed model, we instead infer its distribution with
radius empirically with the requirement that the resulting spectrum matches the
observations. Our ansatz for B(r) is motivated in part by earlier calculations
of the expected magnetic dissipation rate due to reconnection in a compressed
flow. We find reasonable agreement with the observed spectrum of Sgr A* as long
as its distribution consists of 3 primary components: an outer equipartition
field, a roughly constant field at intermediate radii (~1000 Schwarzschild
radii), and an inner dynamo (more or less within the last stable orbit for a
non-rotating black hole) which increases B to about 100 Gauss. The latter
component accounts for the observed sub-millimiter hump in this source.

adding matter with opposite angular momentum to an existing disc, show that it
is possible for a number of concentric rings with alternating senses of
rotation to co-exist in a disc. This could provide an explanation for the
step-like changes in Pdot which are observed in GX 1+4. Changes at the inner

the implications of the X-ray spectra and of the fact that 1.8 MeV gamma-ray
line emission from the decay of 26Al has been measured from the Vela region
with a certain fraction possibly associated with the new SNR. We estimate an
uncertainty of the age of +-100 yrs for a fixed yield of 44Ti. The highest
values of 44Ti yield provided by current supernova models give worst case upper
limits of 1100 yrs for the age and of 500 pc for the distance. Also the unknown
ionization stage of 44Ti adds to the uncertainty of age and distance which is
atmost another 35% on top. Both the energy balance compiled for the remnant and
yield predictions for 44Ti and 26Al by supernova models favour a core-collapse
event. Two point sources have been found in the vicinity of the explosion
center, either one of these might be the neutron star left by the supernova. If
there is a neutron star the X-ray count- rates of the two point sources provide
an upper limit of the blackbody surface temperature, which is very unlikely to
exceed 3x10E5 K. The supernova might have been observed some 750+-150 yrs ago,

their AGB evolution.
  Derived mass-loss rates span a range from Mdot about 10^-7 to 10^-3 M_sun/yr.
More luminous and cooler stars are found to reach higher mass-loss rates. The
highest mass-loss rates exceed the classical limit set by the momentum of the
stellar radiation field, L/c, by a factor of a few due to multiple scattering
of photons in the circumstellar dust envelope. Mass-loss rates are lower than
the mass consumption rate by nuclear burning, Mdot_nuc, for most of the RSGs.

done reaching the following conclusions: both standard models (i.e. computed by
adopting the Schwarzschild criterion to fix the border of the convective core)
and models with an enlarged convective core (overshooting) lead to a fair fit
of the MS but are not able to reproduce the luminosity and/or the number of He
burning giants. Models including a fraction of 30% of binaries leads to a good
fit both to the MS luminosity function and to the He clump, if standards models
are considered, for a visual distance modulus (m-M)v = 18.8, age t ~ 100 Myr
and mass function slope alpha ~ 2.4, thus largely removing the ""classical""
discrepancy between observed and predicted number of stars in the He burning
clump. The fit obtained with models computed with an enlarged convective core
gets worse when a binary component is taken into account, because the presence
of binary systems increases the existing discrepancy between the observed and
predicted clump luminosity. As a consequence of this analysis, we conclude that
the next step towards a proper understanding of NGC 1866, and similar clusters,
must include the accurate determination of the frequency of binary systems that
will be hopefully performed with the incoming Cycle 8 HST observations of
NGC~1866.

  As the galaxies become brighter in FIR their FIR to UV flux ratio increases:

0.2 microns) per decade of FIR (60 microns) luminosity. This trend is extended

with the opening of a pseudogap on regions of the Fermi surface located near

doping, and in the most underdoped samples, with decreasing temperature. The
spectral weight that is lost at low-energies (omega < 800 cm-1) is transferred

show that each positive tension brane has a localized, decaying cosmological

reason is that the square of the effective expansion rate enters as a source
term in the Einstein equations for the branes.Thus the brane has two scale
factors depending on time and the fifth dimnesion respectively .The brane will
roll along the fifth dimension in order to readjust its effective expansion
rate in such a way that it compensates for its internal energy changes due to
inflation and possible phase transitions.

anti-Dp-branes distributed at different points of the underlying orbifold.
Supersymmetry-breaking is felt by the observable world either directly, by
gravity mediation or gauge mediation, depending on the brane configuration. We
construct several simple three generation examples with the gauge group of the
standard model or its left-right symmetric extensions. The models contain a
number of U(1) gauge groups whose anomalies are cancelled by a generalized
Green-Schwarz mechanism. These U(1)'s are broken but may survive as global
symmetries providing for a flavour structure to the models. The value of the
string scale may be lowered down to the intermediate scale (as required in the
gravity mediation case) or down to 1-100 TeV for the non-SUSY models. Thus the
present models are the first semirealistic string vacua realizing the
possibility of a low string scale. The unbalanced force between the pairs of
Dp- and anti-Dp-branes provides for an effect which tends to compactify some of
the extra dimensions but no others. This could provide a new mechanism for

the vacuum and one-photon states. The method is based on a conditional
double-interferometer fed by an one-photon state and a coherent state. The
scheme involves only linear optical elements and avalanche photodetectors, and
therefore it should be realizable with current technology. A realistic
description of the triggering photodetectors is employed, i.e. we assume that
they can only check, with a certain efficiency, whether or not any photon is
present. We discuss two working regimes, and show that output states with
fidelity arbitrarily close to unit may be obtained, with non vanishing
conditional probability, also for low quantum efficiency at the photodetectors.

the Schwarzian type, i.e. invariant under M\""obius transformations, that is
related to the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. In fact, this PDE can be considered
as the generating equation for the entire hierarchy of Schwarzian KdV
equations. We present its Lax pair, establish its connection with the SKdV
hierarchy, its Miura relations to similar generating PDEs for the modified and
regular KdV hierarchies and its Lagrangian structure. Finally we demonstrate
that its similarity reductions lead to the {\it full} Painlev\'e VI equation,
i.e. with four arbitary parameters.
