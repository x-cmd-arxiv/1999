Submitted to Complex Systems",,,,"adap-org nlin.AO",,"  During the last few years an area of active research in the field of complex
systems is that of their information storing and processing abilities. Common
opinion has it that the most interesting beaviour of these systems is found
``at the edge of chaos'', which would seem to suggest that complex systems may
have inherently non-trivial information proccesing abilities in the vicinity of
sharp phase transitions. A comprenhensive, quantitative understanding of why
this is the case is however still lacking. Indeed, even ``experimental'' (i.e.,
often numerical) evidence that this is so has been questioned for a number of
systems. In this paper we will investigate, both numerically and analitically,
the behavior of Random Boolean Networks (RBN's) as they undergo their
order-disorder phase transition. We will use a simple mean field approximation
to treat the problem, and without lack of generality we will concentrate on a
particular value for the connectivity of the system. In spite of the simplicity
of our arguments, we will be able to reproduce analitically the amount of
mutual information contained in the system as measured from numerical
simulations.

compact object in elliptic orbit about a 10 Msun uniformly rotating main
sequence star for various values of the initial orbital parameters. We apply
our previously published results of 2D non-adiabatic calculations of the
non-radial g- and r-mode oscillations of the uniformly rotating MS star, and
include the effects of resonant excitation of these modes in the tidal
evolution calculations. A high orbital eccentricity enhances the effectiveness
of the tidal interaction because of the large number of harmonic components of
the tidal potential and the reduced orbital separation near periastron. By
including the evolution of the MS star, especially of its rotation rate, many
resonance crossings occur with enhanced tidal interaction. We analyse the
phenomenon of resonance locking whereby a particular tidal harmonic is kept
resonant with a stellar oscillation mode. Resonance locking of prograde g-modes
appears an effective mechanism for orbital circularization of eccentric orbits.
We consider the orbital evolution of the binary pulsar PSR J0045-7319 and
conclude that resonance locking could explain the observed short orbital decay
time of this system if the B-star spins in the direction counter to the orbital
motion.

  Bunker & Wil J. M. van Breugel",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a principal component analysis of galaxy spectra from the CNOC
sample of rich X-ray luminous clusters at 0.18 < z < 0.55. Composite radial
distributions of different stellar populations show strong gradients as a
function of cluster-centric redshift. The composite population is dominated by
evolved populations in the core, and gradually changes to one which is similar
to coeval field galaxies at radii greater than the virial radius. We do not see
evidence in the clusters for an excess of star formation over that seen in the
coeval field. Within this redshift range, significant evolution in the gradient
shape is seen, with higher redshift clusters showing steeper gradients. This
results in larger numbers of younger galaxies seen towards the inner regions of
the clusters-- in effect, a restatement of the Butcher-Oemler effect.
Luminosity density profiles are consistent with a scenario where this
phenomenon is due to a decline over time in the infall rate of field galaxies
into clusters. Depending on how long galaxies reside in clusters before their
star formation rates are diminished, this suggests an epoch for maximal infall
into clusters at z > 0.7. We also discuss alternative scenarios for the
evolution of cluster populations.

wavelength and less than the jet speed. However, normal mode interference can
lead to both stationary and superluminal phase effects. A maximum pressure
fluctuation criterion suggested by numerical simulations of axisymmetric
relativistic jets is used to find the maximum asymmetric jet distortions and
velocity fluctuations. Cyclic transverse velocity fluctuation can lead to
variation in the flow direction on the order of the relativistic beaming angle.
Resulting variation in the Doppler boost factor can lead to significant
brightness asymmetries as helical structures twist around the jet beam. Growth
of these structures is reduced as the jet density, Lorentz factor or Mach
number are increased. Maximum jet distortion is reduced as the Lorentz factor
increases and this suggests a reduction in mass entrainment or other non-linear
disruptive processes that influence the morphological development of radio
sources.

for measuring distances have been developed and refined, and a primary project
of the Hubble Space Telescope has been the accurate calibration of this
difficult-to-measure parameter. The recent progress in these measurements is
summarized, and areas where further work is needed are discussed. Currently,
for a wide range of possible cosmological models, the Universe appears to have
a kinematic age less than about 14 +/- 2 billion years. Combined with current
estimates of stellar ages, the results favor a low-matter-density universe.
They are consistent with either an open universe, or a flat universe with a
non-zero value of the cosmological constant.

not dust by the atmosphere. Abundances for two RV C stars with earlier results

effects of dust-gas separation. Analyses of five RV A stars show that these

observational behavior of spherically symmetric inhomogeneous cosmological
models, which consist of inner and outer homogeneous regions connected by a
shell or an intermediate self-similar region. It is assumed that the present
matter density parameter in the inner region is smaller than that in the outer
region, and the present Hubble parameter in the inner region is larger than
that in the outer region. Then galaxies in the inner void-like region can be
seen to have a bulk motion relative to matter in the outer region, when we
observe them at a point O deviated from the center C of the inner region. Their
velocity $v_p$ in the CD direction is equal to the difference of two Hubble
parameters multiplied by the distance between C and O. It is found also that
the velocity $v_d$ corresponding to CMB dipole anisotropy observed at O is by a
factor $\approx 10$ small compared with $v_p$. This behavior of $v_d$ and $v_p$
is consistent with the observed cosmic flow of cluster galaxies, when the
radius of the inner region and the distance CD are about 200 $h^{-1}$ Mpc and
40 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, respectively, and when the gaps of density and Hubble

a common progenitor geometry for most of the ULIGs: a plunging disk collision
