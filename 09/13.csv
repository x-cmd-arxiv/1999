incompatibility of the position and momentum measurements. This incompatibility
is expressed by the fundamental commutator [x, p_x]=i hbar, or equivalently,
via the Heisenberg's uncertainty principle Delta x Delta p_x sim hbar. A
further stability-related phenomenon where the quantum realm plays a dramatic
role is the collapse of certain stars into white dwarfs and neutron stars.
Here, an intervention of the Pauli exclusion principle, via the fermionic
degenerate pressure, stops the gravitational collapse. However, by the
neutron-star stage the standard quantum realm runs dry. One is left with the
problematic collapse of a black hole. This essay is devoted to a concrete
argument on why the black-hole spacetime itself should exhibit a quantum
nature. The proposed quantum aspect of spacetime is shown to prevent the
general-relativistic dictated problematic collapse. The quantum nature of
black-hole spacetime is deciphered from a recent result on the universal
equal-area spacing [=lambda_P^2 4 ln(3)] for black holes. In one interpretation
of the emergent picture, an astrophysical black hole can fluctuate to
sqrt{pi/ln(3)} approx 1.7 times its classical size, and thus allow radiation
and matter to escape to the outside observers. These fluctuations I conjecture
provide a new source, perhaps beyond Hawking radiation, of intense radiation
from astrophysical black holes and may be the primary source of observed
radiation from those galactic cores what carry black hole(s). The presented
interpretation may be used as a criterion to choose black holes from black hole
candidates.

weak Ly\alpha absorbers at low redshift are explored. Current observations
indicate the existence of a population of gas-rich, low surface brightness
(LSB) galaxies, and these galaxies may have large cross sections for Ly\alpha
absorption. Absorption arising in LSB galaxies may be attributed to HSB
galaxies at larger impact parameters from quasar lines of sight, so that the
observed absorption cross sections of galaxies may seem unreasonably large.
Thus it is not possible to rule out scenarios where LSB galaxies make
substantial contributions to Ly\alpha absorption using direct observations.
Less direct tests, where observational selection effects are taken into account
using simulations, should make it possible to determine the nature of Ly\alpha
absorbers by observing a sample of ~100 galaxies around quasar lines of sight
with well-defined selection criteria. Such tests, which involve comparing
simulated and observed plots of the unidentified absorber fractions and
absorbing galaxy fractions versus impact parameter, can distinguish between
scenarios where absorbers arise in particular galaxies and those where
absorbers arise in gas tracing the large scale galaxy distribution. Care must
be taken to minimize selection effects even when using these tests. Results
from such tests are likely to depend upon the limiting neutral hydrogen column
density. While not enough data are currently available to make a strong
conclusion about the nature of moderately weak absorbers, evidence is seen that
such absorbers arise in gas that is around or between galaxies that are often
not detected in surveys.

features: a well-defined RGB, and a sample of bright blue stars, belonging to a

confirms that this sample of bright stars is consistent with the occurrence of
a star formation episode $\approx0.1$ Gyr ago. In agreement with previous
investigations (Sarajedini et al. 1997; Aparicio et al. 1997), we also find
that this young stellar population is more centrally concentrated than the old
one. By adopting the new calibration of the Tip of the RGB (TRGB) provided by
Salaris & Cassisi (1998) we estimated that the Antlia distance modulus is
$(m-M)_0=25.89\pm0.10$ mag, and therefore a distance $D=1.51\pm 0.07$ Mpc. This
distance determination is $\approx13%$ larger than the values suggested in
previous investigations. By adopting the calibration of the RGB $(V-I)$ color
index as a function of the metallicity, we estimated that the mean metallicity
of Antlia stellar population is of the order of $[Fe/H]\approx-1.3$. The
differential RGB luminosity function shows an excess in the observed counts -at
the $2\sigma$ level- when compared with theoretical predictions. Plain
arguments on the dependence of the TRGB luminosity on stellar age suggest that
this discrepancy might be due to a stellar component with an age approximately

volume-averaged baryon fractions $f_b(r)$ of galaxy clusters with cluster radii
$r$, $f_b(r)$ should asymptotically reach a universal value $f_b(\infty)=f_b$,
provided that clusters are representative of the Universe. In the framework of
hydrostatic equilibrium for intracluster gas, we have derived the necessary
conditions for $f_b(\infty)=f_b$: The X-ray surface brightness profile
described by the $\beta$ model and the temperature profile approximated by the
polytropic model should satisfy $\gamma\approx2(1-1/3\beta)$ and
$\gamma\approx1+1/3\beta$ for $\beta<1$ and $\beta>1$, respectively, which sets
a stringent limit to the polytropic index: $\gamma<4/3$. In particular, a
mildly increasing temperature with radius is required if the observationally
fitted $\beta$ parameter is in the range $1/3<\beta<2/3$. It is likely that a
reliable determination of the universal baryon fraction can be achieved in the
small $\beta$ clusters because the disagreement between the exact and
asymptotic baryon fractions for clusters with $\beta>2/3$ breaks down at rather
large radii ($\ga30r_c$) where hydrostatic equilibrium has probably become
inapplicable. We further explore how to obtain the asymptotic value
$f_b(\infty)$ of baryon fraction from the X-ray measurement made primarily over
the finite central region of a cluster. We demonstrate our method using a
sample of 19 strong lensing clusters, which enables us to place a useful
constraint on $f_b(\infty)$: $0.094\pm0.035 \leq f_b(\infty) \leq 0.41\pm0.18$.
An optimal estimate of $f_b(\infty)$ based on three cooling flow clusters with
$\beta<1/2$ in our lensing cluster sample yields $<f_b(\infty)> =
0.142\pm0.007$ or $\Omega_M = 0.35\pm0.09$.

during dips are complex and cannot be modelled by a simple absorber because of
the clear presence of part of the non-dip spectrum which is not absorbed.
Spectral evolution in dipping can be well modelled by progressive covering of

projection. (3)A stochastic gauge fixing method is developed to study the gauge

problem generally arises for $\theta_{0B}$ (the phase of the B soft breaking
parameter at the GUT scale), if the experimental EDM constraints are obeyed and
radiative breaking of $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ occurs. A D-brane model where
$SU(3)_C\times U(1)_Y$ is associated with one set of 5-branes and $SU(2)_L$

phenomena is studied over the parameter space of the model. Large values of
$\theta_B$ (the phase of B at the electroweak scale) can be accommodated,
though again $\theta_{0B}$ must be fine tuned. Using the conventional
prescription for calculating $d_n$, one finds the region in parameter space

significantly reduced, and generally requires tan$\beta\stackrel{<}{\sim}$5 for

report on a recent analysis of the CP asymmetry in the partial widths for the
non-leptonic decays $B^{\pm} \to M {\bar M} \pi^{\pm}$ ($ M = \pi^+, K ^+,

amplitude with the resonant amplitude for $B^{\pm} \to \chi_{c0} \pi^{\pm} $
followed by the decay $\chi_{c0} \to M {\bar M} $. The CP violating phase
$\gamma$ can be extracted from the measured asymmetry. We find that the partial
width asymmetry for $B^\pm \to \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^\pm$ is about $0.33~\sin
\gamma$, and about $0.45~ \sin \gamma$ for $B^\pm \to K^+ K^-\pi^\pm$, while it
is somewhat smaller for $B^\pm \to \pi^0 \pi^0 \pi^\pm$ and $B^\pm \to \eta

D3-brane background and in its extremal limit, which is a multicenter
configuration of D3-branes distributed uniformly on a disc. In the extremal
background, if the angular momentum of the probe does not vanish, the probe is
always bounced back at some turning point. When its angular momentum vanishes,
in the disc plane, the probe will be captured at the edge of the disc; in the
hyperplane orthogonal to the disc, the probe will be absorbed at the center of
the disc. In the non-extremal background, if the probe is in the hyperplane
orthogonal to the disc, it will be captured at the horizon; if the probe is
restricted in the disc plane, the probe will be bounced back at a turning
point, which is just the infinite red-shift hyperplane of the rotating

thermodynamics of a relative static D3-brane probe is also investigated to the
rotating D3-brane source. Two critical points are found. One is just the
thermodynamically stable boundary of the source rotating D3-branes; the other
is related to the distance between the probe and the source, which can be
regarded as the mass scale in the corresponding super Yang-Mills theory. If the
probe is static, the second critical point occurs as the probe is at the
infinite red-shift hyperplane of the background. The relevance to the

ordinary Yang-Mills field, and we prove that the transformations agree for
large backgrounds. The results are finally used to considerably streamline the

  http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ddw/",,,,"math.GT math.QA",,"  The ``Links-Gould invariant'' is a two-variable Laurent polynomial invariant
of oriented (1,1) tangles, which is derived from the representation of the
braid generator associated with the one-parameter family of four dimensional
representations with highest weights (0,0|a) of the quantum superalgebra
U_q[gl(2|1)]. We use an abstract tensor state model to evaluate the invariant,
as per the construction of the bracket polynomial state model used by Louis
Kauffman to derive the Jones polynomial. This model facilitates both
computation and theoretical exploration.
  Our family of representations has a two-variable quantum R matrix (unique up
to orthogonal transformations). Choosing this R matrix to yield the
representation of the braid generator ensures that our polynomial invariant
will also have two variables. We construct this R matrix from first principles.
We have evaluated the invariant for several critical link examples and numerous
other links of special forms. Throughout, the assistance of Mathematica has
been invoked.
  We observe that the Links-Gould invariant is distinct from the two-variable
HOMFLY polynomial in that it detects the chirality of some links where the
HOMFLY fails. Notably, it does not distinguish inverses, which is not
surprising as we are able to demonstrate that no invariant of this type should
be able to distinguish between inverses. It also does not distinguish between
mutants.

case, namely, one of the spaces is only assumed to be a CAT(0) topological
manifold. As a corollary, we get that any compact irreducible but locally
reducible locally symmetric space of noncompact type does not admit a
nonpositively curved (in the Aleksandrov sense) piecewise Euclidean structure.
Any hyperbolic manifold, on the other hand, does admit such a structure.

The scaling properties of the charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity with
the number of participants are studied using the SPMD and the MIRAC detector.
Neutral pion spectra obtained from the LEDA detector are compared to
hydrodynamical parametrizations. The collective flow in the target
fragmentation region has been studied using the Plastic Ball detector. The
results exhibit a strong dependence on centrality and rapidity.

nuclear matter. Our approach is based on the momentum dependence of the real
part of the total $K^-N$ scattering amplitude, which is fixed in free space by
experimental data, using the dispersion relation approach. We decompose the
contributions to the scattering amplitude from different processes and consider
the $\Lambda$(1405) and $\Sigma$(1385) to be dissolved in nuclear matter at
density $\rho_0$. Within this approach the $K^-$ potential is found to be
attractive up to high kaon momenta. Our result is in line with the data on the
antikaon potential evaluated from the analysis of kaonic atoms (low momenta),
heavy-ion (interdmediate momenta) and proton-nucleus (high momenta) collisions.

fo cusing Kerr media. It is shown that four-wave mixing reinforces the
self-focusi ng of mutually-trapped waves by lowering their power threshold for
collapse, on ly when their phase mismatch is small. On the contrary, walk-off
inhibits the c ollapse by detrapping the beams, whose partial centroids
experience nonlinear o scillations.

ambient magnetic field fluctuations. Motional heating has been measured to be
as low as one vibrational quantum in 190 ms.
