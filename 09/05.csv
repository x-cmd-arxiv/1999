Searches to an average depth of z~0.5 have found approximately 100 SNe Ia to
date, and measurements of their light curves and peak magnitudes find these
objects to be about 0.25mag fainter than predictions for an empty universe.
These measurements imply low values for Omega_M and a positive cosmological
constant, with high statistical significance. Searches out to z~1.0-1.2 for SNe
Ia (peak magnitudes of I~24.5) will greatly aid in confirming this result, or
demonstrate the existence of systematic errors. Multi-epoch spectra of SNe Ia
at z~0.5 are needed to constrain possible evolutionary effects. I band searches
should be able to find SNe Ia out to z~2. We discuss some simulations of deep
searches and discovery statistics at several redshifts.

  and Far Infra-Red Wavelengths","13 pages, 16 figures, uses astrobib.sty. Submitted to MNRAS",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Models invoking large populations of obscured AGN are known to provide good
fits to the spectrum of the X-ray background and the observed soft and hard
X-ray number counts. An important consequence of these models is that
significant quantities of dust are required in order to provide the obscuring
medium, which will be heated by the nuclear radiation from the AGN, and will
radiate in the thermal infra-red. We therefore model the properties of the
dust, and predict the contribution of obscured AGN to the intensity of the far
infra-red background and the sub-mm source counts and redshift distribution, in
order to ascertain whether our models are constrained further by the data
available at these wavelengths. Our conservative models predict a contribution
of between 5 and 15 per cent of the far infra-red background intensity, whereas
if we use more extreme values for several parameters, this value may reach 33
per cent. This suggests that AGN may only form a significant minority of sub-mm
sources, in agreement with the results of spectroscopic follow-up. Our models
thus show that there is no inconsistency between obscured AGN models for the
X-ray background and either sub-mm source counts or the intensity of the far
infra-red background. We further propose that obscured AGN may explain the
sub-mm emission associated with Extremely Red Objects (EROs). Finally, we make
predictions for the redshift distribution of AGN sources detected in faint
sub-mm surveys, which should allow future tests of this obscured AGN model.

galaxies. On the other hand `blank field' imaging in the sub-mm seems to turn
up sources routinely, amongst which some are star forming galaxies at similar

identifications of objects detected using the SCUBA instrument. Here we have
taken the opposite approach, performing sub-mm photometry for a sample of Lyman
break galaxies whose UV properties imply high star formation rates.
  The total signal from our Lyman break sample is undetected in the sub-mm, at
an RMS level of 0.5 mJy, which implies that the population of Lyman break
galaxies does not constitute a large part of the recently detected blank-field
sub-mm sources. However, our one detection suggests that with reasonable SCUBA

a mathematical theory of tension based on graph rigidity theory and introduce
several probabilistic models for this problem. We show that if the ``centers''
of the holes are distributed in R^2 according to Poisson law with parameter
\lambda>0, and the distribution of sizes of the holes is independent of the
distribution of their centers, the tension vanishes on all of R^2 for any value
of \lambda. In fact, it follows from a more general result on the behavior of
iterative convex hulls of connected subsets of R^d, when the initial
configuration of subsets is distributed according to Poisson law and the sizes
of the elements of the original configuration are independent of this Poisson
distribution. For the latter problem we establish the existence of a critical
threshold in terms of the number of iterative convex hull operations required
for covering all of R^d. The processes described in the paper are somewhat
