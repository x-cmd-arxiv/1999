hyperluminous, gravitationally lensed system SMM J02399-0136 (z=2.8) and three
powerful radio galaxies (z~2.5). Extended continuum and emission lines are
detected in all objects. The three radio galaxies present typical spectra with
dominant Lya and weaker CIV1550, HeII1640 and CIII]1909. The spectrum of SMM
J02399-0136 is strikingly different, showing relatively weak Lya and HeII and
strong NV1240 relative to the C lines.
  We find that the weakness of HeII can be explained if the intermediate
density narrow line region (n~10^{5-6} cm^-3 dominates the emission line
spectrum, rather than the more extended low density gas (n<100 cm^-3). The line
ratios of MRC2025-218 suggest that this is also the case in this object.
  MRC2025-218 and SMM J02399-0136 show the largest NV/HeII and NV/CIV values
found in high redshift radio galaxies. The failure of solar abundance models to
explain these line ratios and studies of metal abundances in high redshift
quasars and radio galaxies, suggest that nitrogen is overabundant in the
ionized gas of these objects. Alternative possibilities which we discuss
include NV emission from the broad line region and differential amplification
by a gravitational lens.

torques acting during the early stages of gravitational collapse, and is
predicted from the initial mass distribution using second-order perturbation
theory and the Zel'dovich approximation. We have tested this theory for a flat
hierarchical cosmogony using a large N-body simulation with sufficient dynamic
range to include tidal fields, allow resolution of individual galaxies, and
thereby expand on previous studies. We find relatively good correlation between
the predictions of linear theory and actual galaxy evolution. While structure
formation from early times is a complex history of hierarchical merging,
salient features are well described by the simple spherical-collapse model.
Most notably, we test several methods for determining the turnaround epoch, and
find that turnaround is succesfully described by the spherical collapse model.
The angular momentum of collapsing structures grows linearly until turnaround,
as predicted, and continues quasi-linearly until shell crossing. The predicted
angular momentum for well-resolved galaxies at turnaround overestimates the
true turnaround and final values by a factor of ~3 with a scatter of ~70
percent, and only marginally yields the correct direction of the angular
momentum vector. We recover the prediction that final angular momentum scales
as mass to the 5/3 power. We find that mass and angular momentum also vary

order to derive a value for the Hubble constant, H0, mainly concentrating on an
I-band all-sky survey by Giovanelli and collaborators which consisted of total
I magnitudes and 50% linewidth data for ~550 galaxies in 16 clusters. For
comparison, we also derive the values of H0 using surveys in B-band and V-band
by Bothun and collaborators, and in H-band by Aaronson and collaborators.
Careful comparisons with various other databases from literature suggest that
the H-band data, whose magnitudes are isophotal magnitudes extrapolated from
aperture magnitudes rather than total magnitudes, are subject to systematic
uncertainties. Taking a weighted average of the estimates of Hubble constants
from four surveys, we obtain H0 = 71 +- 4 (random) +- 7 (systematic) km/s/Mpc.
We have also investigated how various systematic uncertainties affect the value
of H0 such as the internal extinction correction method used, Tully-Fisher
slopes and shapes, a possible metallicity dependence of the Cepheid
period-luminosity relation and cluster population incompleteness bias.

light-cone effects on the observed clustering and follows the non-linear
evolution in redshift of the underlying DM correlation function and cluster
bias factor. The conversion of the limiting flux of a survey into the
corresponding minimum mass of the hosting DM haloes is obtained by using
theoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperature and X-ray
luminosity of clusters. Finally, our model is calibrated to reproduce the
observed cluster counts adopting a temperature-luminosity relation moderately
evolving with redshift. We apply our technique to three existing catalogues:
BCS, XBACs and REFLEX samples. Moreover, we consider an example of possible
future space missions with fainter limiting flux. In general, we find that the
amplitude of the spatial correlation function is a decreasing function of the
limiting flux and that the EdS models always give smaller correlation
amplitudes than open or flat models with low matter density parameter. In the
case of XBACs, the comparison with previous estimates of the observational
spatial correlation shows that only the predictions of models with Omega_0m=0.3
are in good agreement with the data, while the EdS models have too low a
correlation strength. Finally, we use our technique to discuss the best
strategy for future surveys. Our results show that the choice of a wide area
catalogue, even with a brighter limiting flux, is preferable to a deeper, but
with smaller area, survey.

difference suggesting that the upper kHz QPO,namely nu_h is an upper hybrid
frequency of the Keplerian oscillator under the influence of the Coriolis force
and the lower kHz QPO is the Keplerian frequency nu_K. Such an oscillator has
two branches characterized by high frequency nu_h (around 1 kHz) and by low
frequency nu_L (around 50 Hz). The frequency nu_L depends strongly on the
angle, delta between the normal to the neutron star disk and Omega - the
angular velocity of the magnetosphere surrounding the neutron star. In the
lower part of the QPO spectrum (around 10 Hz), this model identifies the
frequency of radial viscous oscillations nu_v (previously called ""extra noise
component"") and the break frequency nu_b, which is associated with the
diffusive process in the transition region (the innermost part of the disk).
According to this model, all frequencies (namely nu_h, nu_L, nu_b and nu_v)
have specific dependences on nu_K. This paper focuses on the verification of
the predicted relations. For the source 4U 1728-34, the best theoretical fit is

than larger masses and so are denser on the average. The core of a small mass

sequence of undigested cores in the center of the halo, which have survived the

determines the halo structure in the inner regions. For a flat universe with
$P(k) \propto k^n$, scaling arguments then suggest that the core density
profile is, $\rho \propto r^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha = (9+3n)/(5+n)$. But
whether such behaviour obtains depends on detailed dynamics. We first examine
the dynamics using a fluid approach to the self-similar collapse solutions for
the dark matter phase space density, including the effect of velocity
dispersions. We highlight the importance of tangential velocity dispersions to
obtain density profiles shallower than $1/r^2$ in the core regions. If

unique opportunity to study the details of Fe K line profile. Apart from those
characteristics already noticed in earlier ASCA observations on this object
(Yaqoob et al. 1995): a broad and skewed profile, with a strong peak at about
6.4 keV and a large red wing extending to $\sim$4 - 5 keV, which is remarkably
similar to that of MCG -6-30-15, we also find a weak blue wing extending to
about 8 keV, thanks to the good quality of the data. When fitted by a
relativistic accretion disk line plus a narrow core at 6.4 keV, the data
constrain the accretion disk to be nearly face-on, contrary to the edge-on
geometry inferred from optical and UV observations. However, the extended blue
wing can not be well fitted even after we include corresponding Fe K$\beta$
components. Ni K$\alpha$ line emission by an amount of 12% of Fe K$\alpha$ is
statistically required. An alternative explanation is a model consisting of a
narrow core and two disk lines with inclinations of 58$^{\rm o}$ and 0$^{\rm
o}$, respectively. We suppose that the component with inclination of 58$^{\rm

component with inclination of 0$^{\rm o}$ was scattered into our line of sight
by a Compton mirror, which might be the cool accretion disk corona proposed by

weak gamma-ray burst when the jet accelerates down the stellar density gradient
of a hydrogen-poor photosphere. The matter-dominated jet would be formed
promptly, but requires 5 to 10 s to reach the surface of the progenitor of a
Type Ib/c supernova. During this time, the newly-born neutron star could
contract, spin up, and wind up field lines or turn on an alpha-Omega dynamo. In
addition, the light cylinder will contract from a radius large compared to the
Alfven radius to a size comparable to that of the neutron star. This will
disrupt the structure of any organized dipole field and promote the generation
of ultrarelativistic MHD waves (UMHDW) at high density and Large Amplitude
Electromagnetic Waves (LAEMW) at low density. The generation of the these waves
would be delayed by the cooling time of the neutron star about 5 to 10 seconds,
but the propagation time is short so the UMHDW could arrive at the surface at
about the same time as the matter jet. In the density gradient of the star and
the matter jet, the intense flux of UMHDW and LAEMW could drive shocks,
generate pions by proton-proton collision, or create electron/positron pairs
depending on the circumstances. The UMHDW and LAEMW could influence the
dynamics of the explosion and might also tend to flow out the rotation axis to
produce a collimated gamma-ray burst.

characterized by circuits composed of comparator gates. CC-completeness is
believed to imply that, in the worst case, growing a cluster of size n requires
polynomial time in n even on a parallel computer.
  A parallel relaxation algorithm is presented that uses the fact that clusters
are nearly spherical to guess the cluster from a given set of paths, and then
corrects defects in the guessed cluster through a non-local annihilation
process. The parallel running time of the relaxation algorithm for
two-dimensional internal DLA is studied by simulating it on a serial computer.

  For a parallel machine with k processors, we show that random clusters in d
dimensions can be generated in O((n/k + log k) n^{2/d}) steps. This is a
significant speedup over explicit sequential simulation, which takes
O(n^{1+2/d}) time on average.
  Finally, we show that in one dimension internal DLA can be predicted in O(log
n) parallel time, and so is in the complexity class NC.

not however affect the particle abundance. Existing estimates are confirmed;
the abundance of modulini and (probably) of moduli created from the vacuum is

can use the upper bounds on lepton flavor violating tau decays or on lepton
universality violation to put severe, model-independent bounds on the relevant

\bar s$ decay amplitude cannot have significant contributions from New Physics
and is, therefore, CP conserving to a good approximation. We examine this
assumption in two ways. First, we calculate the contributions to the decay in
various relevant models of New Physics: Supersymmetry without R-parity,
multi-scalar models, left-right symmetric models, and models with extra quarks.
We find that phenomenological constraints imply that the New Physics
contributions are indeed small compared to the standard model doubly Cabibbo

100 Mpc or more, they provide an unusually long baseline for possible detection
of $\nu_\mu \to \nu_\tau$ with mixing parameters $\Delta m^2$ down to
$10^{-17}$eV$^2$, many orders of magnitude below the current accelerator
experiments. By solving the coupled transport equations, we show that
high-energy $\nu_\tau$'s, as they propagate through the earth, cascade down in
energy, producing the enhancement of the incoming $\nu_\tau$ flux in the low
energy region, in contrast to the high-energy $\nu_\mu$'s, which get absorbed.
For an AGN quasar model we find the $\nu_\tau$ flux to be a factor of 2 to 2.5
larger than the incoming flux in the energy range between $10^2$ GeV and $10^4$
GeV, while for a GRB fireball model, the enhancement is 10%-27% in the same
energy range and for zero nadir angle. This enhancement decreases with larger
nadir angle, thus providing a novel way to search for $\nu_\tau$ appearance by
measuring the angular dependence of the muons. To illustrate how the cascade
effect and the $\nu_\tau$ final flux depend on the steepness of the incoming
$\nu_\tau$, we show the energy and angular distributions for several generic
cases of the incoming tau neutrino flux, $F_\nu^0 \sim E^{-n}$ for n=1,2 and
3.6. We show that for the incoming flux that is not too steep, the signal for
the appearance of high-energy $\nu_\tau$ is the enhanced production of lower
energy $\mu$ and their distinctive angular dependence, due to the contribution
from the $\tau$ decay into $\mu$ just below the detector.

ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions is presented with emphasis on the
effects of bremsstrahlung processes in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).
Bremsstrahlung photon production in the quark-gluon plasma has recently been
considered within the Braaten-Pisarski method in thermal QCD, where rates have
been found that exhibit the same order in the coupling constants as those
describing the lowest order processes, Compton scattering and
q\bar{q}-annihilation. The impact of these bremsstrahlung photon production
rates on the thermal photon spectra is studied systematically within a simple,
well understood one-fluid hydrodynamical model that describes an only
longitudinally expanding fireball (1+1 Bjorken scaling hydrodynamics). It is
found that the bremsstrahlung processes enhance the thermal photon yield from
the QGP by about one order of magnitude over the complete considered
p_{\perp}-range independent of the choice of the model parameters. Experimental
upper limits on direct photon production in fixed target 200 A GeV S + Au
collisions at the CERN SPS are also considered and used to extract upper limits
for the initial temperature of the QGP, where the QGP bremsstrahlung processes
are found to make a difference of about 15 to 20 MeV depending on the
temperature at which the phase transition is assumed. In comparison with other
theoretical studies, the importance of reaction features not described in the
simple model are estimated and interesting elements for a future extension of
this systematic investigation are identified, which will be of great interest
in prospect of the upcoming experiments at the BNL RHIC and the CERN LHC.

system for the exclusive $p p \to K^+ \Lambda p$ reaction with the aim of
studying the final state interaction between the $\Lambda$-hyperon and the
proton. The reaction is described within a meson exchange framework and the
final state $\Lambda p$ interaction is incorporated through an off-shell
t-matrix for the $\Lambda p \to \Lambda p$ scattering, constructed using the
available hyperon-nucleon (YN) potentials. The cross sections are found to be
sensitive to the type of YN potential used especially at the $\Lambda$ and
$\Sigma$ production thresholds. Hence, data on this exclusive reaction, which
can be used to constrain the YN potentials are desirable.

$^{141}$Nd and $^{143}$Sm) is studied by means of the ($\gamma, n)$ reaction.
This quantity measures a probability to populate the isomeric state in respect
to the ground state population. In ($\gamma, n)$ reactions, the giant dipole
resonance (GDR) is excited and after its decay by a neutron emission, the
nucleus has an excitation energy of a few MeV. The forthcoming $\gamma$ decay
by direct or cascade transitions deexcites the nucleus into an isomeric or
ground state. It has been observed experimentally that the IR for $^{137}$Ba
and $ ^{139}$Ce equals about 0.13 while in two heavier isotones it is even less
than half the size. To explain this effect, the structure of the excited states
in the energy region up to 6.5 MeV has been calculated within the Quasiparticle
Phonon Model. Many states are found connected to the ground and isomeric states
by $E1$, $E2$ and $M1$ transitions. The single-particle component of the wave
function is responsible for the large values of the transitions. The calculated
value of the isomeric ratio is in very good agreement with the experimental
data for all isotones. A slightly different value of maximum energy with which
the nuclei rest after neutron decay of the GDR is responsible for the reported
effect of the A-dependence of the IR.

10-dimensional space including three projections of velocity vector and three

the uniform rotation of reference frame as well as its accelerated motion.
Transformations for coordinates and angular velocities are derived. Definitions
of dynamic quantities contain a fundamental constant $\Omega$ with
dimensionality of angular velocity and the maximal acceleration in addition to
the velocity of light. The special relativity relation between energy, impulse,
and mass gets changed for particles with moment of inertia. A wave equation
obtained describes the rotary and accelerated motions of light wave. A relation
between particle moment and the Planck constant representing Bohr's postulate
is added to de Broglie's relations. A generalized space-time which allows to
consider kinematics for derivations of arbitrary order is studied. Differential
relations between velocity of arbitrary order and turn angles in the
generalized space-time are obtained.

thermal beams of atoms and molecules, launching cold atoms from a trap into a

the W-congruences, which provide the Darboux-Backlund type transformation of
