in a closed space with limited amount of indispensable resources, their
breading may start initially under suitable conditions, and after peaking, the
population should go extinct as the resources are exhausted. Starting with the
logistic equation and assuming that the carrying capacity of the environment is
a function of the amount of resources, a mathematical model describing such
pattern of population change is obtained. An application of this model to
typical population records, that of deer herds by Scheffer (1951) and O'Roke

the limiting case of a cosmological constant. Low red shift constraints include
the Hubble parameter, baryon fraction, cluster abundance, age of the universe,
bulk velocity and shape of the mass power spectrum; intermediate red shift
constraints are due to type 1a supernovae, gravitational lensing, the Ly-a
forest, and the evolution of large scale structure; high red shift constraints
are based on cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropy. Mindful of
systematic errors, we adopt a conservative approach in applying these
constraints. We determine that quintessence models in which the matter density
parameter is $0.2 \ls \Omega_m \ls 0.5$ and the effective, density-averaged
equation of state is $-1 \le w \ls -0.2$, are consistent with the most
reliable, current low red shift and CMB observations at the $2\sigma$ level.
Factoring in the constraint due to type 1a SNe, the range for the equation of
state is reduced to $-1 \le w \ls -0.4$, where this range represents models
consistent with each observational constraint at the 2$\sigma$ level or better
(concordance analysis). A combined maximum likelihood analysis suggests a
smaller range, $-1 \le w \ls -0.6$. We find that the best-fit and
best-motivated quintessence models lie near $\Omega_m \approx 0.33$, $h \approx

  We propose a method for calculating the correlation function $\xi_{qq}(r,z)$
and show its amplitude and slope to depend on the shape of the initial power
spectrum and the scale R of the fluctuations in which quasars are formed. We
demonstrate that in the CDM models with the initial power spectrum slope
$n=0.7\div1$ it is possible to explain, by choosing appropriate values of R,
how the amplitudes and correlation radii of $\xi_{qq}(r,z)$ may either increase

equivalent to a standard first-passage time problem, i.e., the probability
density governing the time taken by a Gaussian random process to first exceed a
threshold. We obtain an approximation based on the assumption that successive
chords are independent. The result is a generalization of the independent
interval approximation recently used to determine the exponent of persistence
time decay in coarsening. The approximation is easily extended to more general
models based on the intersection and union sets of models generated from the
iso-surfaces of random fields. The chord distribution functions play an
important role in the characterization of random composite and porous

response of silicon to high dose ion-irradiation. We employ a realistic and
efficient model to directly simulate ion beam induced amorphization. Structural
properties of the amorphized sample are compared with experimental data and
results of other simulation studies. We find the behavior of the irradiated
material is related to the rate at which it can relax. Depending upon the
ability to deform, we observe either the generation of a high compressive
stress and subsequent expansion of the material, or generation of tensile
stress and densification. We note that statistical material properties, such as
radial distribution functions are not sufficient to differentiate between
different densities of amorphous samples. For any reasonable deformation rate,
we observe an expansion of the target upon amorphization in agreement with
experimental observations. This is in contrast to simulations of quenching
which usually result in denser structures relative to crystalline Si. We
conclude that although there is substantial agreement between experimental
measurements and most simulation results, the amorphous structures being
investigated may have fundamental differences; the difference in density can be
attributed to local defects within the amorphous network. Finally we show that
annealing simulations of our amorphized samples can lead to a reduction of high

projection in the MA gauge, the system can be separated into the photon part

respectively. We study here the monopole part (the monopole-current system),
which is responsible to the electric confinement. Owing to the absence of
electric currents, the monopole part is naturally described using the dual
gluon field $B_\mu$ without the Dirac-string singularity. Defining the dual
Wilson loop from the dual gluon $B_\mu$, we find the perimeter law of the dual

the Yukawa potential in the infrared region after the subtraction of the

different methods (various quark models and the QCD sum rules), are
surprisingly different. The present quark models are mostly based on free
spinors and their predictions depend crucially on the choice of the light quark
mass. We propose a quark model based on the Dirac equation in a central
potential, which gives a more refined description of Dirac spinors. We show
that within such a Dirac model, the value of g is stable and large: g = 0.6(1),
where we assume no quark current renormalization ((g_A)q = 1). Such a large
result is strongly constrained by requiring that the model parameters fit the
spectrum; we show that this implies a large ``effective'' light mass. It is
also supported phenomenologically by a similar situation with heavy baryons, as
well as by experience with nucleon (if one invokes additivity). We also
calculate the couplings to heavy meson excitations, and show that the
Adler-Weisberger sum rule is well saturated by a few levels (in contrast to the
case of small g). We discuss uncertainties of our approach, and rise several
questions which remain to be answered. The main mystery is the large, unusual
discrepancy with QCD sum rules for g, whereas a good agreement is found for

ignored, are taken into account, and are found to significantly affect some
$\beta$ decay rates. The calculated capture and decay rates take into
consideration the latest experimental energy levels and $ft$ value

the $fp$-shell, show considerable differences with a recently reported shell

receptors. A cooperative model is presented, in which coupling between
neighbouring receptor dimers enhances the sensitivity with which stimuli can be
detected, without diminishing the range of chemoeffector concentration over
which chemotaxis can operate. Individual receptor dimers have two stable
conformational states: one active, one inactive. Noise gives rise to a
distribution between these states, with the probability influenced by ligand
binding, and also by the conformational states of adjacent receptor dimers. The
two-state model is solved, based on an equivalence with the Ising model in a
randomly distributed magnetic field. The model has only two effective
parameters, and unifies a number of experimental findings. According to the
value of the parameter comparing coupling and noise, the signal can be
arbitrarily sensitive to changes in the fraction of receptor dimers to which
ligand is bound. The counteracting effect of a change of methylation level is
mapped to an induced field in the Ising model. By returning the activity to the
pre-stimulus level, this adapts the receptor cluster to a new ambient
concentration of chemoeffector and ensures that a sensitive response can be
maintained over a wide range of concentrations.

explanation for sensitivity and perfect adaptation in bacterial chemotactic
signalling, based on coupling among receptor dimers. In an AIM, an external
field, representing ligand binding, is randomly applied to a fraction of spins,
representing the states of the receptor dimers, and there is a delayed negative
feedback from the spin value on the local field. This model is solved in an
adiabatic approach. If the feedback is slow and weak enough, as indeed in
chemotactic signalling, the system evolves through quasi-equilibrium states and
the ``magnetization'', representing the signal, always attenuates towards zero
and is always sensitive to a subsequent stimulus.

increases the noise figure by up to a factor of $N$, as one approaches the
laser threshold. Results are contrasted with those for an absorbing medium.
