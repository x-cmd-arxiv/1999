luminosity with wind and sstellar properties. We show that an exospheric
approximation, in which all of the emission above the optical depth unity
radius escapes the wind, reproduces very well the detailed expression for
radiation transport through a spherically symmetric wind. Using this
approximation we find that the X-ray luminosity $L_x$ scales naturally with the
wind density parameter $\Mdot/\vinf$, obtaining $L_x \sim (\Mdot/\vinf)^2$ for
optically thin winds, and $L_x \sim (\Mdot/\vinf)^{1+s}$ for optically thick
winds with an X-ray filling factor that varies in radius as $f \sim r^s$. These
scalings with wind density contrast with the commonly inferred empirical
scalings of X-ray luminosity $L_x $ with bolometric luminosity $L_B$. The
empirically derived linear scaling of $L_x \sim L_B$ for thick winds can
however be reproduced, through a delicate cancellation of emission and
absorption, if one assumes modest radial fall-off in the X-ray filling factor
($s \approx -0.25$ or $s \approx -0.4$, depending on details of the secondary
scaling of wind density with luminosity). We also explore the nature of the
X-ray spectral energy distribution in the context of this model, and find that
the spectrum is divided into a soft, optically thick part and a hard, optically
thin part. Finally, we conclude that the energy-dependent emissivity must have
a high-energy cut-off, corresponding to the maximum shock energy, in order to
reproduce the general trends seen in X-ray spectral energy distributions of hot
stars.

contain a relatively normal selection of galaxies whose histories are

therefore take advantage of our ability to resolve local galaxies into
individual stars to directly, and accurately, measure star formation histories.
The star formation histories are determined from numerical models, based on
stellar evolution tracks, of colour-magnitude diagrams. The most accurate
information on star formation rates extending back to the earliest epoches can
be obtained from the structure of the main sequence. However, the oldest main
sequence turnoffs are very faint, and it is often necessary to use the
brighter, more evolved, populations to infer the star formation history at
older times. A complete star formation history can be compared with the
spectroscopic properties of galaxies seen over a large range of lookback times
in redshift surveys. There is considerable evidence that the faint blue
galaxies seen in large numbers in cosmological surveys are the progenitors of
the late-type irregular galaxies seen in copious numbers in the Local Group,
and beyond. We consider how the ``Madau-diagram'', the star formation history
of the Universe, would look if the Local Group were to be considered
representative of the Universe as a whole.

ponderomotively coupled only to ion-acoustic quasi-modes which modulate the

plasma with $\beta\not=0$, the dynamics of nonlinear Alfven wave is also
affected by the resonant particle-wave interactions. Upon relatively rapid
evolution (compared to the particle bounce time), the quasi-stationary wave
structures, identical to the so called (Alfvenic) Rotational Discontinuities,
form, the emergence and dynamics of which has not been previously understood.
Collisionless (Landau) dissipation of nonlinear Alfven waves is also a
plausible and natural mechanism of the solar wind heating. Considering a
strong, compressible, Alfvenic turbulence as an ensemble of randomly
interacting Alfvenic discontinuities and nonlinear waves, it is shown that
there exist two distinct phases of turbulence. What phase realizes depends on
whether this collisionless damping is strong enough to provide adequate energy
sink at all scales and, thus, to support a steady-state cascade of the wave
energy. In long-time asymptotics, however, the particle distribution function
is affected by the wave magnetic fields. In this regime of nonlinear Landau
damping, resonant particles are trapped in the quasi-stationary Alfvenic
discontinuities, giving rise to a formation of a plateau on the distribution
function and quenching collisionless damping. Using the virial theorem for
trapped particles, it is analytically demonstrated that their effect on the
nonlinear dynamics of such discontinuities is non-trivial and forces a
significant departure of the theory from the conventional paradigm.

long been elusive, perhaps because their true progenitors had not yet been
guessed. In this paper I propose a causal relationship between the strongly
decreasing densities of Lyman alpha (LyA) clouds at high redshift and the
formation of GCs - namely that GCs were created by the accretion of LyA clouds
onto protogalaxies. I describe a scenario which involves an inherently stable
and orderly cycling of compression and cooling in the central cores of clouds
during the extended period of dissipation in the outer regins of gas-rich proto
galaxies, culminating in a burst of efficient star formation. I demonstrate
that the comoving density of GCs is comparable to that of LyA clouds at high
redshift, that the energetic requirements for compression to core GC densities
can be met, and that the time-scale for cooling is within obvious limits
imposed by dynamical stability.
  This dissipative process requires there to be a large column of dissipated
gas about the attractor in order to form GCs. In addition, the energy
requirements for compression requires attractor masses greater than that
capable of sustaining circular velocities of ~40 km/s. If this scenario is
supported by numerical simulations, then by implication, the GCs were formed at
modest redshifts of z~1-3. This knowledge could help to break the degeneracy
between lookback time and redshift. The model is consistent with a picture of
hierarchical galaxy growth over time scales of many billions of years.

chemically homogeneous despite the prevalence of large H II regions which

with chemically-enriched winds. Galaxies with large Wolf-Rayet star content are
chemically indistinguishable from other vigorously star-forming galaxies.
Furthermore, no significant localized chemical fluctuations are present in the
vicinity of young star clusters, despite large expected chemical yields of
massive stars. An ad-hoc fine-tuning of the release, dispersal and mixing of
the massive star ejecta could give rise to the observed homogeneity, but a more
probable explanation is that fresh ejecta from massive stars reside in a
hard-to-observe hot or cold phase. In any case, the observed chemical
homogeneity indicates that heavy elements which have already mixed with the
warm interstellar medium (thus accessible to optical spectroscopy) are
homogeneously dispersed over scales exceeding 1 kpc. Mixing of fresh ejecta
with the surrounding warm ISM apparently requires longer than the lifetimes of
typical H II regions (>10^7 yrs). The lack of observed localized chemical
enrichments is consistent with a scenario whereby freshly-synthesized metals

feature surrounded by a highly polarized radio sheath, while the interaction
with the SNR manifests itself as a ring of radio/X-ray knots within the optical

variation of the nuclear continuum in spite of the long-term flux change (by a
factor 1.3) between the two observations. At both epochs, the nuclear
point-like emission was well fitted with a strongly absorbed power law with an
exponential cutoff at high energies (E_cutoff>200 keV). We also observed a
significant flux variation of the iron line between the two observations. The
flux of the line and of the continuum changed in the opposite sense. The line
is more intense at the first epoch, when the nuclear source was at the lower
intensity level. The implied delay between the continuum and line variations
strongly suggests that the cold material responsible for the iron line
production is not located very near to the primary X-ray source. There is also
evidence that the line profile changed between the two epochs, being broader
and slightly blueshifted when the source was fainter. It is possible that the
emission feature is a blend of cold and ionized iron lines produced in separate
regions surrounding the nuclear source.

with mass approximately equal to the mass contained within the horizon at that
time. Recent work studying the application of critical phenomena in
gravitational collapse to PBH formation has shown that in fact, at a fixed
time, PBHs with a range of masses are formed. When calculating the PBH initial
mass function it is usually assumed that all PBHs form at the same horizon
mass. It is not clear, however, that it is consistent to consider the spread in
the mass of PBHs formed at a single horizon mass, whilst neglecting the range
of horizon masses at which PBHs can form. We use the excursion set formalism to
compute the PBH initial mass function, allowing for PBH formation at a range of
horizon masses, for two forms of the density perturbation spectrum. First we
examine power-law spectra with $n>1$, where PBHs form on small scales. We find
that, in the limit where the number of PBHs formed is small enough to satisfy
the observational constraints on their initial abundance, the mass function
approaches that found by Niemeyer and Jedamzik under the assumption that all
PBHs form at a single horizon mass. Second, we consider a flat perturbation
spectrum with a spike at a scale corresponding to horizon mass $\sim 0.5
M_{\odot}$, and compare the resulting PBH mass function with that of the MACHOs
(MAssive Compact Halo Objects) detected by microlensing observations. The
predicted mass spectrum appears significantly wider than the steeply-falling
spectrum found observationally.

photometric monitoring of the peculiar Wolf-Rayet star WR 134 from 1989 to
1997.
  This unprecedentedly large data set allows us to confirm unambiguously the
existence of a coherent 2.25 +/- 0.05 day periodicity in the line-profile
changes of He II 4686, although the global pattern of variability is different
from one epoch to another. This period is only marginally detected in the
photometric data set. Assuming the 2.25 day periodic variability to be induced
by orbital motion of a collapsed companion, we develop a simple model aiming at
investigating (i) the effect of this strongly ionizing, accreting companion on
the Wolf-Rayet wind structure, and (ii) the expected emergent X-ray luminosity.
We argue that the predicted and observed X-ray fluxes can only be matched if
the accretion on the collapsed star is significantly inhibited. Additionally,
we performed simulations of line-profile variations caused by the orbital
revolution of a localized, strongly ionized wind cavity surrounding the X-ray
source. A reasonable fit is achieved between the observed and modeled
phase-dependent line profiles of He II 4686. However, the derived size of the
photoionized zone substantially exceeds our expectations, given the observed
low-level X-ray flux. Alternatively, we explore rotational modulation of a
persistent, largely anisotropic outflow as the origin of the observed cyclical
variability. Although qualitative, this hypothesis leads to greater consistency
with the observations.

local structural properties in such networks vary across the sample. A natural
order parameter, resulting from a statistical-mechanical approach, captures
information concerning this heterogeneity via a certain joint probability
distribution. This joint probability distribution describes the variations in
the positional and orientational localization of the particles, reflecting the
random environments experienced by them, as well as further information
characterizing the thermal motion of particles. A complete solution, valid in
the vicinity of the amorphous solidification transition, is constructed
essentially analytically for the amorphous solid order parameter, in the
context of the random network model and approach introduced by Goldbart and
Zippelius [Europhys. Lett. 27, 599 (1994)]. Knowledge of this order parameter
allows us to draw certain conclusions about the stucture and heterogeneity of

coordination of water molecules in liquid water. Packing effects (hard sphere
default model) and packing effects plus attractive forces (Lennard-Jones
default model) are ineffective in improving the prediction of hydrophobic

default models. However, a conceptually simple cluster Poisson model that
incorporates tetrahedral coordination structure in the default model is one of
the better performers for these predictions. These results provide a partial

D 7 (1999) 107-116","10.1007/s100530050354",,"quant-ph",,"  We study the quantum effects of radiation pressure in a high-finesse cavity
with a mirror coated on a mechanical resonator. We show that the optomechanical
coupling can be described by an effective susceptibility which takes into
account every acoustic modes of the resonator and their coupling to the light.
At low frequency this effective response is similar to a harmonic response with
an effective mass smaller than the total mass of the mirror. For a plano-convex
resonator the effective mass is related to the light spot size and becomes very
small for small optical waists, thus enhancing the quantum effects of
optomechanical coupling.

electron. Applying a minor but well motivated conceptional change to Feynman's
chessboard model, we obtain exact solutions of the Dirac equation. The
calculation is performed by means of a particular simple method different from
both the combinatorial approach envisaged by Feynman and its Ising model
correspondence.

items. We previously showed that no quantum algorithm could solve this problem
in fewer than log N/(2 log log N) queries, for N large. We transform the
problem into a ""translationally invariant"" problem and restrict attention to
invariant algorithms. We construct the ""greedy"" invariant algorithm and show
numerically that it outperforms the best classical algorithm for various N. We
also find invariant algorithms that succeed exactly in fewer queries than is
classically possible, and iterating one of them shows that the insertion
problem can be solved in fewer than 0.53 log N quantum queries for large N
(where log N is the classical lower bound). We don't know whether a o(log N)
algorithm exists.
