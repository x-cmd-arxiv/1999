the large-scale (quasi) linear structure and that of the small-scale nonlinear
structure in Newtonian cosmology within the Lagrangian framework. In doing so,
we first derive the standard Friedmann expansion law using the averaging
procedure over the present horizon scale. Then the large-scale (quasi) linear
flow is defined by averaging the full trajectory field over a large-scale
domain, but much smaller than the horizon scale. The rest of the full
trajectory field is supposed to describe small-scale nonlinear dynamics. We
obtain the evolution equations for the large-scale and small-scale parts of the
trajectory field. These are coupled to each other in most general situations.
  It is shown that if the shear deformation of fluid elements is ignored in the
averaged large-scale dynamics, the small-scale dynamics is described by
Newtonian dynamics in an effective Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) background
with a local scale factor. The local scale factor is defined by the sum of the
global scale factor and the expansion deformation of the averaged large-scale
displacement field. This means that the evolution of small-scale fluctuations
is influenced by the surrounding large-scale structure through the modification
of FRW scale factor. The effect might play an important role in the structure
formation scenario. Furthermore, it is argued that the so-called {\it
optimized} or {\it truncated} Lagrangian perturbation theory is a good
approximation in investigating the large-scale structure formation up to the
quasi nonlinear regime, even when the small-scale fluctuations are in the
non-linear regime.

  Letters",,"10.1086/311893",,"astro-ph",,"  We have calculated the mass accumulation efficiency during helium shell
flashes to examine whether or not a carbon-oxygen white dwarf (C+O WD) grows up
to the Chandrasekhar mass limit to ignite a Type Ia supernova explosion. It has
been frequently argued that luminous super-soft X-ray sources and symbiotic
stars are progenitors of SNe Ia. In such systems, a C+O WD accretes
hydrogen-rich matter from a companion and burns hydrogen steadily on its
surface. The WD develops a helium layer underneath the hydrogen-rich envelope
and undergoes periodic helium shell flashes. Using OPAL opacity, we have
reanalyzed a full cycle of helium shell flashes on a 1.3 M_\odot C+O WD and
confirmed that the helium envelope of the WD expands to blow a strong wind. A
part of the accumulated matter is lost by the wind.
  The mass accumulation efficiency is estimated as \eta_{He} = -0.175 (\log
\dot M + 5.35)^2 + 1.05, for -7.3 < \log \dot M < -5.9, where the mass
accretion rate \dot M is in units of M_\odot yr^{-1}. In relatively high mass
accretion rates as expected in recent SN Ia progenitor models, the mass
accumulation efficiency is large enough for C+O WDs to grow to the
Chandrasekhar mass, i.e., \eta_{He} = 0.9 for \log \dot M = -6.3, and
\eta_{He}=0.57 for \log \dot M = -7.0. The wind velocity (\sim 1000 km/s) is
much faster than the orbital velocity of the binary (< 300 km/s) and therefore,
the wind cannot be accelerated further by the companion's motion.

is used to describe the initial magnetic field configuration. It is found that
the stationary final state depends critically on a single parameter alpha
expressing the ratio of the corotating speed at the Alfven distance to the
initial flow speed along the initial monopole-like magnetic fieldlines. Several
angular velocity laws have been used for relativistic and nonrelativistic
outflows. The acceleration of the flow is most effective at the equatorial
plane and the terminal flow speed depends linearly on alpha. Significant flow
collimation is found in nonrelativistic efficient magnetic rotators
corresponding to relatively larger than 1 values of alpha while very weak
collimation occurs in inefficient magnetic rotators with values of alpha
smaller than about 1. Part of the flow around the rotation and magnetic axis is
cylindrically collimated while the remaining part obtains radial asymptotics.
The transverse radius of the jet is inversely proportional to alpha while the
density in the jet grows linearly with alpha. For alpha greater than about 5
the magnitude of the flow in the jet remains below the fast MHD wave speed
everywhere. In relativistic outflows, no collimation is found in the supersonic
region for parameters typical for radio pulsars. All above results verify the
main conclusions of general theoretical studies on the magnetic acceleration
and collimation of outflows from magnetic rotators and extend previous
numerical simulations to large stellar distances.

star reaches spin equilibrium with a relatively large value of the fastness

accretion disks around massive black holes, for primeval or solar abundances.
First we study star formation and evolution in a purely gaseous marginally
unstable disk, and we show that unstable fragments should collapse rapidly and
give rise to protostars which accrete at a high rate, acquire a mass of a few
tens of Mo, and explode as supernovae, producing strong enriched outflows.
Second we assume that the whole mass transport is ensured by the supernovae
which induce a transfer of angular momentum. For a star formation rate
proportional to the growth rate of gravitational instability, we find solutions
for the gas and stellar densities where the gas is close to gravitational
instability, between 0.1 and 10 pc M(BH) =10**6 Mo, and between 1 and 100 pc
for M(BH)=10**8 Mo or larger, whatever the abundances, but for relatively low
accretion rates. For larger accretion rates the number of stars becomes so
large that they inhibit further star formation, and/or the rate of SN is so
high that they distroy the homogeneity and the marginal stability of the disk.
We postpone the study of this case. Besides the fact that the mechanism solves
the problem of mass transport in a region of where global instabilities do not
work, there are several consequences of this model: it can explain the high
velocity metal enriched outflows implied by Broad Absorption Lines in quasars,
it can account for a pregalactic enrichment, if black holes formed early,
finally it can trigger starbursts in the central regions of galaxies. A check
of the model would be to detect a supernova exploding within a few parsecs from
the center of an AGN, an observation which can be performed in the near future.

real space positions by adopting a non-parametric model for the velocity field
that solely relies on the linear gravitational instability and linear biasing
hypotheses. Remaining systematic contributions to the measured acceleration
vector are corrected for by using PSCz mock catalogues from N-body experiments.
The resulting acceleration vector points approx. 15 degrees away from the CMB
dipole apex, with a remarkable alignment between small and large scale
contributions. A considerable fraction of the measured acceleration is
generated within 40 h-1 Mpc with a non-negligible contribution from scales
between 90 and 140 h-1 Mpc after which the acceleration amplitude seems to have
converged. The local group acceleration from PSCz appears to be consistent with
the one determined from the IRAS 1.2 Jy galaxy catalogue once the different
contributions from shot noise have been taken into account. The results are
consistent with the gravitational instability hypothesis and do not indicate
any strong deviations from the linear biasing relation on large scales. A
maximum-likelihood analysis of the comulative PSCz dipole is performed within a

If electrons dominate, a $d$ gap should develop as observed in a number of

can be related in all cases to the development of antiferromagnetic
fluctuations which produces a magnetic pseudogap, thus lowering the density of
states at the Fermi level. The observed mainly $d$ superconductive gap then can
be due to a prevalent superconductive coupling through antiferromagnetic

as high as 4000 K the structure of this system is very similar to the random
tetrahedral network found in silica at lower temperatures. The temperature
dependence of the concentration of the defects in this network shows an
Arrhenius law. From the partial structure factors we calculate the neutron
scattering function and find that it agrees very well with experimental neutron
scattering data. At low temperatures the temperature dependence of the
diffusion constants $D$ shows an Arrhenius law with activation energies which
are in very good agreement with the experimental values. With increasing
temperature we find that this dependence shows a cross-over to one which can be
described well by a power-law, D\propto (T-T_c)^gamma. The critical temperature
T_c is 3330 K and the exponent gamma is close to 2.1. Since we find a similar
cross-over in the viscosity we have evidence that the relaxation dynamics of
the system changes from a flow-like motion of the particles, as described by
the ideal version of mode-coupling theory, to a hopping like motion. We show
that such a change of the transport mechanism is also observed in the product

temperature $T_{c}=2v$ for $\mu=0$ and the critical chemical potential
$\mu_c=2\pi v/\sqrt{3}$ for T=0. When $\mu=0$, the top-quark mass near $T_c$

possible that the dissipating cosmic vortons create the observed baryon
asymmetry of the universe. We show that fermion zero modes are an automatic
consequence cosmic strings in supersymmetric theories. Since supersymmetry is
not observed in nature, we consider possible supersymmetry breaking terms. Some
of these terms result in the zero modes being destroyed. We calculate the

nucleon-nucleon (NN) interaction for the prediction of the cross section and
analyzing power for 200-MeV (p,p') reactions that populate natural parity
states in $^{16}$O, $^{28}$Si, and $^{40}$Ca. This calculation is based on a
one-boson-exchange model of the free NN force that reproduces NN observables
well. The G-matrix includes the effects of Pauli blocking, nuclear binding, and
strong relativistic mean-field potentials. The implications of adjustments to
the effective mass ansatz to improve the quality of the approximation at
momenta above the Fermi level will be discussed, along with the general quality
of agreement to a variety of (p,p') transitions.

n-deficiency or p-richness, clearly brings out the saturation tendency of the
product's maximum exoticity in a compound nuclear reaction as the compound
nucleus is made more and more exotic using radioactive projectile (RIBs). The
effect of this saturation on the production of new proton-rich species with
RIBs over a wide Z-range has been discussed.

caloric equation of state e^*(T), the relationship between the excitation
energy per nucleon e^* and temperature. In this work we compare the
experimentally deduced e^*(T) to the theoretical predictions. The
experimentally accessible temperature was extracted from evaporation spectra
from incomplete fusion reactions leading to residue nuclei. The experimental
e^*(T) dependence exhibits the characteristic S-shape at e^* = 2-3 MeV/A. Such
behavior is expected for a finite system at a phase transition. The observed
dependence agrees with predictions of the MMMC-model, which simulates the total
accessible phase-space of fragmentation.

spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe is presented. The method is
applicable when the equation of state of the material content assumes the form
P=(g -1) rho, g = constant. The solution for the expansion factor is commonly
given only for g = 0, 1 and 4/3 when the curvature index K is 1 or -1. The
proposed procedure is valid for general g and K and it allows for ease of
derivation of the solutions. This alternative method is useful pedagogically to
introduce basic cosmology.

suitability of various heart rate variability (HRV) measures for correctly
classifying electrocardiogram records of varying lengths as normal or revealing
the presence of heart failure. Scale-dependent HRV measures were found to be
substantially superior to scale-independent measures (scaling exponents) for
discriminating the two classes of data over a broad range of record lengths.
The wavelet-coefficient standard deviation at a scale near 32 heartbeat
intervals, and its spectral counterpart near 1/32 cycles per interval, provide
reliable results using record lengths just minutes long. A jittered
integrate-and-fire model built around a fractal Gaussian-noise kernel provides
a realistic, though not perfect, simulation of heartbeat sequences.
