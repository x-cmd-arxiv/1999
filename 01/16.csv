at late times, simulating gamma-ray and positron transport for various
assumptions about the magnetic field and ionization of the ejecta. These
calculated light curve shapes are compared with light curves of specific
supernovae for which there have been adequate late observations. %The selection
of models is generally not based upon the %ability to fit the late
observations, but rather because the %model has been demonstrated by other
authors to approximate the spectra %and early light curves of that specific SN.
  From these comparisons we draw two conclusions: whether a suggested model is
an acceptable approximation of a particular event, and, given that it is, the
magnetic field characteristics and degree of ionization that are most
consistent with the observed light curve shape. For the ten SNe included in
this study, five strongly suggest $^{56}$Co positron escape as would be
permitted by a weak or radially-combed magnetic field. Of the remaining five
SNe, none clearly show the upturned light curve expected for positron trapping
in a strong, tangled magnetic field. Chandrasekhar mass models can explain
normally, sub-, and super- luminous supernova light curves; sub-Chandrasekhar
mass models have difficulties with sub- (and potentially normally) luminous
SNe. An estimate of the galactic positron production rate from type Ia SNe is
compared with gamma-ray observations of Galactic 511 keV annihilation
radiation. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of correctly treating the
positron transport for calculations of spectra, or any properties, of type Ia
SNe at late epochs ($\geq$ 200 d).

simple empirical fitting formulae of the weak lensing numerical simulation
results with the generalized Dyer-Roeder prescription. The smoothness parameter
$\tilde{\alpha}$ essentially represents the amount of matter that can cause
magnification of a given source. Since matter distribution in our universe is
inhomogeneous, we can think of our universe as a mosaic of cones centered on
the observer, each with a different value of $\tilde{\alpha}$. We define the
{\it direction dependent} smoothness parameter $\tilde{\alpha}$ via the
Dyer-Roeder equation; there is a unique mapping between $\tilde{\alpha}$ and
the magnification of a source. We find that the distribution of
$\tilde{\alpha}$ at given $z$, $p(\tilde{\alpha}|z)$, is well described by a
modified Gaussian distribution. For the same matter distribution, i.e., the
same $p(\tilde{\alpha}|z)$, different values of $\Omega_m$ and
$\Omega_{\Lambda}$ can lead to very different magnification distributions.
  Our formulae can be conveniently used to calculate the weak lensing effects
for observed Type Ia supernovae at arbitrary redshifts.

together characterize the linear development of density inhomogeneity, and we

One of the modes for density perturbations decays less rapidly than the

radio emission and the host galaxy major axis to investigate the distribution
of the angle (beta) between the axes of the nuclear accretion disk and the host
galaxy disk in Seyfert galaxies. We provide a critical appraisal of the quality
of all measurements, and find that the data are limited by observational
uncertainties and biases, such as the well known deficiency of Seyfert galaxies
of high inclination. There is weak evidence that the distribution of delta for
Seyfert 2 galaxies may be different (at the 90% confidence level) from a
uniform distribution, while the Seyfert 1 delta distribution is not
significantly different from a uniform distribution or from the Seyfert 2 delta
distribution. The cause of the possible non-uniformity in the distribution of
delta for Seyfert 2 galaxies is discussed. Seyfert nuclei in late-type spiral
galaxies may favor large values of delta (at the ~96% confidence level), while
those in early-type galaxies show a more or less random distribution of delta.
This may imply that the nuclear accretion disk in non-interacting late-type
spirals tends to align with the stellar disk, while that in early-type galaxies
is more randomly oriented, perhaps as a result of accretion following a galaxy
merger.
  We point out that biases in the distribution of inclination translate to
biased estimates of beta in the context of the unified scheme. When this effect
is taken into account, the distributions of beta for all Seyferts together, and
of Seyfert 1's and 2's separately, agree with the hypothesis that the radio
jets are randomly oriented with respect to the galaxy disk. The data are
consistent with the expectations of the unified scheme, but do not demand it.

illuminated flat accretion disc orbiting a central black hole. This provides
both a reprocessed and direct component of the X-ray emission as required by
observations of individual objects and possibly a fraction of the cosmological
X-ray background. There is some observational motivation to at least consider
the role that an effectively concave disc surface might play: (1) a reprocessed
fraction $\gsim 1/2$ in some Seyferts and possibly in the X-ray background, and
(2) the commonality of a sharp iron line peak for Seyferts at 6.4KeV despite a
dependence of peak location on inclination angle for flat disc models. Here it
is shown that a concave disc may not only provide a larger total fraction of
reprocessed photons, but can also reprocess a much larger fraction of photons
in its outer regions when compared to a flat disc. This reduces the sensitivity
of the 6.4KeV peak location to the inner disc inclination angle because the
outer regions are less affected by Doppler and gravitational effects. If the
X-ray source is isotropic, the reprocessed fraction is directly determined by
the concavity. If the X-ray source is anisotropic, the location of iron line
peak can still be determined by concavity but the total reflected fraction need
not be as large as for the isotropic emitter case. The geometric calculations
herein are applicable to general accretion disc systems illuminated from the
center.

doubly charmed baryons, $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{+}$ and $\Omega_{cc}^{+}$.
Doubly charmed baryons are described as a system containing a heavy
$cc$-diquark and a light quark, similarly as in a heavy-light meson. This leads
to preasymptotic effects in semileptonic and nonleptonic decays which are
essentially proportional to the meson wave function. Interplay between
preasymptotic effects in semileptonic and/or nonleptonic decay rates leads to
very clear predictions for semileptonic branching ratios and lifetimes of
doubly charmed baryons.

the low energy, hadronic, scale we calculate them for the relativistic MIT bag

the data by leading order evolution using the OPE and perturbative QCD. We
confirm that the contribution of quarks and gluons OAM to the nucleon spin
grows with $Q^2$, and it can be relevant at the experimental scale, even if it
is negligible at the hadronic scale, irrespective of the model used. The sign
and shape of the quark OAM distribution at high $Q^2$ may depend strongly on
the relative size of the OAM and spin distributions at the hadronic scale.
Sizeable quark OAM distributions at the hadronic scale, as proposed by several
authors, can produce the dominant contribution to the nucleon spin at high
$Q^2$. As expected by general arguments, we obtain, that the large gluon OAM
contribution is almost cancelled by the gluon spin contribution.
