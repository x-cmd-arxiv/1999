underlying the transition from episodic to mimetic (or memetic) culture with
the arrival of Homo erectus, which Donald [1991] claims paved the way for the
unique features of human culture. The model draws on Kauffman's [1993] theory
of how an information-evolving system emerges through the formation of an
autocatalytic network. Though originally formulated to explain the origin of
life, this theory also provides a plausible account of how discrete episodic
memories become woven into an internal model of the world, or worldview, that
both structures, and is structured by, self-triggered streams of thought.
Social interaction plays a role in (and may be critical to) this process.
Implications for cognitive development are explored.

  The continuum dust emission is the most easily detected: in the mm domain,
the emission is stronger for the more redshifted objects.
  For the CO lines, the situation is less favorable, and the reported
detections are helped by gravitational amplification. The increase of the CMB
temperature T_{bg} with redshift helps the rotational line excitation
(especially at high z), but not its detection.
  Absorption in front of quasars is a more sensitive probe of cold gas at high
redshift, able to detect individual clouds of a few solar masses (instead of
10^{10} Mo for emission). From the diffuse components, one can measure the
cosmic black body temperature as a function of redshift. The high column

than 100 MeV from more that 50 blazars. These sources show inferred isotropic
luminosities as large as $3\times 10^{49}$ ergs s$^{-1}$. One of the most
remarkable characteristics of the EGRET observations is that the gamma-ray
luminosity often dominates the bolometric power of the blazar. A few of the
blazars are seen to exhibit variability on very short time-scales of one day or
less. The combination of high luminosities and time variations seen in the
gamma-ray data indicate that gamma-rays are an important component of the
relativistic jet thought to characterize blazars. Currently most models for
blazars involve a beaming scenario. In leptonic models, where electrons are the
primary accelerated particles, gamma-ray emission is believed to be due to
inverse Compton scattering of low energy photons, although opinions differ as
to the source of the soft photons. Hardronic models involve secondary
production or photomeson production followed by pair cascades, and predict
associated neutrino production.

result of inverse Compton scattering of soft photons from accretion discs is
discussed. The Klein-Nishina (KN) cross section is used in the calculation of
the radiation force due to inverse Compton scattering. Our result shows that
deceleration due to scattering in the KN regime is important only for jets
starting with a bulk Lorentz factor larger than 1000. When the bulk Lorentz
factor satisfies this condition, particles scattering in the Thomson regime
contribute positively to the radiation force (acceleration), but those
particles scattering in the KN regime are dominant and the overall effect is
deceleration. In the KN limit, the drag due to Compton scattering, though less
severe than in the Thomson limit, strongly constrains the bulk Lorentz factor.
Most of the power from the deceleration goes into radiation and hence the
ability of the jet to transport significant power (in particle kinetic energy)
out of the subparsec region is severely limited. The deceleration efficiency
decreases significantly if the jet contains protons and the proton to electron
number density ratio satisfies the condition $n_p/n_{e0}>2\gamma_{\rm

using interferometry. One such method for objects of sufficient brightness is
non-redundant masking (NRM), in which observations are made through a pupil
mask that contains an array of small holes. However, NRM only uses a small
fraction of the available light. Here I describe a method for Extended NRM in
which a cylindrical lens allows interferograms from many one-dimensional arrays
to be recorded side-by-side on a two-dimensional detector.
  For fainter objects, the holes in the aperture mask should be replaced by
slits. In this case, the mask can be removed entirely, with the cylindrical
lens effectively creating a continuous series of one-dimensional
interferograms. This modified form of speckle interferometry, which I call MODS
(Multiplexed One-Dimensional Speckle), is intermediate between NRM and
conventional full-aperture speckle. An existing speckle camera can easily be
converted to MODS observations by inserting a cylindrical lens. The feasibility
of both MODS and Extended NRM are demonstrated using observations with MAPPIT

star burst that occurs when the elliptical forms in the major merger plays
therefore a crucial role in producing alpha-enhancement. Only under the
assumption that the IMF is significantly flattened with respect to the Salpeter
value during the burst, a Mg/Fe overabundant population can be obtained. In
particular for the interpretation of radial gradients in metallicity and
alpha-enhancement, the mixing of global and burst populations are of great
importance. The model predicts bright field galaxies to be less alpha-enhanced

and the HIPPARCOS position. Good sources for such ground based data are the FK5

double star. We call then the object a 'delta-mu binary'. If the proper-motion
difference is insignificant and if no other information on a binary nature of

propose a quantitative test for the significance of the observed proper-motion

distance of 10 pc, the measuring accuracy of the proper-motion difference,
expressed as a velocity, is of the order of 50 m/s (basic FK5 stars) or 80 m/s
(GC stars). At 100 pc, the mean error of the two-dimensional difference is
still 0.5 km/s or 0.8 km/s. For the FK5 stars, we provide indications on the
probable period of the delta-mu binaries. If we adopt an orbital period and a
mass-luminosity relation, we can use the observed velocity difference to
estimate the separation and the magnitude difference between the two components
of the binary. The present paper concentrates mainly on the basic principles of

distribution essentially affects the evolution of Supernova remnants (SNRs). In

The well-known self-similar Sedov solutions may not be applied to modelling
such non-spherical objects. Therefore we propose a new approximate analytical
method for full hydrodynamical description of 3D point-like explosions in
non-uniform media with arbitrary density distribution. On the basis of this
method, we investigate the general properties of evolution of 2D non-spherical
adiabatic SNRs in ISM with large-scale density gradient. It is shown that the
real shape of adiabatic SNR becomes more non-spherical with age, but the
visible shape remains close to spherical even for strong real asymmetry (ratio
of maximal to minimal shock radii) and surface brightness contrast. It is shown
also that the values of the parameters of X-ray radiation from the entire SNR
(luminosity, spectral index) are close to those in the Sedov case with the same
initial data. However, the surface distribution of the X-ray emission
parameters is very sensitive to the initial density distribution around the SN
progenitor. Therefore, the X-ray maps give important information about physical
conditions inside and outside of the non-spherical SNR.

Inclusion of spatially modulated fields into a uniform field leads occurrence

a submanifold of $V\times V$ (where $V$ is a symplectic vector space) which is
Lagrangian with respect to two constant symplectic forms. As an application, we
show using this point of view how the hyperk\""ahler metric of Cecotti, Ferrara
and Girardello associated to a special K\""ahler structure fits into the
Legendre transform construction of Lindstr\""om and Ro\v cek.

invariants of a large family of lens spaces; (ii) to show that the knowledge of
the Seiberg-Witten invariants of lens spaces is topologically equivalent to the
knowledge of its Casson-Walker invariant and of its Milnor-Turaev torsion. We
also use the results in problem (i) to derive several topological results

a weak assumption that, given a Hecke eigensystem lambda which is
(p,P)-ordinary for a fixed parabolic P in G, there exists a several variable
p-adic family underline{lambda} of Hecke eigensystems (all of them (p,P)-nearly
ordinary) which contains lambda. The assumption is that lambda is cohomological
for a regular coefficient system. If F=Q, the number of variables is three.
Moreover, in this case, we construct the three variable p-adic family
rho_{underline{lambda}} of Galois representations associated to
underline{lambda}. Finally, under geometric assumptions (which would be
satisfied if one proved that the Galois representations in the family come from
Grothendieck motives), we show that rho_{underline{lambda}} is nearly ordinary
for the dual parabolic of P. This text is an updated version of our first

model made by Klaus Geiger. Next, we argue that photons may provide
confirmation of several of these ideas. Thus we know that, copious internetted
partonic cascades may develop in the wake of relativistic collisions of nuclei
at CERN SPS and BNL RHIC energies, We use the parton cascade model to estimate
the emission of single photons generated from such cascades due to the
branching of quarks $q \to q \gamma$, scattering of quarks and gluons, and
annihilation of quarks. The formation of a hot and dense partonic matter is
shown to be preceded by an intense radiation of photons from the QED branching
of quarks. This is similar to the QCD branching $q \to qg$ which along with the
gluon multiplication ($g \to gg$) which is known to play a crucial role in the
formation of the dense partonic plasma.

motion. The algorithm is derived within a leapfrog framework and the quantities
involved into the integration are mid-step angular momenta and on-step
orientational positions. Contrary to the standard implicit method by Fincham
[Mol. Simul., 8, 165 (1992)], the revised angular momentum approach presented
corresponds completely to the leapfrog idea on interpolation of dynamical
variables without using any extrapolations. The proposed scheme intrinsically
preserves rigid molecular structures and considerably improves stability
properties and energy conservation. As is demonstrated on the basis of
simulations for water, it allows to reproduce correct results with extra large
step sizes of order 5 fs and 10 fs in the cases of energy- and
temperature-conserving dynamics, respectively. We show also that iterative
solutions can be avoided within our implicit scheme shifting from quaternions
to the entire rotation-matrix representation.
