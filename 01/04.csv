unusually active compact group HCG 16, observed using the Palomar 5m telescope.
The high signal to noise ratios (S/N $\sim 70$) of the spectra allow us to
study the variation of the emission line characteristics and the stellar
populations in the nucleus and the circumnuclear regions of the galaxies. The
emission line characteristics of these galaxies are complex, varying between
Seyfert 2 and LINERs or between LINERs and starbursts. All of the galaxies show
traces of intermediate age stellar populations, supporting our previous result
that post-starburst galaxies are common in compact groups. The galaxies
HCG16--4 and HCG16--5 show double nuclei and therefore could be two cases of
recent merger. Our observations support a scenario where HCG 16 was formed by
the successive merger of metal poor, low mass galaxies. The galaxies HCG16--1
and HCG16--2, which are more evolved, form the old core of the group. Galaxies
HCG16--4 and HCG16--5 are two more recent additions still in a merging phase.
Galaxy HCG16--5 is a starburst galaxy which is just beginning to fall into the
core. If HCG 16 is representative of compact groups in their early stage, the
whole set of observations implies that the formation of compact groups is the
result of hierarchical galaxy formation. HCG 16 could be one example of this
process operating in the local universe.

  Annapolis, Maryland, USA. ASP Conference Series 1999. eds: K.Mukai,
  C.Hellier. 9 pages, 1 figure",,,,"astro-ph",,"  In AE Aqr, magnetic fields transfer energy and angular momentum from a
rapidly spinning white dwarf to material in the gas stream from the companion
star, with the effect of spinning down the white dwarf while flinging the gas
stream material out of the binary system. This magnetic propeller produces a
host of observable signatures, chief among which are broad single-peaked
flaring emission lines with phase-shifted orbital kinematics. SW Sex stars have
accretion disks, but also broad single-peaked phase-shifted emission lines
similar to those seen in AE Aqr. We propose that a magnetic propeller similar
to that which operates in AE Aqr is also at work in SW Sex stars -- and to some
extent in all nova-like systems. The propeller is anchored in the inner
accretion disk, rather than or in addition to the white dwarf. Energy and
angular momentum are thereby extracted from the inner disk and transferred to
gas stream material flowing above the disk, which is consequently pitched out
of the system. This provides a non-local dissipationless angular momentum
extraction mechanism, which should result in cool inner disks with temperature
profiles flatter than $T\propto R^{-3/4}$, as observed in eclipse mapping
studies of nova-like variables. The disk-anchored magnetic propeller model
appears to explain qualitatively most if not all of the peculiar features of
the SW Sex syndrome.

follow-up optical spectroscopy of NGC 5905 does not reveal any signs of Seyfert
activity. At present, this makes NGC 5905 the only non-active galaxy among the
X-ray outbursting ones. We discuss several scenarios to account for the
exceptional properties of NGC 5905, including a supernova in dense medium, an
accretion-disk instability, an event of extreme gravitational lensing, and the
X-ray afterglow of a GRB to account for the X-ray outburst. We find that the
most likely model to explain the observations seems to be tidal disruption of a
star by a central SMBH, a scenario proposed by Rees (1988) as a tracer of SMBHs
in nearby non-active galaxies. The X-ray outburst in this HII galaxy then lends
further support to the scenario that all galaxies passed through an active
phase, leaving dormant SMBHs in their centers.

infall during star formation in a rotating, stellar cluster. We find that
massive nuclear SBs with core disk masses M_d \sim 10^8 - 10^9 M_{\odot}, and
supernova rates \nu_{SN} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-3} - 2 yr^{-1} (which are
consistent with the \nu_{SN} values inferred from the observed non-thermal
radio power in source candidates) may inject kinetic energies which are high
enough to blow out directed flows from the accreting disk surface, within the
SB lifetimes. In our models, the acceleration and collimation of the nuclear
outflow are provided by magnetic fields anchored into the rotating SB-disk. The
emerging outflow carries a kinetic power that is only a small fraction (a few
percent) of the supernovae energy rate produced in the SB. Based on conditions
determined from observed outflows and disks, we find that moderate disk
magnetic fields (\gtrsim 8 \times 10^{-4} G) are able to accelerate the
outflows up to the observed terminal velocities (\lesssim few 100 km s^{-1} in
the case of the Seyfert galaxies, and \sim 400 - 950 km s^{-1} in the case of
the LIGs). The outflow is produced within a wind zone in the disk of radius
\lesssim 100 pc in the LIGs, and \lesssim 10 pc in the Seyferts, with wind mass
loss to disk accretion rate ratios \dot M_w /\dot M_d \gtrsim 0.1 (where \dot

constrain cosmological models. Our analysis is based on the Press-Schechter
approach, whose reliability is tested against N-body simulations. Following a
phenomenological approach, no assumption is made a priori on the relation
between cluster masses and observed X-ray luminosities. As a first step, we use
the local XLF from RDCS, along with the high-luminosity extension provided by
the XLF from the BCS, in order to constrain the amplitude of the power
spectrum, \sigma_8, and the shape of the local luminosity-temperature relation.
We obtain \sigma_8=0.58 +/- 0.06 for Omega_0=1 for open models at 90%

\Omega_0 and the evolution of the L-T relation are constrained by the RDCS XLF

By modelling the evolution for the amplitude of the L-T relation as (1+z)^A, an
\Omega_0=1 model can be accommodated for the evolution of the XLF with 1<A<3 at
90% confidence level, while \Omega_0=0.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2} and \Omega_0<0.6 are

to support certain types of infinitesimal load (which we call ""incompatible""
loads) without plastic rearrangement. We argue that a fragile description may
be appropriate when the mechanical integrity of the medium arises adaptively,
in response to a load, through an internal jamming process. We hypothesize that
a network of force chains (or ""granular skeleton"") evolves until it can just
support the applied load, at which point it comes to rest; it then remains
intact so long as no incompatible load is applied. Our fragile models exhibits
unusual mechanical responses involving hyperbolic equations for stress
propagation along fixed characteristics through the material. These
characteristics represent force chains; their arrangement expressly depends on
the construction history. Thus, for example, we predict a large difference in
the stress pattern beneath two conical piles of sand, one poured from a point
source and one created by sieving.

solvable model for local phase pinning by impurities is defined and studied. We
find that average CDW energy and average pinning force show critical behaviour
with respect to the pinning parameter $h$. Specifically the pinning force
exhibits a threshold at $h=1$ with exponent $\beta=2$. Our model examplifies a
general concept of local impurity pinning in which the force exerted by the
impurity on the periodic CDW structure becomes multivalued and metastable
states appear beyond a threshold. It is found that local impurity pinning
becomes less effective at low temperatures and may eventually cease completely.
These results are independent of spatial dimensionality as expected for local
impurity pinning. Comparison with Larkin's model is also made.

some relevant supergravity modes are different. We show that this is indeed
true, due to a subtle cancellation. With time-dependent gauge fields on the

propagation in the bulk. We argue that this is reflected in higher derivative
