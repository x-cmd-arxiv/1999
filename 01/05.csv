primary reason for lack of research into the evolutionary causes of social
complexity has been the lack of descriptive units with which we can examine
phenotypic variation and heritability of social organization above the level of
the organism. The goal of our paper, therefore, is to begin constructing
descriptive units which map to meaningful models of multi-level selection. In
order to demonstrate how these units are useful in a real dataset, we examine
the functional changes involved in the United States economy over the last 100
years, a period of time characterized, we believe, by significant changes in
the number and kinds of social aggregates functioning as ""individuals"" with
respect to selection. Our preliminary analysis suggests that it is possible to
measure changes in the scale at which functional integration occurs through
published data, and that the multilevel selection model for complex society may
possess considerable power for describing how selection of culturally
transmitted variation occurs in complex societies.

with previous LTE studies. We find previous studies underestimate both the
systematic errors and the observational scatter in the determination of white
dwarf parameters obtained via fits to model atmospheres.
  The structure of very hot or low mass white dwarfs depends sensitively on
their history. To compute white dwarf masses, we thus use theoretical
mass-radius relations that take into account the complete evolution from the
main sequence. We find a peak mass of our white dwarf sample of 0.59 solar
masses, in agreement with the results of previous analyses. However, we do not
confirm a trend of peak mass with temperature reported in two previous
analyses.
  Analogous to other EUV selected samples, we note a lack of low mass white
dwarfs, and a large fraction of massive white dwarfs. Only one is likely to
have a helium core. While the lack of helium white dwarfs in our sample can be
easily understood from their high cooling rate and therefore low detection
probability in our temperature range, this is not enough to explain the large
fraction of massive white dwarfs. This feature very likely results from a
decreased relative sample volume for low mass white dwarfs caused by
interstellar absorption in EUV selected samples.

Be objects. A change in linear polarization across Halpha is detected in a
large fraction of the objects. Halpha in the spectra of HD 37806 and HD 50138
each consist of a double-peaked polarized line and a superposed unpolarized
single emission peak, suggesting two distinct line-forming regions. Multiple
observations of HD 45677 allow for the separation of electron and dust
scattering effects for the first time: the data indicate that the
dust-scattering region is clumpy. Two unexpected results are the non-detections
of Halpha polarization changes in omega Ori, where depolarization has
previously been detected, and in MWC 297, which exhibits source elongation at
radio wavelengths. In omega Ori time variability is probably responsible such
that this star's electron-scattering disk was much weakened at the time of
observation. Two hypotheses are advanced that might explain the MWC 297 result.
The general findings are that roughly half of the observed Herbig Be stars show
polarization changes across Halpha, implying immediately that their ionized
envelopes are not spherically symmetric. This pattern, if confirmed by
observations of a larger sample, could indicate that the non-detection rate is
simply a consequence of sampling randomly-oriented circumstellar disks able to
scatter starlight within a few stellar radii. The stars classified as B[e]

each case are different, but the widely accepted concept of dense Halpha
emitting equatorial disks around these objects is supported.

number of faint undetected companions is derived, before we evaluate the binary
frequency in this cluster. In the orbital period range log P=5.0-7.9 days, the
binary fraction in IC 348 is 19+/-5 %.This is similar to the values

  Substellar companions are found to be rare, or even missing, as companions of
low-mass stars in the separation range we surveyed. Also, the mass ratio

within the age spread of the cluster of about 10 Myr. We conclude that there is
no temporal evolution of the binary fraction between a few Myrs after the
formation process, the zero-age main sequence and the field population. We find
instead a trend for the binary fraction to be inversely correlated with stellar
density, with only loose associations exhibiting an excess of binaries. Either
all star-forming regions initially host a large number of binaries, which is
subsequently reduced only in dense clusters on a timescale of less than 1 Myr
due to numerous gravitational encounters, or specific initial conditions in the
parental molecular clouds impact on the fragmentation process leading to

constant in the central ~1 R_e. Stars in the resulting gravitational potential
move mainly on regular orbits. We use an approximate third integral K from
perturbation theory, and write the DF as a sum of basis functions in the three
integrals E, L_z and K. We then fit the projected moments of these basis
functions to the kinematic observables and deprojected density, using a
non-parametric algorithm.
  The deduced dynamical structure is radially anisotropic, with
sigma_theta/sigma_r ~ sigma_phi/sigma_r ~ 0.7 on the major axis. Both on the
minor axis and near the centre the velocity distribution is more isotropic;
thus the model is flattened by equatorial radial orbits. The kinematic data is
fit without need for a central black hole; the central mass determined
previously from ground-based data therefore overestimates the actual black hole
mass. The mass-to-light ratio of the stars is M/L_V = 6 h_50.

The median total extinction of the bluest images is E(B-V)=0.08 mag, although
the total extinction distribution is dominated by the uncertainties in the
intrinsic colors of quasars. The directly measured extinction distributions are
consistent with the mean extinction estimated by comparing the statistics of
quasar and radio lens surveys, thereby confirming the need for extinction
corrections when using the statistics of lensed quasars to estimate the
cosmological model. A disjoint subsample of two face-on, radio-selected spiral
lenses shows both high differential and total extinctions, but standard
dust-to-gas ratios combined with the observed molecular gas column densities
overpredict the amount of extinction by factors of 2-5. For several systems we

in the tilt, which induce corresponding ripples in the smectic layers. The
modulation persists up to an upper critical electric field and then disappears.
Furthermore, even in the uniform state, the system shows chiral fluctuations,
including both incipient chiral stripes and localized chiral vortices. We
compare these predictions with observed chiral modulations and fluctuations in
smectic-A liquid crystals.

Monday of October 1987. The present example provides further arguments in
favour of a discrete scale-invariance governing the dynamics of the stock

consistent with its onset extends over the period of a few months. Furthermore,
on smaller time-scales the data seems to indicate the appearance of analogous
log-periodic oscillations as precursors of the smaller, intermediate decreases.

known that these satisfy quantum ergodicity: For almost all eigenstates, the
expectation values of quantum observables converge to the classical phase-space
average with respect to Liouville measure of the corresponding classical
observable. The possible existence of any exceptional subsequences of
eigenstates is an important issue, which until now was unresolved in any
example. The absence of exceptional subsequences is referred to as quantum
unique ergodicity (QUE). We present the first examples of maps which satisfy
QUE: Irrational skew translations of the two-torus, the parabolic analogues of
Arnold's cat maps. These maps are classically uniquely ergodic and not mixing.
A crucial step is to find a quantization recipe which respects the
quantum-classical correspondence principle. In addition to proving QUE for
these maps, we also give results on the rate of convergence to the phase-space
average. We give upper bounds which we show are optimal. We construct special
examples of these maps for which the rate of convergence is arbitrarily slow.
