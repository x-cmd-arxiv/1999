a direct test of Tully-Fisher distance estimates to thirteen spiral galaxies

too short with respect to the Cepheid distances by 0.46+-0.11mag and too short
with respect to the SNIa distances by 0.49+-0.18mag. Combining the HST Cepheid
and the best SNIa data suggests that, overall, previous Tully-Fisher distances
at v~1000 kms-1 were too short by 0.43+-0.09mag, a result which is significant
at the 4.6 sigma level. These data therefore indicate that previous
Tully-Fisher distances should be revised upwards by 22+-5% implying, for
example, a Virgo distance of 19.0+-1.8Mpc. The value of Ho from Tully-Fisher
estimates is correspondingly revised downwards from Ho=84+-10kms-1Mpc-1 to
Ho=69+-8kms-1Mpc-1. There is evidence that the Tully-Fisher relation at large

Ho<50kms-1Mpc-1 cannot be ruled out by Tully-Fisher considerations.

Historically, the most familiar one is as a source of extinction in the
optical. Absorbed optical and ultraviolet light heats the dust, whence infrared
(including near-infrared to submillimeter) emission, the particular theme of
this review. In some distant galaxies, most of the luminosity of the galaxy is
thus converted into the infrared, though in the Milky Way the situation is not
generally as extreme, except in localized regions of star formation. I briefly
review the range of physical conditions in which the dust emits in the
interstellar medium and the various sizes of dust probed. Of interest
astrophysically are observations of both the spectrum and the spatial
distribution of the emission, preferably in combination.
  In the past fifteen year probes of dust emission have advanced significantly:
through IRAS, KAO, COBE experiments, IRTS, ISO, and MSX. Satellite and
stratospheric observations of dust emission are complemented by ground-based
studies, such as imaging and polarimetry in the submillimeter with the JCMT or
imaging of reflected light from dust in the near infrared with 2MASS. Looking
ahead, the next decade promises to be equally exciting. I give an overview of
some of the distinctive features of facilities anticipated in the near term

(GRBs), the GRB is produced by internal shocks within a relativistic flow while
the afterglow is produced by external shocks with the ISM. We explore the early
afterglow emission. For short GRBs the peak of the afterglow will be delayed,
typically, by few dozens of seconds after the burst. For long GRBs the early
afterglow emission will overlap the GRB signal. We calculate the expected
spectrum and the light curves of the early afterglow in the optical, X-ray and
$\gamma $-ray bands. These characteristics provide a way to discriminate
between late internal shocks emission (part of the GRB) and the early afterglow
signal. If such a delayed emission, with the characteristics of the early
afterglow, will be detected it can be used both to prove the internal shock
scenario as producing the GRB, as well as to measure the initial Lorentz factor
of the relativistic flow. The reverse shock, at its peak, contains energy which
is comparable to that of the GRB itself, but has a much lower temperature than
that of the forward shock so it radiates at considerably lower frequencies. The
reverse shock dominates the early optical emission, and an optical flash
brighter than 15th magnitude, is expected together with the forward shock peak
at x-rays or $\gamma$-rays. If this optical flash is not observed, strong
limitations can be put on the baryonic contents of the relativistic shell
deriving the GRBs, leading to a magnetically dominated energy density.

light curve derivatives both in the case of a static lens with a transverse
velocity, and in the case of microlensing that is produced through stellar
proper motions. The distributions are closely related in form, and can be
considered equivalent after appropriate scaling of the input transverse
velocity. The comparison of the distributions in this manner provides a
consistent way to consider the relative contribution to microlensing (both
large and small fluctuations) of the two classes of motion, a problem that is
otherwise an extremely expensive computational exercise. We find that the
relative contribution of stellar proper motions to the microlensing rate is
independent of the mass function assumed for the microlenses, but is a function
of optical depth and shear. We find that stellar proper motions produce a
higher overall microlensing rate than a transverse velocity of the same
magnitude. This effect becomes more pronounced at higher optical depth. With
the introduction of shear, the relative rates of microlensing become dependent
on the direction of the transverse velocity. This may have important
consequences in the case of quadruply lensed quasars such as Q2237+0305, where
the alignment of the shear vector with the source trajectory varies between
images.

are about 400 massive halos with more than 10^4 particles within the virial
radius in each cosmological model. Our unbiased selection of all massive halos
enables to quantify how well the bulk of dark matter halos can be described by
the Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) profile which was established for equilibrium
halos. We find that about seventy percent of the halos can be fitted by the NFW
profile with a fitting residual dvi_{max} less than 30% in Omega_0=1 universes.
This percentage is higher in lower density cosmological models. The rest of the
halos exhibits larger deviations from the NFW profile for more significant
internal substructures. There is a considerable amount of variation in the
density profile even for the halos which can be fitted by the NFW profile (i.e.
dvi_{max}<0.30). The distribution of the profile parameter, the concentration
$c$, can be well described by a lognormal function with the mean value \bar c
slightly smaller (15%) than the NFW result and the dispersion \sigma_c in \ln c
about 0.25. The more virialized halos with dvi_{max}<0.15 have the mean value
\bar c in good agreement with the NFW result and a slightly smaller dispersion

emission features are visible in the early spectra superposed on the normal SN
spectrum. Within about two months these features develop narrow symmetric
P-Cygni profiles. About 100 days after the explosion the light curve suddenly
flattens, the spectral lines broaden and the Halpha flux becomes larger than
what is expected from a purely radioactive model. These events are interpreted
as signatures of the onset of the interaction between the fast moving ejecta
and a slowly moving outer shell of matter ejected before the SN explosion. At
about 300 days the narrow lines disappear and the flux drops until the SN fades
away, suggesting that the interaction phase is over and that the shell has been
swept away. Simple calculations show that the superwind episode started 9 yr
before the SN explosion and lasted 6 yr, with an average dM/dt=10^(-3)
M_solar/yr. Even at very late epochs (up to day 335) the typical forbidden
lines of [OI], CaII], [FeII] remain undetected or very weak. Spectra after day
270 show relatively strong emission lines of HeI. These lines are narrower than
other emission lines coming from the SN ejecta, but broader than those from the

excitation and ionization caused by the deposition of the gamma-rays emitted in
the decay of radioactive material mixed in the He layer.

presented. Our study focusses on phase transitions within a monolayer rather
than on self aggregation. We thus model the molecules as stiff chains of
Lennard-Jones spheres with one slightly larger repulsive end bead (head)
grafted to a planar surface. Depending on the size of the head, the temperature
and the pressure, we find a variety of phases, which differ in tilt order
(including tilt direction), and in positional order. In particular, we observe
a modulated phase with a striped superstructure. The modulation results from
the competition between two length scales, the head size and the tail diameter.
As this mechanism is fairly general, it may conceivably also be relevant in
experimental monolayers. We argue that the superstructure would be very
difficult to detect in a scattering experiment, which perhaps accounts for the
fact that it has not been reported so far. Finally the effect of varying the
chain length on the phase diagram is discussed. Except at high pressures and
temperatures, the phase boundaries in systems with longer chains are shifted to
higher temperatures.

have been argued to form axionic boson stars with small masses
$10^{-14}M_{\odot}\sim 10^{-11}M_{\odot}$. Since they possess oscillating
electric fields in a magnetic field, they dissipate their energies in
magnetized conducting media such as white dwarfs or neutron stars. At the same
time the oscillating electric fields generate a monochromatic radiation with
energy equal to mass of the axion. We argue that the effect of the energy
dissipation can be seen in the old white dwarfs. In particular, We show that
colliding with sufficiently cooled white dwarfs, plausible candidates of MACHO,
the axionic boson stars dissipate their energies in the dwarfs and heat up the
dwarfs. Consequently the white dwarfs in the halo can emit detectable amount of
thermal radiations with the collision. On the other hand, the monochromatic
radiations can be seen only during the collision; a period of the dwarf passing
the axionic boson star. Assuming that MACHO are dark white dwarfs, we show that
there is a threshold in luminosity function of the white dwarfs below which the
number of the white dwarfs in the halo increase discontinuously. The threshold
in the luminosity function is expected to be located around
$10^{-5.5}L_{\odot}\sim 10^{-7}L_{\odot}$. Its precise value is determined by
the mass of the axionic boson stars dominant in the halo.

functions of Virasoro (superVirasoro) generators. We also present a possible
scenario for taking into account of NS fivebranes in the framework of our

simplified version of Green's ``world-sheets for world-sheets''.

Making
classical transformation of metric, dilaton coupled spinor theory is
transformed to minimal spinor theory with another metric and in case of 4d
spinor also in the background of the non-trivial vector field. This gives the
possibility to calculate 2d and 4d dilaton dependent conformal (or Weyl)
anomaly in easy way. Anomaly induced effective action for such spinors is
derived. In case of 2d, the effective action reproduces, without any extra
terms, the term added by hands in the quantum correction for RST model, which
is exactly solvable. For 4d spinor the chiral anomaly which depends explicitly
from dilaton is also found. As some application we discuss SUSY Black Holes in
dilatonic supergravity with WZ type matter and Hawking radiation in the same
theory. As another application we investigate spherically reduced Einstein
gravity with 2d dilaton coupled fermion anomaly induced effective action and
show the existence of quantum corrected Schwarszchild-de Sitter (SdS) (Nariai)
BH with multiple horizon.

of absorption leads to oscillations of the AB cross section.

electric dipole moments by a charge wire of finite radius which is placed in an
uniform magnetic field. The physical realistic and practically important case
that all atoms which collide with the wire are totally absorbed at its surface,
is studied in detail. The dominating terms of the scattering amplitude are
evaluated analytically for different physical constellations. The rest terms
are written in a form suitable for a numerical computation. We show that if the
magnetic field is absent, the absorbing charged wire causes oscillations of the
cross section. In the presence of the magnetic field the cross section
increases and the dominating Aharonov--Bohm peak appears in the forward
direction, suppressing the oscillations.
