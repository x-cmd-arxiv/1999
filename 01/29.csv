be responsable for Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) and be a component of
Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the universe. These particles are likely to cluster
in the galactic halo, so that the main part of UHECR are gamma rays produced in
the decay of neutral pions. Charged pions are also produced in the same process
and result in high energy electrons. We consider here the production of gamma
rays by synchrotron emission of these electrons in the galactic magnetic field.
The gamma ray fluxes are in the region of interest for some current and
proposed experiments (e.g. EGRET, GLAST, MILAGRO) in the energy range
$0.1-10^4$ GeV. A comparison with the existing upper limits at $10^5-10^8$ GeV
is also carried out. The detection of this flux of gamma rays would be an
important signature of SH relic particles as sources of UHECR and would give a
clue to the physics of the Early Universe.

in a region containing a large number of stellar sources is investigated as a
possible prescription for star formation feedback in larger scale galaxy
evolution simulations, and in connection with observed scaling relations for
molecular clouds, extragalactic giant H II regions, and starburst galaxies. The
kinetic energy increase is not simply proportional to the source input rate,
but depends on the competition between stellar power input and dissipation due
to interactions between structures formed and driven by the star formation. A
simple one-zone model is used to show that, in a steady-state, the energy
increase should be proportional to the two-thirds power of the stellar energy
injection rate, with additional factors depending on the mean density of the
region and mean column density of fragments. The scaling relation is tested
using two-dimensional pressureless hydrodynamic simulations of wind-driven star
formation, in which star formation occurs according to a threshold condition on
the column density through a shell, and a large number of shells are present at
any one time. The morphology of the simulations resembles an irregular network
or web of dynamically-interacting filaments. A set of 16 simulations in which
different parameters were varied agree remarkably with the simple analytical
prescription for the scaling relation. Converting from wind power of massive
stars to Lyman continuum luminosity shows that the cluster wind model for giant
H II regions may still be viable.

structure of the universe based on the Zel'dovich theory of gravitational
instability is proposed. It is found that the evolution of DM structure shows
features of self-similarity and the main structure characteristics can be
expressed through the parameters of initial power spectrum and cosmological
model. For the CDM-like power spectrum and suitable parameters of the
cosmological model the effective matter compression reaches the observed scales
$R_{wall}\sim $20 -- 25$h^{-1}$Mpc with the typical mean separation of
wall-like elements $D_{SLSS}\sim $50 -- 70$h^{-1}$Mpc. This description can be
directly applied to the deep pencil beam galactic surveys and absorption
spectra of quasars. For larger 3D catalogs and simulations it can be applied to
results obtained with the core-sampling analysis.
  It is shown that the interaction of large and small scale perturbations
modulates the creation rate of early Zel'dovich pancakes and generates bias on
the SLSS scale. For suitable parameters of the cosmological model and reheating
process this bias can essentially improve the characteristics of simulated
structure of the universe.
  The models with $0.3\leq \Omega_m \leq 0.5$ give the best description of the
observed structure parameters. The influence of low mass ""warm"" dark matter
particles, such as a massive neutrino, will extend the acceptable range of
$\Omega_m$ and $h$.

results regarding the slope of the temperature profile of the hot X-ray gas
within clusters, mainly because of the large, energy-dependent point spread
function (PSF) of the ASCA mirrors. We present a summary of all ASCA-determined
cluster temperature profiles found in the literature, and find a discrepancy in
the radial temperature trend of clusters based on which PSF-correction routine
is used. This uncertainty in the cluster temperature profile in turn can lead
to large uncertainties in the amount of dark matter in clusters. In this study,
we have used ROSAT PSPC data to obtain independent relative temperature
profiles for 26 clusters, most of which have had their temperature profiles
determined by ASCA. Our aim is not to measure the actual temperature values of
the clusters, but to use X-ray color profiles to search for a hardening or
softening of the spectra with radius for comparison to ASCA-derived profiles.
The radial color profiles indicate that outside of the cooling flow region, the
temperature profiles of clusters are in general constant. Within 35% of the
virial radius, we find a temperature drop of 20% at 10 keV and 12% at 5 keV can
be ruled out at the 99% confidence level. A subsample of non-cooling flow
clusters shows that the condition of isothermality applies at very small radii
too, although cooling gas complicates this determination in the cooling flow
subsample. The colors predicted from the temperature profiles of a series of
hydrodynamical cluster simulations match the data very well, although they
cannot be used to discriminate among different cosmologies. An additional
result is that the color profiles show evidence for a central peak in
metallicity in low temperature clusters.

of the dark matter. Large clusters will distort the observed shapes of
background galaxies through gravitational lensing allowing the measurement of
the cluster mass distributions. For most cases, the agreement between weak
lensing and radial velocity mass measurements of clusters is reasonably good.
There is, however, one significant exception, the z=0.32 cluster MS1224.7+2007,
which has a lensing mass substantially larger than the virial mass and also a
very high mass-to-light ratio. Since this controversial object might be an
unusually dark mass a follow-up study is definitely warranted. In this paper we
study the mass and light distributions of MS1224+2007 out to a projected radius
of 800/h kpc by measuring the gravitationally-induced distortions of background
galaxies. We detect a shear signal in the background galaxies in the radial
range 27.5 arcsec < r < 275 arcsec at the 5.5 sigma level. The resultant mass
map exhibits a peak centered on the dominant cluster galaxy and strong evidence
for substructure which is even more strongly seen in the galaxy distribution.
Assuming all the detected shear is due to mass at z=0.32 we find cluster
mass-to-light ratio of M/L_R = 640 +/- 150. The mass profile is quite flat
compared to other clusters, disagreeing with a pseudo-singular isothermal
sphere at the 95% confidence level. Our mass and M/L estimates are consistent
with the previous weak lensing result. The discrepancy between the lensing and
virial mass remains although it might be partially explained by subclustering
and infall perpendicular to the line-of-site. This cluster remains a candidate
dark object deficient in baryons and as such severely tests cosmological
models.

of a microlensing event can be used in an unbiased estimator of the optical

estimated from pixel microlensing data. We derive analytic expressions for the
observed rate of pixel lensing events as a function of the full width at half
maximum timescale. This contrasts work in the literature which express rates in
terms of an ``event duration'' or Einstein time, which require knowledge of the
magnification, which is difficult to determine in a pixel event. The full width
at half maximum is the most directly measured timescale. We apply these results
to possible pixel lensing surveys, using HST for M87, and CFHT for M31. We
predict M87 microlensing rates for the HST Advanced Camera and for NGST, and
demonstrate that one will be able to probe the stellar IMF. Next, we describe a
new method by which a crude measurement of the magnification can be made in the
regime of magnifications A~10-100. This in turn gives a crude measurement of
the Einstein time. This program requires good photometry and sampling in the
low magnification tails of an event, but is feasible with today's technology.

more than twice the normal rate of ""peculiar"" morphologies, both of which are
attributable to relatively recent disturbances. The galaxies with active nuclei
(AGNs: Seyferts and LINERs) have the same incidence of bars as normal spirals,
but show rings significantly more often than normal galaxies or starbursts. The
LINERs have elevated rates of inner rings, while the Seyferts have outer ring
fractions several times those in normal galaxies. The different formation times
of bars and rings suggest an interpretation of these differences. Bars form
relatively quickly, and indicate that material is recently being transported
(by redistribution of angular momentum) to the center of the galaxy, where it
is likely to trigger a short (e.g., $\lesssim 10^8$ yrs) burst of star
formation. Outer rings may result from similar disturbances, but require much
more time to form, while inner rings form in a shorter time, more comparable to
bars. Thus it may be that after an interaction or instability triggers an
infall of gas, the galaxy in the earliest stage is likely to show enhanced star
formation in its center, while later it is more likely to show LINER activity,
and still later likely to be a Seyfert.

ground-based, and Hubble Space Telescope/Faint Object Camera long-slit
spectroscopy at sub-arcsec spatial resolution, of the narrow-line region of NGC
4151. In agreement with previous work, the extended emission gas (R > 4"") is
found to be in normal rotation in the galactic plane, a behaviour that we were
able to trace even across the nuclear region, where the gas is strongly
disturbed by the interaction with the radio jet, and connects smoothly with the
large scale rotation defined by the neutral gas emission. The HST data, at
0.029"" spatial resolution, allow us for the first time to truly isolate the
kinematic behaviour of the individual clouds in the inner narrow-line region.
We find that, underlying the perturbations introduced by the radio ejecta, the
general velocity field can still be well represented by planar rotation down to
a radius of ~ 0.5"" (30 pc), distance at which the rotation curve has its
turnover.
  The most striking result that emerges from our analysis is that the galaxy
potential derived fitting the rotation curve changes from a ""dark halo"" at the
ENLR distances to dominated by the central mass concentration in the NLR, with
an almost Keplerian fall-off in the 1""< R < 4"" interval. The observed velocity
of the gas at 0.5"" implies a mass of M ~ 10E9 M(sol) within the inner 60 pc.
The presence of a turnover in the rotation curve indicates that this central
mass concentration is extended. The first measured velocity point (outside the
region saturated by the nucleus) would imply an enclosed mass of ~ 5E7 M(sol)
within R ~ 0.15"" (10 pc) which represents an upper limit to any nuclear point
mass.

formation of a fracture inside the sheared pack. The model is based on the
existence of a persistence length for the fractures, which imposes a
self-similar structure on the clusters. Through a probabilistic approach, we
can evaluate the rate of appearance of a cluster of a given size and obtain a
prediction for the average velocity profiles. We also predict the existence of
large stress fluctuations at the moving wall, which characteristics are in good

concentration profile of dopants implanted in group-IV alloy, and III-V zinc
blende structure materials. Our program incorporates methods for reducing
computational overhead, plus a rare event algorithm to give statistical
accuracy over several orders of magnitude change in the dopant concentration.
  The code uses a molecular dynamics (MD) model, instead of the binary
collision approximation (BCA) used in implant simulators such as TRIM and
Marlowe, to describe ion-target interactions. Atomic interactions are described
by a combination of `many-body' and screened Coulomb potentials. Inelastic
energy loss is accounted for using a Firsov model, and electronic stopping is
described by a Brandt-Kitagawa model which contains the single adjustable
parameter for the entire scheme. Thus, the program is easily extensible to new
ion-target combinations with the minimum of tuning, and is predictive over a
wide range of implant energies and angles.
  The scheme is especially suited for calculating profiles due to low energy,
large angle implants, and for situations where a predictive capability is
required with the minimum of experimental validation. We give examples of using
our code to calculate concentration profiles and 2D `point response' profiles
of dopants in crystalline silicon, silicon-germanium blends, and
gallium-arsenide. We can predict the experimental profile over five orders of
magnitude for <100> and <110> channeling and for non-channeling implants at
energies up to hundreds of keV.

false vacuum decay with the effect of gravity has been an unsolved problem.
Several years ago, we proposed a conjecture which is to be proved in order to
give a consistent solution to the negative mode problem. We called it the
``no-negative mode conjecture''. In the present paper, we give a proof of this
conjecture for rather general models. Recently, we also proposed the
``no-supercritical supercurvature mode conjecture'' that claims the absence of
supercritical supercurvature modes in the one-bubble open inflation model. In
the same paper, we clarified the equivalence between the ``no-negative mode
conjecture'' and the ``no-supercritical supercurvature mode conjecture''.
Hence, the latter is also proved at the same time when the former is proved.

the best understood: for the late stages of such a perturbation, the waveform

gravitational wave antenna data for these should be relatively easy. In this
paper, I present the results of a single-filter search for ringdown waveforms
arising from a 50 solar mass black hole with 98% of its maximum spin angular
momentum using data from the Caltech 40-meter prototype interferometer. This
search illustrates the techniques that may be used in analyzing data from
future kilometer-scale interferometers and describes some of the difficulties
present in the analysis of interferometer data. Most importantly, it
illustrates the use of coincident events in the output of two independent
interferometers (here simulated by 40-meter data at two different times) to
substantially reduce the spurious event rate. Such coincidences will be
essential tools in future gravitational wave searches in kilometer-scale
interferometers.

stable picture of the heterotic string is mapped at the triple points of the

beta electron, a helium nucleus, and an antineutrino. For finite collapse
times, the post-collapse beta electron energy can originate from a range of
pre-collapse energies due to the uncertainty principle. Long collapse times
give negligible uncertainty, so the pre-collapse spectrum must approach that of
isolated nuclei. We calculate the post-collapse electron spectrum which shows a
collapse-dependent pileup near the endpoint. Comparison with observation shows
that a collapse time of 1 x 10^-17 s explains the observed pileup. The collapse
of the entangled quantum system must be triggered by the environment: most
likely an atomic (molecular) electron initially bound to the atomic (molecular)
tritium source or perhaps ambient gas molecules. Coincidentally, the 40 eV
tritium atom-helium ion energy level shift is unobservably small for times
shorter than the system collapse time. We conclude that an atomic (molecular)
electron triggers the collapse once the 40 eV shift becomes detectible and the
electron detects the helium nucleus. Thus collapse may explain the tritium

the one known in shock wave dynamics for gas. Then using solvability condition,
we extract a time-dependent scenario for the evolution of the amplitude of the

gives rise to a vortex nucleation. We also give a first order correction at the
Landau velocity of nucleation, taking into account the geometry of the flow.

the spirit of the Brandt-Kitagawa effective charge theory, we develop a model
for electronic stopping power for an ion, which can be factorized into (i) a
globally averaged effective charge taking into account effects of close and
distant collisions by target electrons with the ion, and (ii) a local charge
density dependent electronic stopping power for a proton. This phenomenological
model is implemented into both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations.
There is only one free parameter in the model, namely, the one electron radius
rs0 for unbound electrons. By fine tuning this parameter, it is shown that the
model can work successfully for both boron and arsenic implants. We report that
the results of the dopant profile simulation for both species are in excellent
agreement with the experimental profiles measured by secondary-ion mass
spectrometry(SIMS) over a wide range of energies and with different incident
directions. We point out that the model has wide applicability, for it captures
the correct physics of electronic stopping in ion implantation. This model also
provides a good physically-based damping mechanism for molecular dynamics
simulations in the electronic stopping power regime, as evidenced by the
striking agreement of dopant profiles calculated in our molecular dynamics
simulations with the SIMS data.

one-dimensional bunch of charged particles has been considered in the presence
of intense monochromatic circularly polarized electromagnetic (CPEM) pump wave.
In the zero state (in the absence of bunch) the interaction of the pump wave
with plasma is described by means of Maxwell equations and relativistic
nonlinear hydrodynamic equations of cold plasma. The excitation of linear waves
by one-dimensional bunch is considered on this background. It is shown that
there are three types of solutions of linear equations obtained for induced
waves corresponding to three ranges of parameter values of the pump wave, bunch
and plasma. In the first range of parameter values the amplitude of transverse
components of induced waves is shown to grow as the bunch energy and after some
value of the relativistic factor of the bunch to be almost independent of the
energy and increase proportional to the intensity and frequency of the pump
wave. The dependence of longitudinal component of induced waves on the
relativistic factor of the bunch is weak. Its amplitude and wavelength grow as
the intensity of pump wave. The second range of parameters is a resonance one.
The amplitude of the wave excited by the bunch is a linear function of the
distance to the bunch. In the third range of parameter values the longitudinal
component of induced fields are localized near the bunch boundaries and are
exponentially decreased with the increase in distance from these boundaries.
The amplitudes of transverse components of induced waves reach a constant value
with the distance from the bunch boundaries.
