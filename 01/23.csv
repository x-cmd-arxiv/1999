  - massive detailed data on the individual market operations became available.
  - ""microscopic simulations"" of the stock markets in terms of their individual

  Consequently, we are now able to confront real market data with the results

bursts have the correct rates of occurrence and plausibly the correct

If one assumes that they are in fact lethal to land based life throughout the
galaxy, one has a mechanism that prevents the rise of intelligence until the
mean time between bursts is comparable to the timescale for the evolution of
intelligence. Astrophysically plausible models suggest the present mean time
between bursts to be $\sim 10^8$ years, and evolutionarily plausible models
suggest the rise of intelligence takes $\sim 10^8$. Hence, this model suggests
that the Galaxy is currently undergoing a phase transition between an
equilibrium state devoid of intelligent life to a different equilibrium state
where it is full of intelligent life.

complete, is used to analyse their spectral energy distribution (SED). The SEDs
are generally well fitted with power-laws, with an average slope alpha=-0.39
(S_nu propto nu^alpha). Two quasars appear clearly differenciated, exhibiting
redder colours that the rest, and they have redshifts z=0.50 and 1.12.
Broad-band composite SEDs in the range 1300-4500 AA were obtained from the
remaining quasars and they show the CIV1549 line and a break at around 3000 A,
where the SED changes from alpha_blue=0.11+-0.16 at lambda>3000 A to
alpha_UV=-0.66+-0.15 at lambda<3000 A. The continuum shape depends on redshift.
For the quasars with z<1.2 we find alpha_blue=0.21+-0.16 and
alpha_UV=-0.87+-0.20, and for z>1.2 alpha_UV is more flat, -0.48+-0.12. A
similar trend is found between alpha_UV and luminosity at 2400 A, L_2400, with
luminous quasars exhibiting a bluer spectrum. In addition, an intrinsic
correlation is found between L_2400 and radio power at 408 MHz. The
correlations alpha_UV-z, alpha_UV-L_2400 and L_2400-z are consistent with
accretion disc models with approximately constant black hole mass and accretion
rates increasing with redshift. If the trends L_2400-z and P_408-z are

engine of blazars is converted into nonthermal particle energy in the comoving
frame through a process of sweeping up material from the surrounding medium.
The resulting deceleration of the bulk plasma introduces a number of effects
which must be included in blazar modeling. For example, the varying Doppler
factor means that model fits must employ time integrations appropriate to the
observing times of the detectors. We find that the ratio of the peak
synchrotron fluxes reached at two different photon energies is largest when
viewing along the jet axis, and becomes smaller at large angles to the jet
axis. This effect is important in studies of the statistics of jet sources.
Variability due either to bulk plasma deceleration or radiative cooling must be
distinguished in order to apply recently proposed tests for beaming from
correlated X-ray and TeV observations. The blast-wave physics developed to
analyze these problems implies that most of the energy injected in the comoving
frame is originally in the form of nonthermal hadrons. Because plasmoid
deceleration can produce rapid variability due to a changing Doppler factor,
arguments against hadronic blazar models related to the long radiative cooling
time scale of hadrons are not compelling.

that the typical apparent angular scale size for an absorbing cloud is small

brief, necessarily cursory and incomplete history. This history revolves around
four distinct aspects. There is the technological evolution that began with
early research on packet switching and the ARPANET (and related technologies),
and where current research continues to expand the horizons of the
infrastructure along several dimensions, such as scale, performance, and higher
level functionality. There is the operations and management aspect of a global

resulted in a broad community of Internauts working together to create and
evolve the technology. And there is the commercialization aspect, resulting in
an extremely effective transition of research results into a broadly deployed

non-perturbatively with full use of chiral Ward identities employing four
external quarks with an equal off-shell momentum in the Landau gauge. This
method, without invoking any effective theory, enables us to construct the weak
four-quark operators exhibiting good chiral behavior. Our results for $B_K$

$B_K(NDR, 2 GeV)=0.69(7)$ at $a^{-1}=2.7-4.3$GeV, which agrees with the value
obtained with the Kogut-Susskind quark action. For comparison we also calculate
$B_K$ with one-loop perturbative mixing coefficients. While this yields
incorrect values at finite lattice spacing, a linear extrapolation to the
continuum limit as a function of $a$ leads to a result consistent with those
obtained with the Ward identity method.

agrees with all known results and leads to interesting new constraints on low

mass scales. Previous tests of these theorems based on coefficients extracted
from scattering data indicate a pattern of gross violations which suggested
serious problems for the perturbative treatment of pions implicit in $Q$
counting. We discuss the possibility that uncertainties associated with
extracting the coefficients from the scattering data make such tests invalid.
Here we show that errors in the s-wave phase shift extractions are sufficiently
small to test direct test predictions from $Q$ counting at next to leading
order. In particular we show that there exist low energy theorems for the sum
of all terms in the effective range expansion beyond the first two which allow
for precise tests. These low energy theorems fail badly which suggests that
pionic aspects of $Q$ counting are not under control.
