bubble of a finite size is one of the most interesting realizations extensively
discussed in the literature. The original idea was based on the theory of
tunneling and bubble formation in the theories of a single scalar field.
However, for a long time we did not have any consistent models of this type, so
it was impossible to compare predictions of such models with the observational
data on the CMB anisotropy. The first semi-realistic model of this type was
proposed only very recently, in hep-ph/9807493. Here we present the results of
our investigation of the scalar and tensor perturbation spectra and the
resulting CMB anisotropy in such models. In all models which we have studied
there are no supercurvature perturbations. The spectrum of scalar CMB
anisotropies has a minimum at small l and a plateau at l > O(10) for low
Omega_0. Meanwhile tensor CMB anisotropies are peaked at l=2. Relative
magnitude of the scalar CMB spectra versus tensor CMB spectra at small l
depends on the parameters of the models.

theoretical white dwarf mass distribution into account, assuming that the
observationally derived sample is restricted to white dwarf masses above 0.90
solar, and taking into account that the gas and the source population have a
different scale height. A total number of at least 200-500 and at most
6,000-15,000 sources is deduced depending on the used galaxy N_H model, making
use of the population synthesis calculation of Yungelson (1996). The spatial
distribution favors a disk (or spiral-arm) dominated young stellar population
with a ratio of 1/(4-7) of bulge/disk systems. Assuming that all supersoft
sources with masses in excess of 0.5 solar masses are progenitors of supernovae

white dwarf must have formed before the neutron star, from what was originally
the more massive star in the binary. Due to mass transfer, the originally less
massive star could become sufficiently massive to end its life in a supernova

of spectral properties and short-term variability to that of dynamically proven
BHCs. However, while most of the other galactic BHCs are known to be
transients, these two objects could be considered persistent though variable
sources. The persistent behavior of these sources implies some constraints on
the parameters of the binary systems. Both sources were detected in the first
GRANAT observation of the GC region. They are the only two persistent BHCs seen
in the 35-75 keV SIGMA image after collecting several million seconds of

  Another peculiar object in the field is of course a putative supermassive

X-ray luminosity from Sgr A* is very small ($\la 10^{36}$ erg/s). However an
indication that Sgr A* might have been much brighter in the past was found

the $\gamma$-ray emission of FSRQs is produced by Comptonization of external

lower energies in the flare state. This is opposite to the well-known broadband
spectral behavior of high-frequency peaked BL-Lac objects where the external
radiation field is believed to be weak and synchrotron-self Compton scattering
might be the dominant $\gamma$-ray radiation mechanism. The synchrotron peak
shift, if observed in FSRQs, can thus be used as a diagnostic to determine the
dominant radiation mechanism in these objects. I suggest a few FSRQs as

a shear flow configuration in 2D compressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The
linear growth and the subsequent non-linear saturation of the instability are
studied numerically. We consider an initial magnetic field aligned with the
shear flow, and analyze the differences between cases where the initial field
is unidirectional everywhere (uniform case), and where the field changes sign
at the interface (reversed case). We recover and extend known results for pure
hydrodynamic and MHD cases with a discussion of the dependence of the
non-linear saturation on the wavenumber, the sound Mach number, and the
Alfvenic Mach number for the MHD case.
  A reversed field acts to destabilize the linear phase of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability compared to the pure hydrodynamic case, while a uniform field
suppresses its growth. In resistive MHD, reconnection events almost instantly
accelerate the buildup of a global plasma circulation. They play an important
role throughout the further non-linear evolution as well, since the initial
current sheet gets amplified by the vortex flow and can become unstable to
tearing instabilities forming magnetic islands. As a result, the saturation
behaviour and the overall evolution of the density and the magnetic field is
markedly different for the uniform versus the reversed field case.

is that the deviation of the Lyapunov exponent from the uncoupled-limit limit
is function of a single scaling parameter which, in the case of strictly
positive multipliers, is the ratio of the coupling strength with the variance
of local multipliers. Moreover, we find an approximate analytic expression for
the Lyapunov exponent by mapping the problem onto the evolution of a chain of
nonlinear Langevin equations, which are eventually reduced to a single
stochastic equation. The probability distribution of this dynamical equation
provides an excellent description for the behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent.
Furthermore, multipliers with random signs are considered as well, finding that
the Lyapunov exponent still depends on a single scaling parameter, which
however has a different expression.

similar effects as a strong gravitational field in the case of dilute-alloy
solidification. Therefore, the coupling between the Grinfeld and the

former instability gets reduced to a value close to that of the latter.
Analogously, in the case of eutectics, the characteristic length scale of the
Grinfeld instability should be reduced to a size not extremely far from typical
lamellar spacings. In a Jackson-Hunt like approach we average the undercooling,
including the stress term, over a pair of lamellae. Following Jackson and Hunt,
we assume the selected wavelength to be determined by the minimum undercooling
criterion and compute its shift due to the external stress. we realize the
shifting of the wavelength by the application of external stress. In addition,

entropy $S$ is lowered toward a black hole and then dropped in, it was shown by
Unruh and Wald that the generalized second law of black hole thermodynamics
holds, without the need to assume any bounds on $S$ other than the bound that
arises from the fact that entropy at a given energy and volume is bounded by
that of unconstrained thermal matter. The original analysis by Unruh and Wald
made the approximation that the box was ``thin'', but they later generalized
their analysis to thick boxes (in the context of a slightly different process).
Nevertheless, Bekenstein has argued that, for a certain class of thick boxes,
the buoyancy force of the ``thermal atmosphere'' of the black hole is
negligible, and that his previously postulated bound on $S/E$ is necessary for
the validity of the generalized second law. In arguing for these conclusions,
Bekenstein made some assumptions about the nature of unconstrained thermal
matter and the location of the ``floating point'' of the box. We show here that
under these assumptions, Bekenstein's bound on $S/E$ follows automatically from
the fact that $S$ is bounded by the entropy of unconstrained thermal matter.
Thus, a box of matter which violates Bekenstein's bound would violate the
assumptions made in his analysis, rather than violate the generalized second
law. Indeed, we prove here that no universal entropy bound need be hypothesized
in order to ensure the validity of the generalized second law in this process.

hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The existence of knots and links associated with
complements of these 3-manifolds is highly nontrivial and requires careful
proofs. The paper provides a concise introduction into this topic. A brief

peculiar gauge in which a wave function renormalization is absent. The
numerical evaluation shows that the wave function renormalization is fairly
close to 1 in the Landau gauge. It means that this gauge is still a specific
gauge where the Ward-Takahashi identity is satisfied approximately. We also
find that the dynamical mass is almost constant if the topological mass is
larger than the coupling constant, while it decreases when the topological mass
is comparable to or smaller than the coupling constant and tends to the value
in $QED_3$ without the Chern-Simons term.
