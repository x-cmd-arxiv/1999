explore the nature and location of the lenses. We conclude that the large
majority of lenses, whether they are luminous or dark, are likely to be
binaries. Further, we demonstrate that blending is an important feature of all
the data sets. An additional interpretation suggested by the data, that the
caustic crossing events along the directions to the Magellanic Clouds are due
to lenses located in the Clouds, implies that most of the LMC/SMC events to
date are due to lenses in the Magellanic Clouds. All of these conclusions can
be tested. If they are correct, a large fraction of lenses along the direction
to the LMC may be ordinary stellar binary systems, just as are the majority of
the lenses along the direction to the Bulge. Thus, a better understanding of
the larger-than-anticipated value derived for the Bulge optical depth may allow
us to better interpret the large value derived for the optical depth to the
LMC. Indeed, binarity and blending in the data sets may illuminate connections
among several other puzzles: the dearth of binary-source light curves, the
dearth of non-caustic-crossing perturbed binary-lens events, and the dearth of
obviously blended point-lens events.

(a) a non-thermal (nuclear) continuum source and (b) the non-thermal continuum

attenuation of these continua by gas with column density $10^{22} cm^{-2}$
located between the nucleus and the coronal line region. The calculated coronal
line ratios are in a good agreement with those observed in NGC1068 for a model
in which about 40% of the line emission comes from gas illuminated by
unattenuated, non-thermal continuum, and about 60% from gas illuminated by
attenuated, non-thermal continuum. The electron density of the coronal line
emitting gas in NGC1068 is found to be $10^4 cm^{-3}$. In the Circinus galaxy
the coronal line emission comes from gas with electron density $10^3 cm^{-3}$
illuminated entirely by attenuated, non-thermal continuum. The derived
ionization parameters for both coronal line regions are very similar, but the
different densities imply a higher ionizing photon flux in NGC1068, consistent
with the higher observed excitation state of the line emitting gas in that
galaxy. A possible geometry of the coronal line region of both galaxies is
discussed, in which the distribution of the attenuating gas may be strongly
affected by the relative strength of the nuclear radio-jet. The stronger
radio-jet in NGC1068 may have cleared a channel through the NLR allowing some
unattenuated nuclear continuum to illuminate part of the coronal line region.

for the system and identifying mechanisms responsible for its spectacular

practically all activity observed in the UV, optical and radio range, while
variable obscuration of the Mira by circumstellar dust is responsible for
long-term changes in the near-IR magnitudes. The observations show RX Pup
underwent a nova-like eruption during the last three decades. The hot component
contracted in radius at roughly constant luminosity from 1975 to 1986, and was
the source of a strong stellar wind which prevented it from accreting material
lost in the Mira wind. Around 1988/9 the hot component turned over in the HR
diagram and by 1991 its luminosity had faded by a factor of about 30 with
respect to the maximum plateau value and the hot wind had practically ceased.
By 1995 the nova remnant started to accrete material from the Mira wind, as
indicated by a general increase in intensity of the optical continuum and HI
emission. The quiescent spectrum resembles the quiescent spectra of symbiotic
recurrent novae, and its intensity indicates the hot component must accrete as
much as about 1 per cent of the Mira wind, which is more or less the amount
predicted by Bondi-Hoyle theory. The earliest observational records from the
1890s suggest that another nova-like eruption of RX Pup occurred around 1894.

nonrelativistic simulations with equal useful power or thrust. We examine these

velocity field, the width of the cocoon, the age of the jets, and the internal
structure of the jet itself. The primary result of these comparisons is that
the velocity field of nonrelativistic jet simulations cannot be scaled up to
give the spatial distribution of Lorentz factors seen in relativistic
simulations. Since the local Lorentz factor plays a major role in determining
the total intensity for parsec scale extragalactic jets, this suggests that a
nonrelativistic simulation cannot yield the proper intensity distribution for a
relativistic jet. Another general result is that each relativistic jet and its
nonrelativistic equivalents have similar ages (in dynamical time units, =
R/a_a, where R is the initial radius of a cylindrical jet and a_a is the sound
speed in the ambient medium). In addition to these comparisons, we have
completed four new relativistic simulations to investigate the effect of
varying thermal pressure on relativistic jets. The simulations generally
confirm that faster (larger Lorentz factor) and colder jets are more stable,
with smaller amplitude and longer wavelength internal variations. The apparent
stability of these jets does not follow from linear normal mode analysis, which
suggests that there are available growing Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. (Abridged.)

spectral energy distributions of the identifications are consistent with those
of high extinction starbursts such as Arp 220. The far-IR luminosities of the
sources at z > 0.5 are of order 3 x 10^12 h_50^-2 L_sun, i.e. slightly larger
than that of Arp 220. Based on this small sample, the cumulative bolometric
luminosity function shows strong evolution to z ~ 1, but weaker or possibly
even negative evolution beyond. The redshift dependence of the far-IR
luminosity density does not appear, at this early stage, to be inconsistent
with that seen in the ultraviolet luminosity density. Assuming that the energy
source in the far-IR is massive stars, the total luminous output from
star-formation in the Universe is probably dominated by the far-IR emission.
The detected systems have individual star-formation rates (exceeding 300
h_50^-2 M_O yr^-1) that are much higher than seen in the ultraviolet selected
samples, and which are sufficient to form substantial stellar populations on
dynamical timescales of 10^8 yr. The association with merger-like morphologies
and the obvious presence of dust makes it attractive to identify these systems
as forming the metal-rich spheroid population, in which case we would infer
that much of this activity has occurred relatively recently, at z ~ 2.

when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the cloud motion (Jones et al.
1996, Miniati et al. 1998). It was not clear, however, how dependent those
findings were to the assumed field configuration and cloud properties. To
expand our understanding of this effect, we examine several new cases by varing
the magnetic field orientation angle with respect to the cloud motion (\theta),
the cloud-background density contrast, and the cloud Mach number.
  We show that in 2D and with \theta large enough, the magnetic field tension
can become dominant in the dynamics of the motion of high density contrast, low
Mach number clouds. In such cases a significant fraction of cloud kinetic
energy can be transformed into magnetic energy with the magnetic pressure at
the cloud nose exceeding the ram pressure of the impinging flow. We derive a
characteristic timescale for this process of energy ``conversion''. We find
also that unless the cloud motion is highly aligned to the magnetic field,
reconnection through tearing mode instabilities in the cloud wake limit the
formation of a strong flux rope feature following the cloud. Finally we attempt
to interpret some observational properties of the magnetic field in view of our
results.

analyses of simultaneous energy spectra and power density spectra at 4 s

thick accretion disk plus power law model, while the power density spectrum
consists of a varying red noise component plus the variable frequency QPO. The
features of both spectra are strongly correlated with one another. The 1-15 Hz

themselves have an energy spectrum consistent with the power law component

emitters (Blazars). There naturally comes an appealing idea that the
acceleration of the highest energy cosmic rays in the AGNs has a signature in
the form of gamma ray emission and high energy neutrino emission through the
collisions of very high energy protons with soft photons. Moreover it is often
said that electrons cannot reach enough energy through Fermi acceleration to
account for the highest energy photons observed with ground Cerenkov
telescopes. In this paper, we discussed these points and show that the fast
variability of the flares recently observed rules out the assumption of a Fermi
acceleration of protons. We show that Fermi acceleration of electrons is enough
to account for the gamma spectra, their shape, cut-off and their variability.
Moreover the spectral break is nicely explained by invoking an gamma-ray
photosphere. Nevertheless we give estimates of the high energy cosmic ray
generation in AGNs and of the resultant neutrino flux, that turns out to be

presence of four types of intense X-ray bursts. All the observed bursts have a
slow exponential rise, a sharp linear decay, and they can broadly be put in two
classes: irregular and quasi-regular bursts in one class, and regular bursts in
another class. The regular bursts are found to have two distinct time scales
and they persist over extended durations. There is a strong correlation between
the preceding quiescent time and the burst duration for the quasi-regular and
irregular bursts. No such correlation is found for the regular bursts. The
ratio of average flux during the burst time to the average flux during the

  In particular we derive the quantitative (complete as possible up to third
order terms) and qualitative predictions for constrained averages and
constrained dispersions -- which describe the nonlinearities and the
stochasticity properties beyond the linear regime -- and compare them against
numerical simulations. We find overall a good agreement for constrained
averages; however, the agreement for constrained dispersions is only
qualitative. Scaling relations for the Omega-dependence of these quantities are
satisfactory reproduced.
  Guided by our analytical and numerical results, we finally construct a robust
phenomenological description of the joint PDF in a closed analytic form. The
good agreement of our formula with results of N-body simulations for a number
of cosmological parameters provides a sound validation of the presented
approach.
  Our results provide a basis for a potentially powerful tool with which it is
possible to analyze galaxy survey data in order to test the gravitational
instability paradigm beyond the linear regime and put useful constraints on
cosmological parameters. In particular we show how the nonlinearity in the

  Scattering Experiment?","Ph.D. thesis of J. Karakowski (G. A. Miller, adviser). 158 pages",,,"nt@uw-99-6","nucl-th",,"  A calculation of deuteron Compton scattering using non-relativistic
diagrammatic perturbation theory is presented, with the primary motivation of
investigating the feasibility of determining the neutron polarizabilities from
this type of experiment. This calculation is expected to be valid for energies
below 100 MeV. Previous theoretical and experimental estimates for the
polarizabilities are given. All diagrams are calculated by expanding the photon
wavefunctions into partial waves and using realistic deuteron wavefunctions.
The Green's function for the intermediate state in the dispersive states is
determined numerically. Pion-exchange, relativistic, and recoil corrections are
also included. The low-energy theorem is shown to be satisfied. The relative
effects of the different terms as well as their effects on the determinations
of the polarizabilities are discussed at energies of 49, 69, and 95 MeV. The
cross-section is dominated by the seagull, polarizability, and electromagnetic
multipole interactions. Relativistic and pion-exchange terms are also
important, while recoil corrections and multipoles of L=2 and greater are
negligible. The calculation provides a reasonable description of the
experimental data points at 49 and 69 MeV, except for the point at the greatest
angle. The polarizabilities are difficult to determine at these energies due to
the size of the experimental error bars. No data has been published at 95 MeV
but a more accurate determination of the polarizabilities is likely at this
higher energy. Detailed calculations for all terms can be found in the
appendices.

"physics/9901003","Michael Byrne","Michael Byrne","The Duality of Nature: Why N Equals 10","Author believes that the statements are no longer valid",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Negative solutions are possible for Einstein's Special Relativity equation,
as well as Dirac's, Maxwell's, and Schrodinger's equations; and Schrodinger's
equation utilizes antitime to calculate quantum probabilities. Also, since no
ground state seems to exist for matter, Dirac predicted that negative matter
must exist to keep all of matter from disappearing into negative energy states.
And Einstein showed that all things are relative except the speed of light.
Together, these imply that 4 negative dimensions (Ds) are overlapped by the 4
positive Ds; that positive and negative matters reside in these 2 separate sets
of Ds; and that their separateness prevents their mutual annihilation. Light
would then exist as an oscillation of the interface between these 2 sets of Ds,
with the 2 relative matters varying equally on each side; thus allowing light
to remain constant. And since 2 negatives make a positive, the 2 sets would
move as one, even though they are opposites. This means that the 2 sets always
remain exactly overlapped; and so, the negative Ds remain disguised. Our
universe therefore could be a dual universe. Also, 8+2 Ds makes a total of 10
Ds; 4x4=16 interactions, and 10+16 = 26. So our 4 D world could act as a 10/26
D world; which matches the 2 sets within which string theory is self-
consistent. And this is why N =10. Also, an initial matter singularity would be
balanced by antimatter being infinitely spread out at the opposite end of time;
so a dual universe would allow an initial singularity to exist with both a
known position and momentum, without violating quantum mechanics. And since a
dual universe having two equal sets of Ds and matter would always be exactly
balanced; a dual universe would be extremely stable all thorough its existence.
And this means that our universe is likely to be a dual universe.
