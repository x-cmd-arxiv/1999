been used to construct object catalogs and to obtain photometric redshifts. The
effective field of view is $\simeq 70\times70$ arcsec$^2$, and the formal
$5\sigma$ limiting magnitudes (in a 2 FWHM aperture) are 26.3, 27.8, 27.5,
26.9, 25.2 in the $U$, $B$, $V$, $R$ and $I$ bands, respectively. Thanks to the
sub-arcsecond image quality, relatively long exposure time, and large
collecting area of the VLT, this is the deepest set of multicolor images ever
obtained from a ground-based telescope. Galaxy counts have been derived
independently in each band, and show no significant departures from previous
data from wider areas. A multicolor photometric catalog of all the galaxies
selected in the $R$ band has also been obtained and used to derive photometric
redshifts for all galaxies with $R \leq 26.5 $, using also the J,H and K
magnitudes from the NICMOS deep observations. A significant fraction (\simeq
28%)of the galaxies is placed at $z\geq 2$. Among them, six robust candidates
are found at $z \geq 2.5$ .

positive clustering out to separations ~50/h Mpc, with a smooth break on larger
scales and zero-crossing between 60 and 80/h Mpc. xi(s) is reasonably well
described by a shallow power law with \gamma~1.5 between 3 and 50/h Mpc, while
on smaller scales (0.2-2/h Mpc) it has a shallower slope (\gamma~ 1). We
examine the full effect of redshift-space distortions through the
two-dimensional correlation function xi(rp,pi), from which we project out the
real-space xi(r) below 10/h Mpc. This function is well described by a power-law
model (r/r_o)^{-\gamma}, with r_o=4.15^{+0.20}_{-0.21} h^{-1} Mpc and
\gamma=1.67^{+0.07}_{-0.09}. Comparison to other redshift surveys shows a
consistent picture in which clustering remains positive out to separations of
50/h Mpc or larger, in substantial agreement with the results obtained from
angular surveys like the APM and EDSGC. Also the shape of the two-point
correlation function is remarkably unanimous among these data sets, in all
cases requiring more power above 5/h Mpc (a `shoulder'), than a simple
extrapolation of the canonical xi(r)=(r/5)^{-1.8}. xi(s) for volume-limited
subsamples shows evidence of luminosity segregation only for the most luminous
sample with M_{b_J}\le -20.5. When redshift-space distortions are removed
through projection of xi(rp,pi), however, a weak dependence on luminosity is
seen at small separations also at fainter magnitudes. This effect is masked in
redshift space, as the mean pairwise velocity dispersion experiences a parallel
increase, basically erasing the effect of the clustering growth on xi(s).

energy distributions (SEDs) to facilitate the identification of similar objects
at high redshift in deep optical, infrared, and submm surveys.
  All three galaxies (VII Zw031 = IRAS F12112+0305, and IRAS F22491-1808) were
well detected at 230 nm. Two of the three were marginally detected at 140 nm.
The fluxes, together with ground-based optical and infrared photometry, are
used to compute SEDs over a wide wavelength range. The measured SEDs drop from
the optical to the ultraviolet, but the magnitude of the drop ranges from a
factor of ~3 in IRAS F22491-1808 to a factor of ~100 in VIIZw031. This is most
likely due to different internal extinctions. Such an interpretation is also
suggested by extrapolating to ultraviolet wavelengths the optical internal
extinction measured in VIIZw031. K-corrections are calculated to determine the
colors of the sample galaxies as seen at high redshifts. Galaxies like VIIZw031
have very low observed rest-frame UV fluxes which means that such galaxies at
high redshift will be extremely red or even missing in optical surveys. On the
other hand, galaxies like IRAS F12112+0305 and IRAS F22491-1808, if seen at
high redshift, would be sufficiently blue that they would not easily be
distinguished from normal field galaxies, and therefore, identified as ULIGs.

properly identifying the majority of ULIGs at high redshift.

triaxial systems. This increase is most dramatic in systems with shallow cusps
showing that it is not a direct consequence of scattering by a central density
cusp or black hole. In a recent study of stationary triaxial potentials
(Valluri & Merritt 1998) it was found that the most important elements that
define the structure of phase space are the two dimensional resonant tori. The
increase in the fraction of stochastic orbits in models with figure rotation is
a direct consequence of the destabilization of these resonant tori. The
presence of a large fraction of stochastic orbits in a triaxial bulge will
result in the evolution of its shape from triaxial to axisymmetric. The
timescales for evolution can be as short as a few crossing times in the bulges
of galaxies and evolution is accelerated by figure rotation. This suggests that
low luminosity ellipticals and the bulges of early type spirals are likely to
be predominantly axisymmetric.

distribution of the inverse compressibility, given according to Koopmans'
theorem by the distance between the two levels across the Fermi energy, evolves
from a Wigner distribution in the non-interacting limit to a shifted Gaussian
for strong interactions. On the other hand the nature of the distribution of
spacings between neighboring levels on the same side of the Fermi energy
(corresponding to energy differences between excited states of the system with
one missing or one extra electron) is not affected by the interaction and
follows Wigner-Dyson statistics. These results are derived analytically by
isolating and solving the appropriate Hartree-Fock equations for the two
levels. They are substantiated by numerical simulations of the full set of
Hartree-Fock equations for a disordered quantum dot with Coulomb interactions.
We find enhanced fluctuations of the inverse compressibility compared to the
prediction of Random Matrix Theory, possibly due to localization of the
wavefunctions around the edge of the dot. The distribution of the inverse
compressibility calculated from the discrete second derivative with respect to
the number of particles of the Hartree-Fock ground state energy deviates from
the distribution of the level spacing across the Fermi energy. The two
distributions have similar shapes but are shifted with respect to each other.
The deviation increases with the strength of the interaction thus indicating

fast decay results from the loss of coherence in the initial excited state.

find that the increase of exchange interaction mainly accelerates the spin
dynamics rather than the charge dynamics. A reduction of the hopping integrals,

resistance monitoring. These resistors showed a transition from superconducting
to insulating behaviour with increasing sheet resistance, occurring at a value
approximately equal to the quantum resistance for Cooper pairs, h/(4e^2).
  2. Combining the anodisation technique with lateral size minimisation by
shadow evaporation, devices in a single electron transistor-like configuration
with two weak links and a small island between these were made. Direct evidence
for the Coulomb blockade in the anodisation thinned niobium films was found
when the transport characteristics could be modulated periodically by sweeping
the voltage applied to a gate electrode placed on top of the structure.
  3. Conventional single electron transistors with Al base electrodes, AlO_x
barriers formed in situ by oxidation, and Nb top electrodes were made by
angular evaporation. The output current noise of such a transistor was measured
as a function of bias voltage, gate voltage, and temperature. The low frequency
noise was found to be dominated by charge input noise. The dependence of the
noise on the bias voltage is consistent with self-heating of the transistor
activating the noise sources.

nucleon (nuclear) targets is computed in QCD within the leading $\alpha_s \ln
{Q^2/\lambda_{QCD}^{2}}$ approximation. We show that the distribution of recoil
nucleons depends strongly on the angle between the momentum of the recoil
nucleon and the polarization vector of the target (or outgoing nucleon). This
dependence is especially sensitive to the spin flip skewed parton distribution
(SPD) $\widetilde E$. We argue also that the scaling for this spin asymmetry
sets in at lower Q^2 than that for the absolute cross section. Basing on the
chiral quark-soliton model of the nucleon we estimate quantitatively the spin
asymmetry. In the case of pi+ production this asymmetry is dominated at small t
by the contribution of the pion pole in the isovector SPD $\widetilde E$ as
required by PCAC. In the case of K0 production off a proton we find a large
enhancement of the cross section as compared to the case of pi0 production. For
the forward production of neutral pseudoscalar mesons off a deuteron target we
find the cross section should be zero for the zero deuteron helicity (along the
$\gamma^*D$ direction). We consider also cross sections of quasielastic
processes off nuclei including the feasibility to implant K+,rho-mesons into
nuclear volume.

to find a dual system $\gamma_{m,n}(k) = \gamma_m(k-an)$ such that each
function $f$ can be written as $f = \sum < f, \gamma_{m,n} > g_{m,n}$. The
mathematical theory usually addresses this problem in infinite dimensions

slope of the fibration is a numerical invariant associated to the fibration. In
this paper we explore how properties of the general fibre of $f$ and global
properties of S influence on the lower bound of the slope. First of all we
obtain lower bounds of the slope when the general fibre is a double cover. We
also obtain a lower bound depending as an increasing function on the relative
irregularity of the fibration, extending previous results of Xiao. We construct
several families of examples to check the assimptotical sharpness of our
bounds.

the modified quark-meson coupling model (within which the bag constant is
allowed to decrease with increasing density), namely the tendency for the size
of the bound nucleon to increase rapidly as the density rises. We also find
that, with the addition of correlations, both QMC and modified QMC are
consistent with the phenomenological equation of state at high density.

find that there are three contributions to this effect: initial-final state

equation of state (eos) the increase of the transverse velocity with increasing
beam energy is caused by the potential part. For a given beam energy the
collective transverse velocity is independent of the nuclear eos but the
relative contributions of potential and collisions differ. In view of the
importance of the potential interactions between the nucleons it is not evident
that the similarity of the radial velocities measured for fragments at beam
energies below 1 AGeV and that for mesons at beam energies above 2 AGeV is more
than accidental.

polar fluids can be investigated in computer experiment using not only the
charge fluctuations but also correlations corresponding to a current of moving
charges. This current can be associated with a generalized dynamical
polarization or separated into electric and magnetic components. The first
approach deals with the dielectric permittivity related to a generalized
conductivity, whereas the second one leads to the functions describing
polarization and magnetization fluctuations separately. The last way is only
the source to calculate the magnetic susceptibility for a system of interaction
sites. The transverse wavevector- and frequency-dependent dielectric functions
and magnetic susceptibility are evaluated for the TIP4P water model in a very
wide scale of wavelengths and frequencies using molecular dynamics simulations.
We demonstrate that the transverse part of the dielectric functions may differ
drastically from their longitudinal component. A relationship between the two
approaches is discussed and the limiting transition to the static dielectric
constant in the infinite-wavelength regime is analyzed. The propagation of
transverse electromagnetic waves in the TIP4P water is also considered.

behaviour of the current n+1th realization given a portion of the curve and the
structure of the previous n realizations. The model derived is based on the
cross-correlations between the current n+1th realization and the previous n
ones and the solution of the related least squares problem. As example we
applied the method to smoothed monthly sunspots numbers from SIDC archives, in
order to predict the behaviour of the current 23th solar cycle.
