which a population of asexually reproducing individuals, each of which can be
either altruist or non-altruist, is subdivided into $M$ reproductively isolated
groups (demes) of size $N$. The cost associated with being altruistic is
modelled by assigning the fitness $1- \tau$, with $\tau \in [0,1]$, to the
altruists and the fitness 1 to the non-altruists. In the case that the
altruistic disadvantage $\tau$ is not too large, we show that the finite $M$
fluctuations are small and practically do not alter the deterministic results
obtained for $M \to \infty$. However, for large $\tau$ these fluctuations
greatly increase the instability of the altruistic demes to mutations. These
results may be relevant to the dynamics of parasite-host systems and, in
particular, to explain the importance of mutation in the evolution of parasite
virulence.

  (a) massive close-binary systems will start to experience mass transfer
episodes after the first 4 Myr of the starburst evolution;
  (b) as a result of these mass transfer processes, stars of relatively low
initial mass can loose completely their envelope and become a WR. In this way,
the formation of WR stars is extended over longer than 15 Myr, and does not
stop at 6 Myr as predicted by models including only single stars;
  (c) WR stars can thus be coeval with red supergiants, which peak at around 10
Myr for solar metallicities;
  (d) the accretion of mass will originate relatively massive stars at ages for
which they should have already disappeared; these stars, together with the WR
stars formed in rather evolved clusters, increase the production of ionizing
photons, so that the H$\beta$ equivalent width will not drop as rapidly as
predicted by models considering only individual stars; and

of high-energy radiation in the form of high-mass X-ray binaries, not predicted

density field of the IRAS PSCz redshift survey. The PSCz redshift survey has
almost all-sky coverage and includes IRAS galaxies to a flux limit of 0.6 Jy.
Using maximum likelihood methods to examine (to first order) the distortion of
the galaxy pattern due to redshift coordinates, we have measured the parameter
\beta= \Omega^{0.6}/b. We also simultaneously measure (a) the undistorted
amplitude of perturbations in the galaxy distribution when a parameterised
power spectrum is assumed, or (b) the shape and amplitude of the real-space
power spectrum if the band-power in a set of passbands is measured in a step-
wise fashion. These methods are extensively tested on a series of CDM, \Lambda
CDM and MDM simulations and are found to be unbiased. We obtain consistent
results for the subset of the PSCz catalogue with flux above 0.75 Jy but
inclusion of galaxies to the formal flux limit of the catalogue gives
variations which are larger than our internal errors. For the 0.75 Jy catalogue
we find, in the case of a parameterised power spectrum, \beta=0.58\pm0.26 and
the amplitude of the real space power measured at wavenumber k=0.1 h/Mpc is
\Delta_{0.1}=0.42 \pm 0.03. Freeing the shape of the power spectrum we find
that \beta=0.47\pm 0.16 (conditional error), and \Delta_{0.1}=0.47 \pm 0.03.
The shape of the real-space power spectrum is consistent with a \Gamma= 0.2
CDM-like shape parameter, but does not strongly rule out a number of other
models. Finally by combining our estimate of the amplitude of galaxy clustering
and the distortion parameter we find the amplitude of mass fluctuations on a

of 50%.

revealed extreme variability on intermediate timescales. We wanted to determine
whether remarkable X-ray variability persistently occurs in PHL 1092, and we
also wanted to search for outstanding variability events that constrain
emission processes. Given the large luminosity of PHL 1092 (about 5x10^{45}
erg/s in the HRI band), we detect extremely rapid and large-amplitude X-ray
variability throughout our monitoring. The maximum observed variability
amplitude is a factor of about 14, and in the most rapid variability event the
HRI count rate increases by a factor of about 3.8 in a rest-frame time interval

1.3x10^{42} erg/s^2, making it the most extreme such event we are aware of from

radiative efficiency larger than can be achieved by accretion onto a Kerr black
hole rotating at the maximum plausible rate, although we point out that such
arguments depend upon the geometry of initial radiation release. Relativistic
motions of the X-ray source are probably causing the radiative efficiency limit

  publication in Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/307972",,"astro-ph",,"  The Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen (MHD) equation of state is a part of the Opacity
Project (OP), where it mainly provides ionization equilibria and level
populations of a large number of astrophysically relevant species. Its basic
concept is the idea of perturbed atomic and ionic states. The MHD equation of
state was originally restricted to the plasma of stellar envelopes, that is, to
relatively moderate densities, which should not exceed rho < 10**-2 g/cm**3.
However, helioseismological analysis has demonstrated that this restriction is
much too conservative. The principal feature of the original Hummer & Mihalas
(1988) paper was a simplified form of the Holtsmark microfield for randomly
distributed ions. An improved MHD equation of state (Q-MHD) is introduced. It
is based on a more realistic microfield distribution (Hooper 1966, 1968) that
includes plasma correlations. Comparison with an alternative post-Holtsmark
formalism (APEX) is made, and good agreement is shown. There is a clear
signature of the choice of the microfield distribution in the adiabatic index
gamma_1, which makes it accessible to present-day helioseismological analysis.
But since these thermodynamic effects of the microfield distribution are quite
small, it also follows that the approximations chosen in the original MHD
equation of state were reasonable. A particular feature of the original MHD
papers was an explicit list of the adopted free energy and its first- and
second-order analytical derivatives. The corresponding Q-MHD quantities are
given in the Appendix.

1705 (1992)], as extended to describe rheological properties [P. Sollich, F.
Lequeux, P. Hebraud and M.E. Cates, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2020 (1997)].) We
investigate the breakdown, near the glass transition, of the (generalized)
Stokes-Einstein relation between self-diffusion of a tracer particle and the
(frequency-dependent) viscosity of the system as a whole. This stems from the
presence of a broad distribution of relaxation times of which different moments
control diffusion and rheology. We also investigate the effect of flow
(oscillatory shear) on self-diffusion and show that this causes a finite
diffusivity in the temperature regime below the glass transition (where this
was previously zero). At higher temperatures the diffusivity is enhanced by a
power law frequency dependence that also characterises the rheological
response. The relevance of these findings to soft glassy materials (foams,
emulsions etc.) as well as to conventional glass-forming liquids is discussed.

decelerating market devaluations following all-time highs. For this, we propose
a simple market dynamics model in which the demand decreases slowly with
barriers that progressively quench in, leading to a power law decay of the
market price decorated by decelerating log-periodic oscillations. We document
this behaviour on the Japanese Nikkei stock index from 1990 to present and on
the Gold future prices after 1980, both after their all-time highs. We perform
simultaneously a parametric and non-parametric analysis that are fully
consistent with each other. We extend the parametric approach to the next order
of perturbation, comparing the log-periodic fits with one, two and three
log-frequencies, the latter one providing a prediction for the general trend in
the coming years. The non-parametric power spectrum analysis shows the
existence of log-periodicity with high statistical significance, with a
prefered scale ratio of $\lambda \approx 3.5$ for the Nikkei index $\lambda
\approx 1.9$ for the Gold future prices, comparable to the values obtained for
speculative bubbles leading to crashes.

is wide-spread. In this work the information about scattering bunch is proposed
to measure using the oscillation frequency of the tightened scanning wire. In
such way the system of radiation (or secondary particles) extraction and
measurement can be removed. Dependence of oscillations frequency on beam
scattering is determined by several factors, including changes of wire tension
caused by transverse force of the beam, influence of beam self field.
Preliminary calculations show that influence caused by wire heating will
dominate. We have studied strain gauges on the basis of vibrating wire from
various materials (tungsten, beryl bronze, niobium zirconium alloys). A scheme
of self oscillations generation by alternating current in autogeneration
circuit with automatic frequency adjustment was selected. Special method of
wire fixation and elimination of transverse degrees of freedom allow to achieve
relative stability better than 1E-5 during several days. For a tungsten wire
with a fixed end dependence of frequency on temperature was 1E-5/K.

"quant-ph/9901070","Bg Sidharth","B.G. Sidharth","Universe of Fluctuations II","13 pages, TeX",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc hep-th",,"  We throw further light on a recently discussed Kerr-Newman type formulation
of Fermions and the related cosmological scheme which predicted an ever
expanding universe, as indeed has subsequently been confirmed. In the spirit of
the correspondence principle, it is shown how the quark picture emerges at the
Compton wavelength and the Big Bang scenario at the Planck length. At the same
time we obtain a theoretical justification for the peculiar characteristics of
the quarks namely their fractional charge, handedness and confinement, as also
the order of magnitude of their masses, all of which were hitherto adhoc
features.

the subset of unmeasured particles is determined by the outcome of the
measurement. This first measurement may be thought of as a state preparation
for the remaining particles. In this paper, we examine how the duration of the
first measurement effects the state of the unmeasured subsystem. The state of
the unmeasured subsytem will be a pure or mixed state depending on the nature
of the measurement.
  In the case of quantum teleportation we show that there is an eigenvalue
equation which must be satisfied for accurate teleportation. This equation
provides a limitation to the states that can be accurately teleported.
