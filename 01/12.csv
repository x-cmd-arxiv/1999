resembling that of the Milky Way. Our goal is to assess whether a merger origin
for the stellar halo would leave observable fossil structure in the phase-space
distribution of nearby stars. We show how mixing of disrupted satellites can be
quantified using a coarse-grained entropy. Although after 10 Gyr few obvious
asymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration space,
strong correlations are still present in velocity space. We give a simple
analytic description of these effects, based on a linearised treatment in
action-angle variables, which shows how the kinematic and density structure of
the debris stream changes with time. By applying this description we find that
a single satellite of current luminosity $10^8 L_\sun$ disrupted 10 Gyr ago
from an orbit circulating in the inner halo (mean apocentre $\sim 12$ kpc)
would contribute about $\sim 30$ kinematically cold streams with internal
velocity dispersions below 5 km/s to the local stellar halo. If the whole
stellar halo were built by disrupted satellites, it should consist locally of
300 - 500 such streams. Clear detection of all these structures would require a
sample of a few thousand stars with 3-D velocities accurate to better than 5
km/s. Even with velocity errors several times worse than this, the expected
clumpiness should be quite evident. We apply our formalism to a group of stars
detected near the North Galactic Pole, and derive an order of magnitude
estimate for the initial properties of the progenitor system.

background of ionizing radiation. By that time a significant fraction of the
cosmic gas had already been incorporated into collapsed galactic halos with
virial temperatures below about 10000 K that were unable to cool efficiently.
We show that photoionization of this gas by the fresh cosmic UV background
boiled the gas out of the gravitational potential wells of its host halos. We
calculate the photoionization heating of gas inside spherically symmetric dark
matter halos, and assume that gas which is heated above its virial temperature
is expelled. In popular Cold Dark Matter models, the Press-Schechter halo
abundance implies that about 50-90% of the collapsed gas was evaporated at
reionization. The gas originated from halos below a threshold circular velocity
of 10-15 km/s. The resulting outflows from the dwarf galaxy population at
redshifts 5-10 affected the metallicity, thermal and hydrodynamic state of the
surrounding intergalactic medium. Our results suggest that stellar systems with
a velocity dispersion below about 10 km/s, such as globular clusters or the
dwarf spheroidal galaxies of the Local Group, did not form directly through
cosmological collapse at high redshifts.

very similar to that displayed by flat-spectrum/core-dominated quasars, which

result for massive halos with $M \ge M_*$ ($M_*$ is a characteristic non-linear

the Lagrangian clustering for the less massive halos $M < M_*. Our simulation
result however can be satisfactorily described, with an accuracy better than
15%, by the fitting formula of Jing for Eulerian bias under the assumption that
the Lagrangian clustering and the Eulerian clustering are related with a linear
mapping. It implies that it is the failure of the Press-Schechter theories for
describing the formation of small halos that leads to the inaccuracy of the Mo
& White formula for the Eulerian bias. The non-linear mapping between the
Lagrangian clustering and the Eulerian clustering, which was speculated as
another possible cause for the inaccuracy of the Mo & White formula, must at
most have a second-order effect. Our result indicates that the halo formation

between the metallicity and galactocentric distance of other old open clusters.

the last few years. As one of the exciting possibilities to explain these
observations, tidal disruption of a star by a supermassive black hole has been
proposed. In the present paper, we perform a detailed discussion of this and
other possible scenarios for the X-ray outburst in NGC 5905, and a comparison
of NGC 5905 and IC 3599 in outburst as well as in quiescence. To this end we
present (i) a thorough analysis of all ROSAT observations of NGC 5905, (ii)
optical photometry of NGC 5905 quasi-simultaneous to the X-ray outburst, (iii)
the first post-outburst optical spectra of NGC 5905 and high-resolution
post-outburst spectra of IC 3599, and (iv) photoionization models for the
high-excitation emission lines that were discovered in the optical outburst
spectrum of IC 3599. The investigated outburst models include, besides the
tidal disruption event, a supernova in dense medium, an accretion-disk
instability, an event of extreme gravitational lensing, and the X-ray afterglow
of a GRB. The optical spectra of both galaxies in quiescence are carefully
examined for signs of permanent low-level Seyfert-activity. Whereas IC 3599
shows several signs of activity, none is revealed for NGC 5905. At present, and
among the X-ray bursts, this makes NGC 5905 the only safe candidate for a tidal
disruption event in an otherwise non-active galaxy. We briefly comment on a
search for further highly variable objects on the basis of ROSAT observations.
Several with factors 10-20 are found.

relation, and find it to be very small. We also establish clearly defined
values for the smoothness parameter in the relation, finding its value to be at
least 0.88 at all redshifts in our simulations. From our results, obtained by
linking the simulation boxes back to source redshifts of 4, we are able to
observe the formation of structure in terms of the computed shear, and also
note that the major contributions to the shear come from a very broad range of
redshifts. We show the probability distributions for the magnification, source
ellipticity and convergence, and also describe the relationships amongst these
quantities for a range of source redshifts. We find a broad range of
magnifications and ellipticities; for sources at a redshift of 4, 97{1/2}% of
all lines of sight show magnifications up to 1.3 and ellipticities up to 0.195.
There is clear evidence that the magnification is not linear in the
convergence, as might be expected for weak lensing, but contains contributions
from higher order terms in both the convergence and the shear.

quantities are derived from the knowledge of the energy variation $\delta
E[\delta n]$ corresponding to a change $\delta n$ of the quasi-particle (QP)
distribution function $n \equiv {n_{k \sigma}}$. We show that the internal
energy $E[n]$ (or, more precisely, the thermodynamic potential $\Phi[n]$),
expressed as a function of the QP distribution $n$, can be interpreted as an
effective potential (in the sense of field theory), which is obtained from the
free energy by a Legendre transformation. This allows to obtain explicitly
$\delta\Phi$ (or $\delta E$) starting from a microscopic Hamiltonian and to
relate the Landau $f$ function to the forward-scattering two-particle vertex
without considering the collective modes as in the standard diagrammatic
derivation of FLT. Out-of-equilibrium properties are obtained by extending the
definition of the effective potential to space- and time-dependent
configurations. $\Phi[n]$ is then a functional of the Wigner distribution
function $n \equiv {n_{k \sigma}(r,t)}$. It contains information about both the
static and dynamic properties of the Fermi liquid. In particular, it yields the
quantum Boltzmann equation satisfied by $n_{k \sigma}(r,t)$. Finally, we show
how $\delta\Phi[\delta n]$ can be derived (in the static case) using a
finite-temperature renormalization-group approach. In agreement with previous
results based on this technique, we find that the Landau $f$ function is
defined by the fixed-point value of the $\Omega$-limit of the
forward-scattering two-particle vertex.

scalar R of the W_4 and a mass term for the scalar field. Thereby also the
gauge fields as well as the charged fermion field acquire a mass as in the

D Phi^2=0, where Phi is the modulus of the scalar field and D denotes the

of length in the theory, is compared to the so-called spontanous symmetry
breaking in the standard electroweak theory which is, actually, the choice of a

The numerical effect of the disagreement is rather small. The size of the

  The Spectra?","RevTex 8 pages, 1 figure, 1 table",,,"MKPH-T-99-02","hep-ph nucl-th",,"  It is argued that the baryon excitations group to four-dimensional partial
waves described by means of the three Rarita-Schwinger (RS) fields [(\sigma -1
)/2 ,(\sigma -1)/2]* [(1/2, 0)+(0,1/2)] with \sigma =2,4 and 6, where all
components happen to be occupied. In the O(4) decomposition of the \pi N
scattering amplitudes, the RS spin- and parity clusters appear as poles on the
complex energy plane, socalled H""ohler poles. This phenomenon indicates that
the symmetry of the \pi N scattering amplitude is O(4) and thereby the
space-time version of chiral symmetry, rather than O(3). Accordingly, the
baryon spectrum generating algebra is su(2)_I*su(3)_c*o(1,3)_{ls} rather than
su(6)_{sf} * su(3)_c * o(3)_l. The nucleon and \Delta spectra below \sim 2500
MeV are complete up to only 5 `missing' resonances. The three O(4) poles are
distributed over two distinct Fock spaces of opposite vacuum parities thus
defining the energy scale of the chiral phase transition for baryons. Within
this new symmetry scenario, the covariant description of the RS baryon clusters
is straightforward and their averaged masses are fitted by a Balmer-series like
formula emerging from a simple quark-diquark model in the O(4) basis with
Coulomb potential and a four-dimensional rigid rotator.

the connection in d=3 between pure-gauge theory and the theory with adjoint

theory lies, one encounters effects associated with the unbroken theory at a
finite value v\sim g, where dynamical mass generation of a gauge-symmetric
gauge- boson mass m\sim g^2 takes place, in addition to the Higgs-generated
non-symmetric mass M\sim vg. This dynamical mass generation is forced by the
infrared instability (in both 3 and 4 dimensions) of the pure-gauge theory. We
construct solitonic configurations of the theory with both m,M non-zero which

the 't Hooft-Polyakov (m=0) monopole to the pure-gauge nexus-vortex complex
