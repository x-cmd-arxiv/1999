  13 January 1999, Astrophyical Journal Letters",,"10.1086/311921",,"astro-ph",,"  We report the first near infrared (NIR) imaging of a circumstellar annular
disk around the young (~8 Myr), Vega-like star, HR 4796A. NICMOS coronagraph
observations at 1.1 and 1.6 microns reveal a ring-like symmetrical structure
peaking in reflected intensity 1.05 arcsec +/- 0.02 arcsec (~ 70 AU) from the
central A0V star. The ring geometry, with an inclination of 73.1 deg +/- 1.2
deg and a major axis PA of 26.8 deg +/- 0.6 deg, is in good agreement with
recent 12.5 and 20.8 micron observations of a truncated disk (Koerner, et al.
1998). The ring is resolved with a characteristic width of less than 0.26
arcsec (17 AU) and appears abruptly truncated at both the inner and outer
edges. The region of the disk-plane inward of ~60 AU appears to be relatively
free of scattering material. The integrated flux density of the part of the
disk that is visible (greater than 0.65 arcsec from the star) is found to be
7.5 +/- 0.5 mJy and 7.4 +/- 1.2 mJy at 1.1 and 1.6 microns, respectively.
Correcting for the unseen area of the ring yields total flux densities of 12.8
+/- 1.0 mJy and 12.5 +/- 2.0 mJy, respectively (Vega magnitudes = 12.92 /+-
0.08 and 12.35 +/-0.18). The NIR luminosity ratio is evaluated from these
results and ground-based photometry of the star. At these wavelengths
Ldisk(lambda)/L*(lambda) = 1.4 +/- 0.2E-3 and 2.4 +/- 0.5E-3, giving reasonable
agreement between the stellar flux scattered in the NIR and that which is
absorbed in the visible and re-radiated in the thermal infrared. The somewhat
red reflectance of the disk at these wavelengths implies mean particle sizes in
excess of several microns, larger than typical interstellar grains. The
confinement of material to a relatively narrow annular zone implies dynamical
constraints on the disk particles by one or more as yet unseen bodies.

show that in 1 dimension the total operation count using this algorithm can be
reduced to about 50% of the conventional convolution and downsampling by
2-operation for both orthonormal and biorthogonal filters. In the special case
of biorthogonal symmetric odd-odd filters, we show an implementation yielding a
total operation count of about 38% of the conventional method. In 2 dimensions
we show an implementation of this algorithm yielding a reduction in the total
operation count of about 70% when the filters are orthonormal, a reduction of
about 62% for general biorthogonal filters, and a reduction of about 70% if the
filters are symmetric odd-odd length filters. We further extend these results
to 3 dimensions. We also show how the SO_2(R)-method for implementing the
discrete wavelet transform may be exploited to compute short FIR filters, and
we construct edge mappings where we try to improve upon the degree of
preservation of regularity in the conventional methods. We also consider a

are solved for an incompressible binary system. The equilibrium configuration
of the binary system is given by a small deformation from the irrotational
Darwin-Riemann ellipsoid which is the solution at Newtonian order. It is found
that the orbital separation at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO)
decreases when one increases the compactness parameter $M_{\ast}/c^2 a_{\ast}$,
in which $M_{\ast}$ and $a_{\ast}$ denote the mass and the radius of a star,
respectively. If we compare the 1PN angular velocity of the binary system at
the ISCO in units of $\sqrt{M_{\ast}/a_{\ast}^3}$ with that of Newtonian order,
the angular velocity at the ISCO is almost the same value as that at Newtonian
order when one increases the compactness parameter. Also, we do not find the
instability point driven by the deformation at 1PN order, where a new sequence
bifurcates throughout the equilibrium sequence of the binary system until the
ISCO.
  We also investigate the validity of an ellipsoidal approximation, in which a
1PN solution is obtained assuming an ellipsoidal figure and neglecting the
deformation. It is found that the ellipsoidal approximation gives a fairly
accurate result for the total energy, total angular momentum and angular
velocity. However, if we neglect the velocity potential of 1PN order, we tend
to overestimate the angular velocity at the ISCO regardless of the shape of the
star (ellipsoidal figure or deformed figure).

deep inelastic scattering. Particular emphasis is placed on the part played by
the running of the coupling. It is shown that the solution factorizes into a
part describing the evolution in Q^2, and a constant part describing the input
distribution. The latter is infrared dominated, being described by a coupling
which grows as x decreases, and thus being contaminated by infrared
renormalons. Hence, for this part we agree with previous assertions that
predictive power breaks down for small enough x at any Q^2. However, the former
is ultraviolet dominated, being described by a coupling which falls like
1/(\ln(Q^2/\Lambda^2) + A(\bar\alpha_s(Q^2)\ln(1/x))^1/2)with decreasing x, and
thus is perturbatively calculable at all x. Therefore, although the BFKL
equation is unable to predict the input for a structure function for small x,
it is able to predict its evolution in Q^2, as we would expect from the
factorization theory. The evolution at small x has no true powerlike behaviour
due to the fall of the coupling, but does have significant differences from
that predicted from a standard NLO in alpha_s treatment. Application of the
resummed splitting functions with the appropriate coupling constant to an
analysis of data, i.e. a global fit, is very successful.

leapfrog framework, we directly involve principal angular velocities into the
integration, whereas orientational positions are expressed in terms of either
principal axes or quaternions. As a result, the rigidness of molecules appears
to be an integral of motion, despite the atom trajectories are evaluated
approximately. The algorithm derived is free of any iterative procedures and it
allows to perform both energy- and temperature-conserving simulations. The
corresponding integrators are time reversible but the symplectic behaviour is
only achieved in mean. Symplectic versions are also described. The provide the
conservation of volume in phase space precisely at each time step and,
moreover, lead to exact solutions for angular velocities in the inertial-motion
regime. It is shown that the algorithm exhibits excellent stability properties
and conserves the energy even somewhat better than the atomic-constraint
technique.
