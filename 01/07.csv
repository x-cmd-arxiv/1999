based on COBE and HI data. A decomposition of the Far-IR emission over the HI,
H^+ and H_2 Galactic gas components and the Cosmic Far InfraRed Background

  For the first time the far-IR emission of dust associated with the Warm
Ionised Medium (WIM) is evidenced. This component determined on about 25% of
the sky is detected at a 10 sigma level in the [200, 350]micron band. The best
representation of the WIM dust spectrum is obtained for a temperature of 29.1 K
and an emissivity law $tau/N_H+=3.8 \pm 0.8 10^{-26} (\lambda/250\mic)^{-1}
cm^2$. With a spectral index equal to 2, the emissivity law becomes
$\tau/N_H^+= 1.0 \pm 0.2 10^{-25} (\lambda/250\mic)^{-2} cm^2$, with a
temperature of 20 K, which is significantly higher than the temperature of dust
associated with HI gas. The variation in the dust spectrum from the HI to the
WIM component can be explained by only changing the upper cutoff of the Big
Grain size distribution from 0.1 micron to 30 nm. The detection of IR emission
of dust in the WIM significantly decreases the intensity of the CFIRB,
especially around 200 micron which corresponds to the peak of energy.

ray electrons in clusters of galaxies have been calculated, including the
effects of losses due to inverse Compton (IC), synchrotron, and bremsstrahlung
emission, and Coulomb losses to the intracluster medium (ICM). The combined
time scale for these losses reaches a maximum of ~3e9 yr for electrons with a
Lorentz factor ~300. Only clusters in which there has been a substantial
injection of relativistic electrons since z <~ 1 will have any significant
population of primary cosmic ray electrons at present. In typical models, there
is a broad peak in the electron energy distribution extending to gamma~300, and
a steep drop in the electron population beyond this. In clusters with current
particle injection, there is a power-law tail of higher energy electrons with
an abundance determined by the current rate of injection. A significant
population of electrons with gamma~300, associated with the peak in the
particle loss time, is a generic feature of the models. The IC and synchrotron
emission from these models was calculated. In the models, EUV and soft X-ray
emission are nearly ubiquitous. This emission is produced by electrons with
gamma~300. The spectra are predicted to drop rapidly in going from the EUV to
the X-ray band. The IC emission also extends down the UV, optical, and IR bands
with a fairly flat spectrum. Hard X-ray (HXR) and diffuse radio emission due to
high energy electrons (gamma~10e4) is present only in clusters which have
current particle acceleration. Assuming that the electrons are accelerated in
ICM shocks, one would only expect diffuse HXR/radio emission in clusters which
are currently undergoing a large merger.

brightness profiles of 14 clusters with $0.17 < z < 0.55$ are constructed and
fit to isothermal $\beta$ models. Where possible, we use both the HRI and PSPC

equilibrium, and spherical symmetry, we derive total X-ray masses within a
range of radii from 141 to $526 h^{-1}_{100}$ kpc. These masses are compared
with both the dynamical masses obtained from galaxy velocities and the
projected masses from published gravitational lensing studies. We find no
systematic bias between X-ray and dynamical methods across the sample, with an
average $M_{Dyn}/M_X=1.04\pm0.07$, although individual clusters exhibit mass
discrepancies up to a factor of 2. We estimate that the systematic effects due
to cooling flows, non-equilibrium systems and temperature gradients affect the
average mass ratio by no more than $15-20%$. Weak gravitational lensing masses
appear to be systematically higher than X-ray results by factors of $\sim50%$,
while strong lensing estimates show larger discrepancies (factors of
$\sim2.5$). However, these comparisons are complicated by the need to
extrapolate the X-ray data to larger or smaller radii. X-ray derived cluster
gas masses are calculated, from which we obtain a cluster baryon fraction of
$\sim5%h^{-3/2}_{100}$, yielding $\Omega_0 \sim0.3h^{-1/2}_{100}$.

for the domain decomposition. The SVT decomposes a whole space into polyhedra
and allows their flat borders to move by assigning different weights. The
forest method determines these weights based on the load balancing among
processors by means of the over-load diffusion (OLD). Moreover, since all the
borders are flat, before receiving the data from other processors, each
processor can collect enough data to calculate the gravity force with
precision. Both the SVT and the OLD are coded in a highly vectorizable manner
to accommodate on vector parallel processors. The parallel code based on the
forest method with the Message Passing Interface is run on various platforms so
that a wide portability is guaranteed. Extensive calculations with 15
processors of Fujitsu VPP300/16R indicate that the code can calculate the
gravity force exerted on 10^5 particles in each second for some ideal dark
halo. This code is found to enable an N-body simulation with 10^7 or more
particles for a wide dynamic range and is therefore a very powerful tool for
the study of galaxy formation and large-scale structure in the universe.

interferometer in the J=1-0 and J=2-1 lines of 12CO. Our maps show the
existence of a fast--rotating(130 km/s) molecular gas disk of radius r=110pc.
Several arguments support the existence of a bar potential in NGC4013. The
figure-of-eight pattern of the major axis p-v plot, the ring-like distribution
of gas, and the existence of gas emission at non-circular velocities are best
accounted by a bar. We have also detected gas at high z distances from the
plane (z=200-300pc). The latter component is related to a system of 4 Halpha
filaments of diffuse ionized gas that come out from the nucleus. The galactic
fountain model seems the best to account for the Halpha and CO filaments.
Although the peanut distortion can be spontaneously formed by a stellar bar in
the disk, gas at high z might have been ejected after a nuclear starburst. The
Halpha filaments start in the plane of the disk at r=200pc, and reach several
Kpc height at r=600pc, coinciding with the maximum peanut distortion. Although
a link between the bar and the box-shaped bulge in NGC4013 is suggested we find
noticeable differences between the results of previous numerical simulations
and the present observations. The discrepancy concerns the parameters of the
bar generating the peanut. We see in NGC4013 the existence of a strong ILR
region. The inclusion of a dissipative component, which remains to be
thoroughly studied, may change the evolution of the stellar peanut: although in
simulations the peanut appears initially near a marginal ILR, the inflow of gas
driven by the bar, can make two ILRs appear.

simulations developed during the last decade which are sufficient to handle all
the relevant dynamical aspects. First we discuss briefly the Hermite
integration scheme which is simple to use and highly efficient for advancing
the single particles. The main numerical challenge is in dealing with weakly
and strongly perturbed hard binaries. A new treatment of the classical
Kustaanheimo-Stiefel two-body regularization has proved to be more accurate for
studying binaries than previous algorithms based on divided differences or
Hermite integration. This formulation employs a Taylor series expansion
combined with the Stumpff functions, still with one force evaluation per step,
which gives exact solutions for unperturbed motion and is at least comparable
to the polynomial methods for large perturbations. Strong interactions between
hard binaries and single stars or other binaries are studied by chain
regularization which ensures a non-biased outcome for chaotic motions. A new
semi-analytical stability criterion for hierarchical systems has been adopted
and the long-term effects on the inner binary are now treated by averaging
techniques for cases of interest. These modifications describe consistent
changes of the orbital variables due to large Kozai cycles and tidal
dissipation. The range of astrophysical processes which can now be considered
by N-body simulations include tidal capture, circularization, mass transfer by
Roche-lobe overflow as well as physical collisions, where the masses and radii
of individual stars are modelled by synthetic stellar evolution.

polymer rings. A polymer configuration is modeled by a closed polygon drawn on
the square diagonal lattice, with possible crossings describing pairs of
strands of polymer passing on top of each other. Each polygon configuration can
be viewed as the two- dimensional projection of a particular knot. We study
numerically the statistics of large polygons with a fixed knot type, using a
generalization of the BFACF algorithm for self-avoiding walks. This new
algorithm incorporates both the displacement of crossings and the three types
of Reidemeister transformations preserving the knot topology. Its ergodicity
within a fixed knot type is not proven here rigorously but strong arguments in
favor of this ergodicity are given together with a tentative sketch of proof.
Assuming this ergodicity, we obtain numerically the following results for the
statistics of knotted polygons: In the limit of a low crossing fugacity, we
find a localization along the polygon of all the primary factors forming the
knot. Increasing the crossing fugacity gives rise to a transition from a
self-avoiding walk to a branched polymer behavior.

powder pattern broadened by a variation in lattice distortions. At lower
temperatures, the spectrum shifts and broadens. Both the shift and broadening
exhibit Curie-Weiss behavior, indicating that the shift measures the
polarization of the electron spin system, and the broadening reflects a
distribution of magnetic susceptibilities. This distribution may result from
variations of local susceptibility in the bulk of the sample or from
differences in demagnetizing factors among powder grains. The spectrum also
indicates that the lattice distortions do not change as the temperature lowers.
Spectral diffusion measurements suggest that the temperature dependence of the
spectrum shape does not result from freezing out of motion of magnetic
polarons. Variation of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation across the spectrum
indicate that magnetic fluctuations, not lattice vibrations, dominate nuclear
relaxation. Nuclear spin-lattice relaxation therefore measures electron spin
dynamics in this system. The magnetic field dependence of the spin-lattice
relaxation indicates that the electron spin-spin correlation function adopts
simple single exponential behavior with a slow field-independent correlation
time of 10^{-8} seconds near Tc. The spin-spin correlation function changes
form at higher temperatures, but remains slow. The spin-lattice relaxation

calibrated against precise measurements of the average beam energy between 41

  1.Each of SU(2) representation j yields the different quantum Lagrangian
density. As a consequence, theoretical observables depend on representation j
which can be treated as a new phenomenological parameter. 2.Quantum chiral
solitons exist and possess asymptotic behaviour consistent with the massive
Yukawa field fall. The asymptotic shape and PCAC relation leads to the correct
asymptotic equation coinciding with contribution of explicitly broken term. 3.A
nucleon and \Delta_{33}-resonance are the only stable states for irreducible
representations j=3/2 and j=2. Unphysical tower of states l_{spin} =l_{isospin}
is, therefore, terminated by choosing the appropriate SU(2) representations.

being previously unsolved by using various extensions of the model in the

However, significantly less effort is required to evaluate the integrals and
the methods are easily generalized to higher order graphs. Thus, even the most
complicated multiloop graph can be expressed in terms of analytic functions.
These techniques are then used to calculate the quadrupole moment of the
deuteron to three loops in the Kaplan, Savage, and Wise effective field theory.

problem in the 3D stochastic tomography, using simulated refractivity fields to
test the system and the impact of noise. Finally, we use data from the Kilauea

15 Km in height to produce 4D refractivity fields. Results are compared with

interpreted as the mathematical expression of the concept of complementarity,
quantifying the mutual disturbance necessarily taking place in a simultaneous
or joint measurement of incompatible observables. This interpretation has
already been criticized by Ballentine a long time ago, and has recently been
challenged in an experimental way. These criticisms can be substantiated by
using the generalized formalism of positive operator-valued measures, from
which a new inequality can be derived, precisely illustrating the Copenhagen
concept of complementarity. The different roles of preparation and measurement
in creating uncertainty in quantum mechanics are discussed.

monopole potential obtained by embedding the Abelian monopole solution in the
non-Abelian scheme. In this case, the doublet-monopole Hamiltonian is invariant
under operations consisting of a complex and one parametric Abelian subgroup in
S0(3.C). This symmetry results in a certain freedom in choosing a discrete
operator N(A) (A is a complex number) entering the complete set of quantum
variables. The same complex number A represents an additional parameter at the
basis functions. The generalized inversion like operator N(A) affords certain
generalized N(A)-parity selection rules. All the different sets of basis
functions Psi(A) determine the same Hilbert space. The functions Psi(A)
decompose into linear combinations of Psi(A=0): Psi(A) = F(A) Psi(A=0).
However, the bases considered turn out to be nonorthogonal ones when A is a
complex number; the latter correlates with the non-self-conjugacy of the N(A)
at complex A-s. The meaning of possibility to violate the quantum-mechanical
regulation on self-conjugacy as regards the operator N(A) is discussed. Also,
the problem of possible physical status for the matrix F(A) at real A-s is
considered in full detail: since the matrix belongs formally to the gauge group
SU(2), but being a symmetry for the Hamiltonian this F(A) generates linear
transformations on basis wave functions.
