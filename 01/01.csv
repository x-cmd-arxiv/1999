Universe is far from being homogeneous and, for the redshifts of interest to
rotation measures (RM), it is well described by the observed Ly-$\alpha$
forest. We use a log-normal distribution to model the Ly-$\alpha$ forest and
assume that a cosmological magnetic field is frozen into the plasma and is
therefore a function of the density inhomogeneities. The Ly-$\alpha$ forest
results are much less sensitive to the cosmological magnetic field coherence
length than those for a homogeneous universe and show an increase in the
magnitude of the expected RM for a given field by over an order of magnitude.
The forest also introduces a large scatter in RM for different lines-of-sight
with a highly non-gaussian tail that renders the variance and the mean RM
impractical for setting limits. The $median|{\rm RM}|$ is a better statistical
indicator which we use to derive the following limits using the observed RM for
QSOs between $z = 0$ and $z = 2.5$. We set $\Omega_b h^2 = 0.02$ and get for

analogy between a quantized vortex in a superfluid and an electron in a uniform

Peierls, Yoccoz, and Thouless, the cyclotron motion of a vortex is described by
the many-body wave function, which is a linear combination of Feynman wave
functions centered at different positions. An integral equation for the
weighting functions of the superposition is derived by minimizing the energy
functional. The matrix elements of the kernel are the overlaps between any two
displaced Feynman wave functions. A numerical study is conducted for a bosonic
superfluid based on a Hartree ground state. A one-to-one correspondence between
the rotational states of a vortex in a cylinder and the cyclotron states of an
electron in the central gauge is found. Like the Landau levels of an electron,
the energy levels of a vortex are highly degenerate. However, the gap between
two adjacent energy levels does not only depend on the quantized circulation,
but also increases with energy, and scales with the size of the vortex. The
fluid density is finite at the vortex axis and the vorticity is distributed in
the core region. The effective mass of a quantized vortex defined by the
inverse of the energy-level spacing is shown to be logarithmically divergent
with the size of the vortex.

\Theta:E\to [0,\pi/2] on the set of edges. Let P^* be a combinatorially
equivalent disk pattern on the plane with the same dihedral angle function. We
show that P and P^* differ only by a euclidean similarity.
  In particular, when the dihedral angle function \Theta is identically zero,
this yields the rigidity theorems of B. Rodin and D. Sullivan, and of O.
Schramm, whose arguments rely essentially on the pairwise disjointness of the
interiors of the disks. The approach here is analytical, and uses the maximum
principle, the concept of vertex extremal length, and the recurrency of a
family of electrical networks obtained by placing resistors on the edges in the
contact graph of the pattern.
  A similar rigidity property holds for locally finite disk patterns in the
hyperbolic plane, where the proof follows by a simple use of the maximum
principle. Also, we have a uniformization result for disk patterns.
  In a future paper, the techniques of this paper will be extended to the case
when 0 \le \Theta < \pi. In particular, we will show a rigidity property for a
class of infinite convex polyhedra in the 3-dimensional hyperbolic space.

with no isospin violation, for example, our expressions describe the
electromagnetic form factors of ^3H, pd->pd gamma, gamma ^3He-> pd, gamma

through the coupling of the photon to all possible places in the
(nonperturbative) strong interaction model. Moreover, once the proper identical
particle symmetry is incorporated into the integral eqations describing the
strong interactions, the gauging procedure automatically provides
electromagnetic transition currents with the proper symmetry. In this way the
gauging of equations method results in a unified description of strong and
