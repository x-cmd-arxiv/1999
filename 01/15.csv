also account for Compton reflection on the disk. This kind of coupling leads to
a strongly angle dependent spectrum with a reflection component much stronger
than in standard isotropic models, leading to unobserved reflection dominated

  On larger scales, the images confirm a previously known north-south triple
source extending 40 pc and elongated perpendicular to a 350-pc starburst disk.
Both lobes show evidence for free-free absorption near 2 GHz, probably due to
ionized gas with a density of 1-2 X 10^3 cm^{-3} in the innermost parts of the
starburst disk. The absorbing gas may be ionized by the active nucleus or by
local regions of enhanced star formation. The elongation of the 40-pc triple

different scales imply strong curvature in the inner part of the radio jet.
  The radio continuum from the 350-pc disk has a spectral index near -0.4 above
1.4 GHz and is plausibly energized by a massive burst of star formation. On VLA
scales, asymmetric and diffuse emission extends for more than 25 kpc. This
emission has a steep spectrum, linear polarization exceeding 50% at some
locations, and shares the symmetry axis of the 40-pc triple. The diffuse radio
source is probably generated by energy deposition from a slow-moving nuclear
jet, which conceivably could help energize the off-nuclear starburst as well.

835 r < 21 mag galaxies with redshifts 0.2 < z < 0.5. Both surveys have a
median redshift of z = 0.30. In order to obtain a rough estimate of the cosmic
variance, we analyze the two surveys independently. We measure the comoving
correlation length to be 3.70 +/- 0.13 h^-1 Mpc at z = 0.30 with a power-law
slope gamma = 1.77 +/- 0.05. Dividing the sample into low (0.2 < z < 0.3) and
high (0.32 < z < 0.5) redshift intervals, we see no evidence for a change in
the comoving correlation length over the redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.5. Similar
to the well-established results in the local universe, we find that
intrinsically bright galaxies are more strongly clustered than intrinsically
faint galaxies and that galaxies with little ongoing star formation, as judged
from the rest-frame equivalent width of the [OII]3727, are more strongly
clustered than galaxies with significant ongoing star formation. The rest-frame
pairwise velocity dispersion of the sample is 326^+67_-52 km s^-1, ~25% lower

perturbations follows a power law behavior, and exhibits a ``thermodynamical''

thermodynamical variable $M$, the inflation energy scale. Comparing this result
with the observed temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background,

agrees with our previous conclusion, drawn from a velocity resolved HI Br gamma

to the source galaxies. Even without internal HI absorption, comparison of the
distribution of simulated colors to the analytic approximations of Madau (1995)
and Madau et al (1996) reveals systematically different mean colors and
scatter. Differences arise in part because we use more realistic distributions
of column densities and Doppler parameters. However, there are also
mathematical problems of applying mean and standard deviation opacities, and
such application yields unphysical results. These problems are corrected using
our Monte Carlo approach. Including HI absorption internal to the galaxies
generaly diminishes the scatter in the observed colors at a given redshift, but
for redshifts of interest this diminution only occurs in the colors using the
bluest band-pass. Internal column densities < 10^17 cm^2 do not effect the
observed colors, while column densities > 10^18 cm^2 yield a limiting
distribution of high redshift galaxy colors. As one application of our
analysis, we consider the sample completeness as a function of redshift for a
single spectral energy distribution (SED) given the multi-color selection
boundaries for the Hubble Deep Field proposed by Madau et al (1996). We argue
that the only correct procedure for estimating the z>3 galaxy luminosity
function from color-selected samples is to measure the (observed) distribution
of redshifts and intrinsic SED types, and then consider the variation in color
for each SED and redshift. A similar argument applies to the estimation of the

one to construct a mass function which is less affected by the problem of
unresolved binaries (Gaudi & Gould). However, even with the method of
microlensing, the photometric detection of binaries is limited to binary
systems with relatively large separations of $b\gtrsim 0.4$ of their combined
Einstein ring radius, and thus the mass function is still not totally free from
the problem of unresolved binaries. In this paper, we show that by detecting
distortions of the astrometric ellipse of a microlensing event with high
precision instruments such as the {\it Space Interferometry Mission}, one can
detect close binaries at a much higher rate than by the photometric method. We
find that by astrometrically observing microlensing events, $\sim 50%$ of
binaries with separations of $0.1r_{\rm E}$ can be detected with the detection
threshold of 3%. The proposed astrometric method is especially efficient at
detecting very close binaries. With a detection threshold of 3% and a rate of
10%, one can astrometrically detect binaries with separations down to $\sim

of formation of light elements LiBeB. This comparison shows that Li-6 is either
undepleted or only moderatly depleted in the star of interest. The depletion of

four terminals. We identify correlations that transform as either ``odd'' or
``anti-symmetric'', or ``even'' or ``symmetric'' quantities under duality. We
show that the low frequency noise is colored, and that the deviations from
white noise are exactly related to the differential conductance. We show
explicitly that the relationship between the slope of the low frequency noise
spectrum and the differential conductance follows from an identity that holds
to {\it all} orders in perturbation theory, supporting the results implied by
the duality symmetry. This generalizes the results of quantum supression of the
finite frequency noise spectrum to Luttinger liquids and fractional statistics

monomers, freezing takes place at the microscopic length scale only, and can be
described by a 1-step replica symmetry breaking. The fact that the long-range
Coulomb interaction has no intrinsic length scale suggests that freezing in
random polyampholyte globules might take place at all length scales,
corresponding to an overlap parameter q(x) that increases continuously from
zero to its maximum value. Study of the polyampholyte globule within the
independent interaction approximation seems to confirm this scenario. However,
the independent interaction model has an important deficiency: it cannot
account for self-screening, and we show that the model is only reliable at
length scales shorter than the self-screening length. Using the more realistic
sequence model we prove that in the general case of a random heteropolymer
globule containing two types of monomers such that unlike monomers attract each
other, freezing at arbitrarily large length scales is not possible. For
polyampholyte globules this implies that beyond the self-screening length, the
freezing behavior is qualitatively the same as in the case of short-range
interactions. We find that if the polyampholyte globule is not maximally
compact, the degree of frustration is insufficient to obtain freezing.

using the replica technique with a replica symmetric (RS) ansatz. Then we find
an exact solution for this quantity valid in a neighborhood of $\alpha = 0$. An
analysis of this solution shows that the system must have a phase transition at
some finite value of $\alpha$. This transition shows a singularity in the third
derivative of the MI. As the RS solution turns out to be infinitely

is checked numerically in the validity domain of the exact solution.

results for the Higgs-mass dependence of the fermionic contributions are
compared with the results of an expansion in the top-quark mass up to
next-to-leading order. In the MSSM, results for the leading two-loop

fluctuations at preheating must be accompanied by resonant amplification of
scalar metric perturbations, since the two are united by Einstein's equations.
Furthermore, this ""metric preheating"" enhances particle production and leads to
gravitational rescattering effects even at linear order. In multi-field models
with strong preheating (q \gg 1), metric perturbations are driven nonlinear,
with the strongest amplification typically on super-Hubble scales (k \to 0).
This amplification is causal, being due to the super- Hubble coherence of the
inflaton condensate, and is accompanied by resonant growth of entropy
perturbations. The amplification invalidates the use of the linearized Einstein
field equations, irrespective of the amount of fine-tuning of the initial
conditions. This has serious implications at all scales - from the large-angle
cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies to primordial black holes. We
investigate the (q,k) parameter space in a two-field model, and introduce the
time to nonlinearity, t_{nl}, as the timescale for the breakdown of the
linearized Einstein equations. Backreaction effects are expected to shut down
the linear resonances, but cannot remove the existing amplification, which
threatens the viability of strong preheating when confronted with the CMB. We
discuss ways to escape the above conclusions, including secondary phases of
inflation and preheating solely to fermions. Finally we rank known classes of
inflation from strongest (chaotic and strongly coupled hybrid inflation) to
weakest (hidden sector, warm inflation) in terms of the distortion of the
primordial spectrum due to these resonances in preheating.

the $\Lambda K^{+}$ production proceeds via the excitation of the $N^*$(1650),

the nucleon-nucleon-meson vertices are determined by fitting the elastic
nucleon-nucleon scattering with an effective interaction based on the exchange
of these four mesons, while those at the resonance vertices are calculated from
the known decay widths of the resonances as well as the vector meson dominance
model. Available experimental data is described well by this approach. The
one-pion-exchange diagram dominates the production process at both higher and

crucial for this process. Finally, we find that the existence of a discrete
breather tends to soften the lattice in its immediate neighborhood, resulting
in high amplitude thermal fluctuation close to an existing discrete breather.
This in turn nucleates discrete breather creation close to a already existing
discrete breather.

studied as an excitable medium. It is shown that in the continuum limit the
system admits solutions in the form of the self-sustained shock waves traveling
with constant speed which depends only on the amount of the accumulated stress
in front of the wave. For a wide class of initial conditions the behavior of
the system is determined by these shock waves and the dynamics of the system
can be expressed in terms of their motion. The solutions in the form of the
periodic wave trains and sources of counter-propagating waves are analyzed. It
is argued that depending on the initial conditions the system will either tend
to synchronize or exhibit chaotic spatiotemporal behavior.

helium out of the metastable state 2s $^1S_0$. The continuum dressing with a
1064 nm laser, couples the same region of the continuum to the {4s $^1S_0$}
state. The experimental data, presented for a range of intensities, show
pronounced ionization suppression (by as much as 70% with respect to the
far-from-resonance value) as well as enhancement, in a Beutler-Fano resonance
profile. This ionization suppression is a clear indication of population
trapping mediated by coupling to a contiuum. We present experimental results
demonstrating the effect of pulse delay upon the LICS, and for the behavior of
LICS for both weak and strong probe pulses. Simulations based upon numerical
solution of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation model the experimental results. The
atomic parameters (Rabi frequencies and Stark shifts) are calculated using a
simple model-potential method for the computation of the needed wavefunctions.
The simulations of the LICS profiles are in excellent agreement with
experiment. We also present an analytic formulation of pulsed LICS. We show
that in the case of a probe pulse shorter than the dressing one the LICS
profile is the convolution of the power spectra of the probe pulse with the
usual Fano profile of stationary LICS. We discuss some consequences of
deviation from steady-state theory.

into vacuum in proximity to the top electrode edge. The condition for the
deep-depletition breakdown near the edge of the top metal electrode is
analytically found in terms of ratio of the insulator thickness to the maximum
(breakdown) width of the semiconductor depletition region: this ratio should be
less than 2/(3 \pi - 2) = 0.27. The influence of a neighboring metal electrode
and an electrode thickness on this condition are analyzed. Different practical

but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and

state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\""odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  The present fourth part of this series is devoted mainly to the fibre bundle
description of mixed quantum states. We show that to the conventional density
operator there corresponds a unique density morphism (along paths) for which
the corresponding equations of motion are derived. It is also investigated the
bundle description of mixed quantum states in the different pictures of motion.
We calculate the curvature of the evolution transport and prove that it is
curvature free iff the values of the Hamiltonian operator at different moments
commute.
