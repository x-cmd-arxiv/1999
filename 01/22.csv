for galaxies at z~2 is estimated for galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field by using
a U < 27 complete sub-sample.
  (i) It is confirmed that the amplitude of the correlation can be corrected
for the integral constraint without having to make assumptions about the shape
of the correlation function and by avoiding the introduction of linear error
terms. The estimate using this technique is w(5'') = 0.10 \pm 0.09.
  (ii) If the biases introduced in faint galaxy selection due to obscuration by
large objects are not corrected for by masking areas around them, then the
estimate would be w(5'') =0.16\pm 0.07.
  (iii) The effective (3-D) galaxy pair separation at 5'' and this redshift
range is ~ 25-250 /h kpc, so the correction to the spatial correlation function
\xi(r) due to exclusion of overlapping galaxy dark matter haloes should be
considered. For clustering stable in proper units in an \Omega=1,\lambda=0
universe, our w(5\arcs) estimate (a) implies a present-day correlation length
of r_0 ~ 2.6^{+1.1}_{-1.7}/h Mpc if halo overlapping is ignored, but (b) for a
present-day correlation length of r_0=5.5/h Mpc implies that a typical halo
exclusion radius is r_halo=70^{+420}_{-30}/h kpc.
  (iv) The decreasing correlation period (DCP) of a high initial bias in the
spatial correlation function is not detected at this redshift. For an
\Omega=1,\lambda=0 universe and (proper) stable clustering, possible detections
of the DCP in other work would imply that \xi at redshifts greater than z_t =
1.7\pm0.9 would be [(1+z)/(1+z_t)]^{2.1\pm3.6} times higher than at z_t, which
is consistent with our lack of a detection at z ~ 2.

of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the 2 degree Field survey through to
space-based ultraviolet satellites such as GALEX) will provide the opportunity
and challenge of understanding how galaxies of different spectral type evolve
with redshift. Techniques have been developed to classify galaxies based on
their continuum and line spectra. Some of the most promising of these have used
the Karhunen and Loeve transform (or Principal Component Analysis) to separate
galaxies into distinct classes. Their limitation has been that they assume that
the spectral coverage and quality of the spectra are constant for all galaxies
within a given sample. In this paper we develop a general formalism that
accounts for the missing data within the observed spectra (such as the removal
of sky lines or the effect of sampling different intrinsic rest wavelength
ranges due to the redshift of a galaxy). We demonstrate that by correcting for
these gaps we can recover an almost redshift independent classification scheme.
  From this classification we can derive an optimal interpolation that
reconstructs the underlying galaxy spectral energy distributions in the regions
of missing data. This provides a simple and effective mechanism for building
galaxy spectral energy distributions directly from data that may be noisy,
incomplete or drawn from a number of different sources.

estimates of the temperature of the gas for most of the clusters in the sample,
we apply both the deprojection technique and model fitting to the surface
brightness profiles to constrain the gas and dark matter distributions under
the assumption that the gas is both isothermal and hydrostatic.
  Applying robust estimators, we find that the gas fraction within r_{500} of
the clusters in our sample has a distribution centred on f_gas(r_{500}) = 0.168
h_{50}^{-1.5}. The gas fraction ranges from 0.101 to 0.245 at the 95 per cent
confidence level. The values of f_gas show highly significant variations
between individual clusters, which may be explained if the dark matter has a
significant baryonic component. Within a cluster, the average radial dependence
of the gas mass fraction increases outward as r^s, with s~0.20. Combining these
results with those of primordial nucleosynthesis calculations and the current
estimate of H_0, the above central location implies \Omega_{0, m} < 0.56 at the

interpreting the CNO results for constraints on stellar evolution theories,
careful attention has been paid to the comparison abundances, i.e., the present
day abundances of SMC nebulae and B-dwarf stars. These new results are also
compared to published results from F-K supergiant analyses, and found to be in
good agreement when both sets of data are carefully examined as differential
(SMC minus Galactic standard) abundances.
  With the exception of nitrogen, very small star-to-star abundance variations
are found for all elements in this analysis. The N variations are not predicted
by standard stellar evolution models. Instead, the results support the new
predictions reported from rotating stellar models, where the range in nitrogen
is the result of partial mixing of CN-cycled gas from the stellar interior due
to main-sequence rotation at different rates (c.f., Langer & Heger 1998). The
overall overabundance of nitrogen in the sampled stars also implies these stars
have undergone the first dredge-up in addition to having been mixed while on
the main-sequence.
  The alpha-elements (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti) have similar underabundances to Fe,
which is not the same as seen in metal-poor stars in the solar neighborhood of
the Galaxy. In addition, certain light s-process elements (Zr, Ba) are slightly
more underabundant than Fe, which is predicted by the bursting chemical

providing signatures of small halos, is a natural way to explore multi-phase

explicitly considering the relaxation process between the ions and electrons by
N-body and hydrodynamical simulations. When two subclusters collide each other,
a bow shock is formed between the centers of two substructures and propagate in
both directions along the collision axis. The shock primarily heats the ions
because the kinetic energy of an ion entering the shock is larger than that of
an electron by the ratio of masses. In the post-shock region the energy is
transported from the ions to electrons via Coulomb coupling. However, since the
energy exchange timescale depends both on the gas density and temperature,
distribution of electron temperature becomes more complex than that of the
plasma mean temperature, especially in the expanding phase. After the collision
of two subclusters, gas outflow occurs not only along the collision axis but
also in its perpendicular direction. The gas which is originally located in the
central part of the subclusters moves both in the parallel and perpendicular
directions. Since the equilibrium timescale of the gas along these directions
is relatively short, temperature difference between ions and electrons is
larger in the directions tilted by the angles of $\pm 45^\circ$ with respect to
the collision axis. The electron temperature could be significantly lower that

claimed that the clump of red giants in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) of
composite stellar populations should present an extension to lower
luminosities, which goes down to about 0.4 mag below the main clump. This
feature is made of stars just massive enough for having ignited helium in
non-degenerate conditions. In this paper, we go into more details about the
origin and properties of this feature. We first compare the clump theoretical
models with data for clusters of different ages and metallicities, basically
confirming the predicted behaviours. We then refine the previous models in
order to show that: (i) The faint extension is expected to be clearly separated
from the main clump in the CMD of metal-rich populations, defining a secondary
clump by itself. (ii) It should be present in all galactic fields containing ~1
Gyr old stars and with mean metallicities higher than about Z=0.004. (iii) It
should be particularly strong, if compared to the main red clump, in galaxies
which have increased their star formation rate in the last Gyr or so of their
evolution. In fact, secondary clumps similar to the model predictions are
observed in the CMD of nearby stars from Hipparcos data, and in those of some
LMC fields observed to date. There are also several reasons why this secondary
clump may be missing or hidden in other observed CMDs of galaxy fields (e.g.
photometric errors or differential absorption larger than 0.2 mag).
Nonetheless, this structure may provide important constraints to the star
formation history of Local Group galaxies. We comment also on the intrinsic
luminosity variation and dispersion of clump stars, which may limit their use
as either absolute or relative distance indicators.

site Coulomb and exchange interactions result in a total local spin of 1 rather
than 1/2 and especially an orbital occupation which removes the orbital
degeneracies and the freedom for orbital ordering. The calculated exchange
interaction parameters lead to a magnetic structure consistent with experiment
again without the need of orbital ordering. While the low-temperature
monoclinic distortion of the corundum crystal structure produces a very small
effect on electronic structure of v2o3, the change of magnetic order leads to
drastic differences in band widths and band gaps. The low temperature
monoclinic phase clearly favors the experimentally observed magnetic structure,
but calculations for corundum crystal structure gave two consistent sets of
exchange interaction parameters with nearly degenerate total energies
suggesting a kind of frustration in the paramagnetic phase. These results
strongly suggest that the phase transitions in V2O3 which is so often quoted as

the models with data. We find that these spectra are reproduced by Quantum
Molecular Dynamics (QMD) and Boltzmann Uehling Uhlenbeck (BUU) calculations.
Models like Boltzmann Langevin (BL) in which additional fluctuations in
momentum space are introduced overpredict the proton yield at very high
energies. The BL approach has been successfully used to describe the recently
measured very subthreshold kaon production assuming that the fluctuations
provide the necessary energy to overcome the threshold in two body collisions.

assumptions to standard quantum mechanics. We generalize the Liouville equation
just by requiring the dynamical semigroup property of time evolution and
dropping the unitarity requirement. With no approximations and statistical
assumptions we find a generalized Liouville equation which depends on two
characteristic time t1 and t2 and reduces to the usual equation in the limit t1
= t2 -> 0. However, for t1 and t2 arbitrarily small but finite, our equation
can be written as a finite difference equation which predicts state reduction
to the diagonal form in the energy representation. The rate of decoherence
becomes faster at the macroscopic limit as the energy scale of the system
increases. In our approach the evolution time appears, a posteriori, as a
statistical variable with a Poisson-gamma function probability distribution as
if time evolution would take place randomly at average intervals t2 each
evolution having a time width t1. This view point is supported by the
derivation of a generalized Tam Mandelstam inequality. The relation with
previous work by Milburn, with laser and micromaser theory and many
