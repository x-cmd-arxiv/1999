X-1 during the active portion of its 16.55-d intensity cycle. The observations
spanned 10 days, including 56% coverage for 7 d, and allowed us to find time
segments which clearly demonstrate continuous evolution along the horizontal,
normal, and flaring branches (HB/NB/FB) of a Z-source low-mass X-ray binary.
These results confirm and extend the behavior we inferred from earlier
observations. Here we study the continuous evolution of the Fourier power
spectra and the energy spectra around the complete hardness-intensity track. A
narrow quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) peak, previously observed in the power
spectra at 1.3-32 Hz, increases in frequency from 12 Hz to 25 Hz moving down a
vertical extension of the HB in the hardness-intensity diagram. These
horizontal branch QPOs (HBOs) occur near 30 Hz and fade in strength on the
horizontal portion of the HB, while a broad peak in the power spectrum arises
near 4 Hz. This peak becomes much more prominent along the NB and remains near
4 Hz (the normal branch QPOs, or NBOs). On the FB, neither QPO is present and
the power spectrum is dominated by very low frequency noise. We also found that
each branch of the spectral track is associated with a specific type of
evolution of the energy spectrum. We explored various models for the energy
spectrum and parameterized the evolution of the spectrum in terms of a
two-component model consisting of a multi-temperature ""disk blackbody"" and a
higher-temperature (~2 keV) blackbody. We also show that an unusual line- or
edge-like feature occurs at ~10 keV in energy spectra from the FB and lower NB.
This unusual feature is very similar to one seen on the FB and lower NB of the
Z source GX 5-1.

the boson superfluid. At finite temperatures, the properties of the bosons are
different from those of the strange metal phase and lead to modified gauge
field fluctuations. As a result, the spin gap phase can be stabilized in the
quantum critical and quantum disordered regime of the boson system. We also
show that the regime of quantum disordered bosons with the paired fermions can

feature of reheating in an inflationary cosmology. Coherent oscillations of the

instability. In a previous paper (hep-ph/9709273) it was shown that homogeneous
(i.e. space independent) noise leads to an increase of the generalized Floquet
exponent for all modes, at least if the noise is temporally uncorrelated. Here
we extend the results to the physically more realistic case of spatially
inhomogeneous noise. We demonstrate - modulo some mathematical fine points
which are addressed in a companion paper - that the Floquet exponent is a non-
decreasing function of the amplitude of the noise. We provide numerical
evidence for an even stronger statement, namely that in the presence of
inhomogeneous noise, the Floquet exponent of each mode is larger than the
maximal Floquet exponent of the system in the absence of noise.
