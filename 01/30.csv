for spectral index variations across Cas A. The images were spatially filtered

the knots outside the bright ring. Analysis of the 26 brightest peaks gives
statistical evidence for spectral index variations throughout the remnant. The
high frequency spectra confirm and extend the spectral variations seen
previously at lower frequencies. The spectra are largely consistent with
different power laws, and not curved spectra. This provides strong support for
local variations in the acceleration of relativistic particles in Cas A.

in four large (>1 degree^2) regions centered on diffuse interstellar dust

than unity). Our goal in studying these stars is to investigate the properties
of the cirrus clouds. A comparison of the observed stellar surface density
between on-cloud and off-cloud regions as a function of apparent magnitude in
each of the five bands effectively yields a measure of the extinction through
each cloud. For two of the cirrus clouds, this method is used to derive UBVRI
star counts-based extinction curves, and U-band counts are used to place
constraints on the cloud distance. The color distribution of stars and their
location in (U-B, B-V) and (B-V, V-I) color-color space are analyzed in order
to determine the amount of selective extinction (reddening) caused by the
cirrus. The color excesses, A_lambda-A_V, derived from stellar color histogram
offsets for the four clouds, are better fit by a reddening law that rises
steeply towards short wavelengths [R_V==A_V/E(B-V)<=2] than by the standard law
(R_V=3.1). This may be indicative of a higher-than-average abundance of small
dust grains relative to larger grains in diffuse cirrus clouds. The shape of
the counts-based effective extinction curve and a comparison of different
estimates of the dust optical depth (extinction optical depth derived from
background star counts/colors; emission optical depth derived from far infrared
measurements), are used to measure the degree of clumpiness in clouds. The set
of techniques explored in this paper can be readily adapted to the Sloan

Galaxies are classified into 3 rough morphological types according to their
visual appearance (E/S0s, Spirals, Sdm/dE/Irr/Pec's), and redshift
distributions are constructed for each type. The most striking feature is the
abundance of low to moderate redshift Sdm/dE/Irr/Pec's at I < 19.5. This
confirms that the faint end slope of the luminosity function (LF) is steep
(alpha < -1.4) for these objects. We also find that Sdm/dE/Irr/Pec's are fairly
abundant at moderate redshifts, and this can be explained by strong luminosity
evolution. However, the normalization factor (or the number density) of the LF
of Sdm/dE/Irr/Pec's is not much higher than that of the local LF of
Sdm/dE/Irr/Pec's. Furthermore, as we go to fainter magnitudes, the abundance of
moderate to high redshift Irr/Pec's increases considerably. This cannot be
explained by strong luminosity evolution of the dwarf galaxy populations alone:
these Irr/Pec's are probably the progenitors of present day ellipticals and
spiral galaxies which are undergoing rapid star formation or merging with their
neighbors. On the other hand, the redshift distributions of E/S0s and spirals
are fairly consistent those expected from passive luminosity evolution, and are
only in slight disagreement with the non-evolving model.

the pseudo Goldstone and $\eta$ Higgs states must have masses above 220 GeV,

This restores the good high energy behaviour of the cross section and, in
particular, makes possible the identification of the Higgs resonance in the

proportional to the off-shellness of the W bosons, cancel against similar terms

having to resort to the lengthy calculation of the complete set of diagrams. In

that decoherence time is close to relaxation time. This is at variance to the
claims by authors who studied the same system but used a different coupling

higher-spin analogue of the anti-ferroelectric six-vertex model, which is
constructed by inserting spin 1/2 to spin 1 lines: $... C^3 \otimes C^3 \otimes
C^2 \otimes C^3 \otimes C^3 ... $. We formulate the problem in terms of
representation theory of quantum affine algebra $U_q(hat{sl}_2)$. We derive an
exact formula for the spontaneous staggered polarization for our model, which
corresponds to Baxter`s formula for the six-vertex model.
