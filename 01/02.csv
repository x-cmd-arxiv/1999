medium leads to an effect which is exposed in the present note as the genuine
driving force of stabilization of large-scale structure. The conception of
`adhesive gravitational clustering' is advanced to interlock the fairly
well-understood epoch of formation of large-scale structure and the onset of
virialization into objects that are dynamically in equilibrium with their
large-scale structure environment. The classical `adhesion model' is opposed to
a class of more general models traced from the physical origin of adhesion in
kinetic theory.

cross-section magnetic flux tube is constructed. The cosmic solenoid is modeled
by an elastic superconductive surface which separates the Melvin core from the
surrounding flat conic structure. We show that a given amount $\Phi$ of
magnetic flux cannot be confined within a cosmic solenoid of circumferential
radius smaller than $\frac{\sqrt{3G}}{2\pi c^2}\Phi$ without creating a conic
singularity. Gauss-Codazzi matching conditions are derived by means of a
self-consistent action. The source term, representing the surface currents, is
sandwiched between internal and external gravitational surface terms. Surface
superconductivity is realized by means of a Higgs scalar minimally coupled to
projective electromagnetism. Trading the 'magnetic' London phase for a dual
'electric' surface vector potential, the generalized quantization condition
reads: $e/{hc} \Phi + 1/e Q=n$ with $Q$ denoting some dual 'electric' charge,
thereby allowing for a non-trivial Aharonov-Bohm effect. Our conclusions
persist for dilaton gravity provided the dilaton coupling is sub-critical.

expectation values that are both D- and F-flat (to all orders in the
superpotential) can simultaneously break the anomalous U(1)_A and give heavy
mass to all phenomenologically dangerous exotic states, decoupling them from
the low energy spectrum. For this model, some anomaly cancelling directions
actually decouple all MSSM exotics, producing the MSSM as the effective field
theory just below the string scale. This model realizes Witten's conjecture of
possible equivalence between the string scale M_S and the MSSM unification

the constancy of the one-way speed of light in all inertial frames of
reference, the special theory of relativity uses the assumption about the
Euclidean structure of gravity-free space and the homogeneity of gravity-free
time in the usual inertial coordinate system. Introducing the so-called primed
inertial coordinate system, in addition to the usual inertial coordinate
system, for each inertial frame of reference, we assume the flat structures of
gravity-free space and time in the primed inertial coordinate system and,
hence, their generalized Finslerian structures in the usual inertial coordinate
system. We further modify the special theory of relativity by combining the
alternative assumption with the two postulates (i) and (ii). The modified
special relativity theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite
speed c-prime in the primed inertial coordinate system and finite speed c in
the usual inertial coordinate system. It involves the c-prime-type Galilean
transformation between any two primed inertial coordinate systems and the
localized Lorentz transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate
systems. The physical principle in the modified special relativity theory is:
the c-prime-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system
plus the transformation from the primed to the usual inertial coordinate
systems. It combines with the quantum mechanics theory to found a convergent
and invariant quantum field theory. We produce corrections to the Maxwellian
velocity and velocity rate distributions for free particles. The detection of
velocity and velocity rate distributions for free particles can serve as the
tests to investigate the local structures of gravity-free space and time.
