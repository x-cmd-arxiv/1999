Various modes of accretion are distinguished, corresponding to accretion at
rates from well below to well above the Eddington rate. The importance of mass
loss is emphasized when the accreting gas cannot radiate and it is asserted
that a strong wind is likely to be necessary to carry off mass, angular
momentum and energy from the accreting gas. The possible importance of the
black hole spin in the formation of jets and in dictating the relative
importance of non-thermal emission over thermal radiation is discussed.

  Of the large number of possible origins of extragalactic diffuse gamma-ray

likely candidates. However, some of our recent analyses indicate that only 25
percent of the diffuse extragalactic emission measured by SAS-2 and EGRET can
be attributed to unresolved gamma-ray blazars.
  Therefore, other sources of diffuse extragalactic gamma-ray emission must
exist.

implying an apparent energy $E \ge 3 \times 10^{54} erg$, and a peak luminosity
$L_{max} \ge 6 \times10^{53}erg/s$, assuming isotropic emission. This energy is
ten times larger than hitherto measured and in excess of the rest mass of the
sun. Optical observations have revealed an associated galaxy displaced from the
line of sight by $\sim 0.6''$. This raises the possibility that the burst is
enhanced by gravitational lensing. We argue that existing observations probably
only allow magnifications $\mu>400$ if the galaxy is at z_d=1.60 and the burst
originates at much higher redshift. It should be possible to exclude this
possibility by examining the burst time structure. If, as we anticipate,
multiple imaging can be excluded, GRB 990123 remains the most intrinsically
luminous event yet observed in its entirety.

Lagrangian densities are Chern-Simons forms for the connection of a
supersymmetric extension of the anti-de Sitter algebra. The superalgebras are
the supersymmetric extensions of the AdS algebra for each dimension, thus
completing the analysis of van Holten and Van Proeyen, which was valid for N=1
and for D=2,3,4,mod 8. The Chern-Simons form of the Lagrangian ensures
invariance under the gauge supergroup by construction and, in particular, under
local supersymmetry. Thus, unlike standard supergravity, the local
supersymmetry algebra closes off-shell and without requiring auxiliary fields.
The Lagrangian is explicitly given for D=5, 7 and 11. In all cases the
dynamical field content includes the vielbein, the spin connection, N
gravitini, and some extra bosonic ``matter'' fields which vary from one
dimension to another. The superalgebras fall into three families: osp(m|N) for
D=2,3,4, mod 8, osp(N|m) for D=6,7,8, mod 8, and su(m-2,2|N) for D=5 mod 4,
with m=2^{[D/2]}. The possible connection between the D=11 case and M-Theory is

background antisymmetric tensor field in matrix models. In the present paper we
clarify the dual nature of both descriptions. Namely the noncommutativity of
conjugate momenta of the D-brane coordinates realizes the target space
structure, whereas noncommutativity of the coordinates themselves realizes
world volume structure. We explicitly construct a boundary state for the
Dirichlet boundary condition where the string boundary is adhered to the
D-brane on the noncommutative torus. There are non-trivial relations between
the parameters appeared in the algebra of the coordinates and that of the

excitative (72.9%); there are also a small amount of PC showing inhibitive
(10.2%) or no (16.9%) response to HA. (2) Different from the conventional
opinion, HA's excitative effect on PC is mutually conducted by H1 and H2
receptors; the antagonist for H1 receptor could weaken HA's excitative effect
on PC, while the antagonist for H2 receptor could weaken or even block the
excitative effect of HA on PC. (3) PC's reaction to HA is related to its
intrinsic discharge frequency; there exists a frequency at which PC is highly
sensitive to HA, and well above this frequency PC becomes stable against HA.
These results indicate that the histaminergic afferent fibre can adjust PC's
electric activities by releasing HA, and thereby influence the global function
of the cerebellar cortex; and that just like the $\gamma $ region of cerebrum,
cerebellum may also have some sort of characteristic frequency.
