Wirtanen is oblate along the spin-axis with a ratio of equatorial to polar

unraveling a robust quadratic correlation between the core radius r_c and the
slope parameter beta. We quantified the shape of each gas density profile by
the variation with radius of the logarithmic slope, \alpha_n. The bi-weight
dispersion of \alpha_n among the clusters is less than 20% for any given scaled
radii above x=0.2. There is a clear minimum spread at x=0.3, which is related
to the existence of a correlation between r_c and \beta. These ensemble
properties are insensitive to the exact treatment of a possible central excess
when fitting the profiles. On the other hand the scatter is decreased when the
radii are scaled to r_V.
  The regularity we found in the gas profiles at x>0.2 supports the existence
of an universal underlying dark matter profile. It suggests that non
gravitational heating is negligible for clusters with temperature above
~3.5keV. The very large scatter observed in the core properties favor scenario
where Cooling Flows are periodically erased by merger events. Our results are
consistent with the classical scaling M-T relation. Accordingly the spread in

how these affect power spectrum determinations from galaxy and weak-lensing
surveys. Non-Gaussian effects not only increase the individual error bars
compared to the Gaussian case but, most importantly, lead to non-trivial
cross-correlations between different band-powers. We calculate the
power-spectrum covariance matrix in non-linear perturbation theory (weakly
non-linear regime), in the hierarchical model (strongly non-linear regime), and
from numerical simulations in real and redshift space. We discuss the impact of
these results on parameter estimation from power spectrum measurements and
their dependence on the size of the survey and the choice of band-powers. We
show that the non-Gaussian terms in the covariance matrix become dominant for
scales smaller than the non-linear scale, depending somewhat on power
normalization. Furthermore, we find that cross-correlations mostly deteriorate
the determination of the amplitude of a rescaled power spectrum, whereas its
shape is less affected. In weak lensing surveys the projection tends to reduce
the importance of non-Gaussian effects. Even so, for background galaxies at
redshift z=1, the non-Gaussian contribution rises significantly around l=1000,
and could become comparable to the Gaussian terms depending upon the power
spectrum normalization and cosmology. The projection has another interesting
effect: the ratio between non-Gaussian and Gaussian contributions saturates and
can even decrease at small enough angular scales if the power spectrum of the
3D field falls faster than 1/k^2.

normal state densities of states of sample and/or tip, existence of bandwidth
cutoffs, unequal work functions of tip and sample, and energy-dependent
transmission probability. None of these effects can explain the sign and
temperature dependence of the observed asymmetry. This indicates that the
observed asymmetry reflects an intrinsic property of the superconducting state:
an energy-dependent superconducting gap function with non-zero slope at the
Fermi energy. Such a sloped gap function will also give rise to a
thermoelectric effect in STM experiments, resulting in a $positive$
thermopower. We discuss the feasibility of observing this thermoelectric effect

thermoelectric currents and voltages together with the tunneling spectra as
function of temperature and tip- sample distance would allow for accurate
determination of the slope of the gap function. It is suggested that it would
be very worthwhile to perform these experiments, because the slope of the gap
function reflects a fundamental property of the superconducting state. The
theory of hole superconductivity has predicted the existence of such a slope,

magnetic field $B({\bf r})$. The nature of the transport depends crucially on
both the strength $B_0$ of the random component of $B({\bf r})$ and its mean
value $\bar{B}$. For $\bar{B}=0$, the governing parameter is $\alpha=d/R_0$,
where $d$ is the correlation length of disorder and $R_0$ is the Larmor radius
in the field $B_0$. While for $\alpha\ll 1$ the Drude theory applies, at
$\alpha\gg 1$ most particles drift adiabatically along closed contours and are
localized in the adiabatic approximation. The conductivity is then determined
by a special class of trajectories, the ""snake states"", which percolate by
scattering at the saddle points of $B({\bf r})$ where the adiabaticity of their
motion breaks down. The external field also suppresses the diffusion by
creating a percolation network of drifting cyclotron orbits. This kind of
percolation is due only to a weak violation of the adiabaticity of the
cyclotron rotation, yielding an exponential drop of the conductivity at large
$\bar{B}$. In the regime $\alpha\gg 1$ the crossover between the snake-state
percolation and the percolation of the drift orbits with increasing $\bar{B}$
has the character of a phase transition (localization of snake states) smeared
exponentially weakly by non-adiabatic effects. The ac conductivity also
reflects the dynamical properties of particles moving on the fractal
percolation network. In particular, it has a sharp kink at zero frequency and
falls off exponentially at higher frequencies. We also discuss the nature of
the quantum magnetooscillations. Detailed numerical studies confirm the
analytical findings. The shape of the magnetoresistivity at $\alpha\sim 1$ is

macroscopic population of the quantum mechanical ground state, are a new,
weakly interacting quantum fluid. In most experiments condensates in a single
weak field seeking state are magnetically trapped. These condensates can be
described by a scalar order parameter similar to the spinless superfluid 4He.
Even though alkali atoms have angular momentum, the spin orientation is not a
degree of freedom because spin flips lead to untrapped states and are therefore
a loss process. In contrast, the recently realized optical trap for sodium
condensates confines atoms independently of their spin orientation. This opens
the possibility to study spinor condensates which represent a system with a
vector order parameter instead of a scalar. Here we report a study of the
equilibrium state of spinor condensates in an optical trap. The freedom of spin
orientation leads to the formation of spin domains in an external magnetic
field. The structure of these domains are illustrated in spin domain diagrams.
Combinations of both miscible and immiscible spin components were realized.

"gr-qc/9901025","Marco Spaans","Marco Spaans (Harvard CfA)","On the Topological Nature of Fundamental Interactions",,,,,"gr-qc astro-ph hep-ph hep-th",,"  A thought experiment is proposed to unify quantum mechanics and general
relativity. The central paradigm is that space-time {\it topology} is
ultimately responsible for the Heisenberg uncertaintly principle. It is found
that Plankian space-time exhibits a complicated, but also definite, multiply
connected character. In this framework, an analysis of the interactions in
Nature is presented.
  I. The Universal ground state of the constructed theory derives from the
properties of the topological manifold $Q=2T^3\oplus 3S^1\times S^2$, which has
23 intrinsic degrees of freedom, discrete $Z_3$ and $Z_2\times Z_3$ internal
groups, an SU(5) gauge group, and leads to a U(1) symmetry on a lattice. The
structure of $Q$ provides a unique equation motion for the mass-energy and
particle rest mass wave functions. In its excited state the Universe is
characterized by a lattice of three-tori, $L(T^3)$. The topological
identifications present in this structure, a direct reflection of the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle, provide the boundary conditions for solutions
to the equation of motion, and suggest an interpretation for the conceptually
difficult concept of quantum mechanical entanglement. II. In the second half of
the paper the (observable) properties of $Q$ and $L(T^3)$ are investigated. One
reproduces the standard model, and the theory naturally contains a Higgs field
with possible inflation. The electron and its neutrino are identified as
particle ground states and their masses, together with those of all other known
particles, are predicted. A mass of $m_{\rm H}=131.6$ GeV is found for the
Higgs boson. [Abridged]

atom and the reduced mass of the electron.

Phys","J.Math.Phys. 40 (1999) 1237-1245","10.1063/1.532797",,"quant-ph",,"  We review Bohr's reasoning in the Bohr-Einstein debate on the photon box
experiment. The essential point of his reasoning leads us to an uncertainty
relation between the proper time and the rest mass of the clock. It is shown
that this uncertainty relation can be derived if only we take the fundamental
point of view that the proper time should be included as a dynamic variable in
the Lagrangian describing the system of the clock. Some problems and some
positive aspects of our approach are then discussed.

  regime","11 pages, 3 figures. To be published in Optics Communications",,"10.1016/S0030-4018(98)00658-0",,"quant-ph",,"  We consider the coupling of the electromagnetic vacuum field with an
oscillating perfectly-reflecting mirror in the nonrelativistic approximation.
As a consequence of the frequency modulation associated to the motion of the
mirror, low frequency photons are generated. We calculate the photon emission
rate by following a nonperturbative approach, in which the coupling between the
field sidebands is taken into account. We show that the usual perturbation
theory fails to account correctly for the contribution of TM-polarized vacuum
fluctuations that propagate along directions nearly parallel to the plane
surface of the mirror.
  As a result of the modification of the field eigenfunctions, the resonance
frequency for photon emission is shifted from its unperturbed value.
