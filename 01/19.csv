mass and parent metallicity. Theoretical modelling is based on an improved
scheme for treating the third dredge-up in synthetic calculations of thermally
pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars. In this approach, the usual
criterion (based on a constant minimum core mass for the occurrence of
dredge-up, M_c^min) is replaced by one on the minimum temperature at the base
of the convective envelope, T_b^dred, at the stage of the post-flash luminosity
maximum. Envelope integrations then allow determination of M_c^min as a
function of stellar mass, metallicity, and pulse strength (see Wood 1981), thus
inferring if and when dredge-up first occurs. Moreover, the final possible shut
down of the process is predicted. Extensive grids of TP-AGB models were
computed using this scheme. We present and discuss the calibration of the two
dredge-up parameters (lambda and T_b^dred) aimed at reproducing the carbon star
luminosity function (CSLF) in the LMC. It turns out that the faint tail is
almost insensitive to the history of star formation rate (SFR) in the parent
galaxy (it is essentially determined by T_b^dred), in contrast to the bright
wing which may be more affected by the details of the recent SFR. Once the
faint end is reproduced, the peak location is a stringent calibrator of lambda.
The best fit to the observed CSLF in the LMC is obtained with Z=0.008,
lambda=0.50, log(T_b^dred)=6.4, and a constant SFR up to 5x10^8 yr ago. A good
fit to the CSLF in the SMC is then easily derived from the Z=0.004 models, with
a single choice of parameters, and a constant SFR over the entire significant
age interval. The results are consistent with the theoretical expectation that
the third dredge-up is more efficient at lower Zs.

previously known for individual Seyferts with `linear' radio sources, is here
shown to be characteristic of early-type Seyfert galaxies as a class. Seyfert
2.0's in the early-type sample also show a significant alignment between the
emission-line ([OIII] and Halpha+[NII]) axes and the major axis of the host
galaxy. These alignments are consistent with a picture in which the ionized gas
represents ambient gas predominantly co-planar with the galaxy stellar disk.
This ambient gas is ionized by nuclear radiation that may escape preferentially
along and around the radio axis, and is compressed in shocks driven by the
radio ejecta. We use this alignment to constrain the product of the velocity of
the radio ejecta and the period of any large angle precession of the inner
accretion disk and jet : V_ejecta x P >= 2 kpc. An investigation of a larger
sample of Seyferts reveals the unexpected result that the Seyfert 1's with the

time cannot be reproduced by a simple stellar evolution model defined by a
constant (comoving) star-formation density and a universal (Salpeter) IMF, and
require instead a substantial increase in the stellar birthrate with lookback
time. While the bulk of the stars present today appears to have formed
relatively recently, the existence of a decline in the star-formation density
above z=2 remains uncertain. The history of the transition from the cosmic
`dark age' to a ionized universe populated with luminous sources can constrain
the star formation activity at high redshifts. If stellar sources are
responsible for photoionizing the intergalactic medium at z=5, the rate of star
formation at this epoch must be comparable or greater than the one inferred
from optical observations of galaxies at z=3. A population of dusty, Type II
AGNs at z<2 could make a significant contribution to the FIR background if the

that most interstellar grains rotate suprathermally. Suprathermally rotating
grains would be nearly perfectly aligned with the magnetic field by
paramagnetic dissipation if not for ``crossovers'', intervals of low angular
velocity resulting from reversals of the torques responsible for suprathermal
rotation; during crossovers grains are susceptible to disalignment by random
impulses.
  Lazarian and Draine (1997) identified thermal fluctuations within grain
material as an important component of crossover dynamics. For grains of size
less than 0.1 micron, these fluctuations ensure good correlation of angular
momentum before and after crossover resulting in good alignment, in accord with
observations of starlight polarization. In the present paper we discuss two new
processes which are important for the dynamics of grains with a<0.1 micron. The
first -- ``thermal flipping'' -- offers a way for small grains to bypass the
period of greatly reduced angular momentum which would otherwise take place
during a crossover, thereby enhancing the alignment of small grains. The second
effect -- ``thermal trapping'' -- arises when thermal flipping becomes rapid
enough to prevent the systematic torques from driving the grain to suprathermal
rotation. This effect acts to reduce the alignment of small grains.
  The observed variation of grain alignment with grain size would then result
from a combination of the thermal flipping process -- which suppresses
suprathermal rotation of small grains -- and due to molecular hydrogen
formation and starlight -- which drive large grains to suprathermal rotation
rates.

that a halo of the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter

using the Doppler shift of 21cm emission line. We calculate the emission
spectrum in velocity slices of data (channel maps) and derive its dependence on
the statistics of HI velocity and density fields. We find that (a) if the
density spectrum is steep, i.e. n<-3, the short-wave asymptotics of the
emissivity spectrum is dominated by velocity fluctuations; (b) the velocity
fluctuations make the emission spectra shallower, provided that the data slices
are sufficiently thin. In other words, turbulent velocity creates small scale
structure that can erroneously be identified as clouds. The contribution of
fluctuations in warm HI is suppressed relative to cold component when velocity
channels used are narrower than warm HI thermal velocity and small angular
scale fluctuations are measured. We calculate how emission spectra vary with
the change of velocity slice thickness and show that the observational 21cm
data is consistent with the explanation that intensity fluctuations within
individual channel maps are generated by a turbulent velocity field. As the
thickness of velocity slices increases density fluctuations get to dominate the
emissivity. This allows to disentangle velocity and density statistics.
Application of our technique to the Galactic and SMC data reveals spectra of
density and velocity with the power law index close to -11/3. This is a
Kolmogorov index, but the explanation of the spectrum appealing to the
Kolmogorov-type cascade faces substantial difficulties. We generalize our
treatment for the case of a statistical study of turbulence inside individual
clouds. The mathematical machinery developed is applicable to other emission
lines.

example, we find that minimum values of dark matter core radii scale as r_dm >

radius for a given mass accretion rate, outside of which the optically thin hot
solutions do not exist in the equatorial plane, agrees with one-dimensional
study. However, we find that, even within the critical radius, there always
exists a conical region of the flow, around the pole, which cannot maintain the
assumed high electron temperature, regardless of the mass accretion rate, in
the absence of radiative heating. This could lead to torus-like advection
inflow shape since, in general, the ions too will cool down. We also find that
Compton preheating is generally important and, if the radiative efficiency,
defined as the luminosity output divided by the mass accretion rate times the
velocity of light squared, is above sim 4x10^-3, the polar region of the flow
is preheated above the virial temperature by Compton heating and it may result
in time-dependent behaviour or outflow while accretion continues in the
equatorial plane. Thus, under most relevant circumstances, ADAF solutions may
be expected to be accompanied by polar outflow winds. While preheating
instabilities exist in ADAF, as for spherical flows, the former are to some
extent protected by their characteristically higher densities and higher
cooling rates, which reduce their susceptibility to Compton driven overheating.

to arise from gases, that move in the intergalactic medium, due to tidal
interactions occuring among the compact galaxies in the cluster environment.
The connections between intra-day variable BL Lac-blazars and radio emitting
gamma-ray hosts are also studied. The hosts of gamma-ray bursts, BL Lacs and
quasars are believed to represent different evolutionary phases of a particular
type of galaxy with a ""twisted"" morphology. They mostly occur in star formation
environments and evolve from a galaxy possessing no AGN, but consisting of very
massive young stellar sytems, to galaxies possessing developed AGNs, like in
quasars, whose gas content have been exhausted in giving birth to the stars at
the AGN core. In between these two phases, these galaxies may pass through the
state of the red objects, which contain a new born quasar hidden under
dust.This evolutionary history of the morphologies and the environment, where
GRBs may occur is believed to be related to the process of formation of
galaxies and large scale structures. Moreover, the starbursting peaks at

formation histories are determined from model-fitting analysis, based on

sequence turnoffs are very faint, and it is often necessary to use the more

caused by the interaction of the part of the liquid, which is rigidly connected
with the rotating body and thus represents the comoving detector, with the
""Minkowski"" vacuum outside the body. The emission process is the quantum
tunneling of quasiparticles from the detector to the ergoregion, where the

rotational friction caused by the emission of quasiparticles is estimated for

negligible relative to the largely imaginary average non-flip amplitude phi_+.
We discuss theoretical estimates of r_5, essentially the ratio of phi_5 to
phi_+, based upon extrapolation of low and medium energy Regge phenomenological
results to high energies, models based on a hybrid of perturbative QCD and
non-relativistic quark models, and models based on eikonalization techniques.
We also apply the model-independent methods of analyticity and unitarity.The
preponderence of evidence at available energy indicates that r_5 is small,
probably less than 10%. The best available experimental limit comes from
Fermilab E704:those data indicate that |r_5|<15%. These bounds are important
because rigorous methods allow much larger values. In contradiction to a
widely-held prejudice that r_5 decreases with energy, general principles allow
it to grow as fast as ln(s) asymptotically, and some models show an even faster
growth in the RHIC range. One needs a more precise measurement of r_5 or to
bound it to be smaller than 5% in order to use the classical Coulomb-nuclear
interference technique for RHIC polarimetry. As part of this study, we
demonstrate the surprising result that proton-proton elastic scattering is
self-analysing, in the sense that all the helicity amplitudes can, in
principle, be determined experimentally at small momentum transfer without a

example of such a birational isomorphism is the Abel-Jacobi map relating the
Hilbert scheme of g points on a K3 of degree 2g-2 to an integrable system: the
union of Jacobians of hyperplane sections (curves) of genus g. The main results
are:
  1) We construct a stratified version of a Mukai elementary transformation
modeled after dual pairs of Springer resolutions of nilpotent orbits. It
applies to a holomorphic-symplectic variety M with a stratification where the
first stratum is a P^n bundle, but lower strata are Grassmannian bundles. The
resulting (transformed) symplectic variety W admits a stratification by the
dual Grassmannian bundles.
  2) The group of reflections of the Mukai lattice, which act trivially on the
second cohomology of the K3 surface, acts on moduli spaces of sheaves (with
``minimal'' first Chern class) as birational stratified elementary
transformations.

cohomology rings of a holomorphic-symplectic variety M and its stratified
transform W as the cup product with an algebraic correspondence.

expands hydrodynamically and hadronizes. After hadronization the solution
eventually changes from expansion in local equilibrium to free streaming, as
determined selfconsistently by the interaction rates between the hadrons and
the local expansion rate. We show that in such a scenario the inverse slopes of
the $m_T$-spectra of multiple strange baryons ($\Xi$, $\Omega$) are practically
unaffected by the purely hadronic stage of the reaction, while the flow of
$p$'s and $\Lambda$'s increases. Moreover, we find that the rather ``soft''
transverse expansion at RHIC energies (due to a first-order phase transition)
is not washed out by strong rescattering in the hadronic stage. The earlier
kinetic freeze-out as compared to SPS-energies results in similar inverse
slopes (of the $m_T$-spectra of the hadrons in the final state) at RHIC and SPS

diffusivity and the quantum oscillations of the equilibrium distribution
function in momentum space are considered. It is shown that a smooth diffuse
(Fermi-type) equilibrium distribution function leads to a spurious contribution
to the relaxation time. The residual quantum oscillations of the equilibrium
distribution function eliminates the spurious contribution. It ensures the
disappearance of the gain and loss terms in the collision integral in the
ground state of the system and strongly reduces the internal collisional width
of the isoscalar giant quadrupole resonances.

the framework of the O(N) model. The Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis formalism is
applied to derive gap equations for the masses in the Hartree and large-N
approximations. Renormalization of the gap equations is carried out within the
cut-off and counter-term renormalization schemes. A consistent renormalization
of the gap equations within the cut-off scheme is found to be possible only in
the large-N approximation and for a finite value of the cut-off. On the other
hand, the counter-term scheme allows for a consistent renormalization of both
the large-N and Hartree approximations. In these approximations, the meson
masses at a given nonzero temperature depend in general on the choice of the
cut-off or renormalization scale. As an application, we also discuss the
in-medium on-shell decay widths for sigma mesons and pions at rest.

oscillator functions, the corresponding single particle triaxial eigenstates as
functions of the usual cylindrical coordinates (r, $\theta$, z) are evaluated
on a mesh in r and z to be integrated within Gauss-Hermite and Gauss-Laguerre
approaches and as Fourier decompositions in the angular variable $\theta$.
Using an effective interaction of the Skyrme type, the Hartree-Fock hamiltonian
is also obtained as a Fourier series allowing a two dimensional calculation of
its matrix elements. This particular choice is shown to lead in most cases to
shorter computation times compared to the usual decomposition on triaxial
harmonic oscillator states. We apply this method to the case of the
semi-quantal approach of large amplitude collective motion corresponding to a
generalized routhian formalism and present results in the A=150 superdeformed
region for the coupling of global rotation and intrinsic vortical modes in what
is known after Chandrasekhar as the S-ellipsoid coupling case.

demonstrate that the presented method leads to an improved numerical stability

by providing a self-contained quantum representation of the quasi-classical
world, the appropriate quantum state must track closely all macroscopic
phenomena, and the von Neumann entropy of that quantum state ought to change in
the same direction as the statistical entropy of the macro-world. Since the von
Neumann entropy tends to decrease under successive branchings, the evolution of
an entropy-increasing quasi-classical world is not described by the process of
branchings only: mergings of previously separate histories must also occur. As
a consequence, the number of possible quasi-classical worlds does not have to
grow indefinitely as in the many-world picture.
