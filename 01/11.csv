accretion disc, the spectrum of which extends to MeV energies. Pairs created in
photon-photon collisions outside the disc are blown away by soft radiation
(which dominates the bolometric luminosity of the disc) and form a
semirelativistic outflow. We simulate numerically the conversion of the MeV
radiation into a vertical e+- outflow above a disc-like source. The outflowing
e+- plasma becomes optically thick to Thomson scattering if the compactness of
the gamma-ray source exceeds 30. The scattering by e+- then collimates the bulk
of soft radiation along the disc axis, and the apparent bolometric luminosity
of the disc depends strongly on its inclination to the line of sight. The
anisotropic central emission may account for the lack of Fe K-alpha lines in
the X-ray spectra of bright radio-quiet quasars. The scattering in e+- outflows
may also explain the orientation of optical polarization in non-blazar active
galactic nuclei.

of the solar convection zone a region called the tachocline in which high
radial gradients of the rotation rate occur. The usual linear regularization
methods tend to smooth out any high gradients in the solution, and may not be
appropriate for the study of this zone. In this paper we use, in the
helioseismic context of rotation inversions, regularization methods that have
been developed for edge-preserving regularization in computed imaging. It is
shown from Monte-Carlo simulations that this approach can lead directly to
results similar to those reached by linear inversions which however required
some assumptions on the shape of the transition in order to be deconvolved. The
application of this method to LOWL data leads to a very thin tachocline. From
the discussions on the parameters entering the inversion and the Monte-Carlo
simulations, our conclusion is that the tachocline width is very likely below
0.05R_sun which lowers our previous estimate of 0.05+/- 0.03R_sun obtained from
the same dataset (Corbard et al. 1998).

grains. We present thin film infrared (IR) absorption spectra measured in a
diamond anvil cell for both the alpha- and beta- polymorphs of synthetic SiC

matrix method. We find that our thin film spectra have positions nearly
identical to those obtained previously from finely ground samples in KBr.
Hence, we show that this discrepancy has arisen from inappropriate `KBr

in KBr matrices. We re-fit a sample of carbon star mid-IR spectra, using
laboratory data with no KBr correction applied, and show that beta-SiC grains
fit the observations, while alpha-SiC grains do not. The discrepancy between
meteoritic and astronomical identifications of the SiC-type is therefore
removed. This work shows that the diamond anvil cell thin film method can be
used to produce mineral spectra applicable to cosmic environments without

emission of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Modelling of its flat spectrum
implies considerable absorption in most AGN. Compton down-scattering means that
sources in which the absorption is Compton thick are unlikely to be major
contributors to the background intensity so the observed spectral intensity at
about 30 keV is little affected by photoelectric absorption. Assuming that the
intrinsic photon index of AGN is 2, we then use the 30 keV intensity of the XRB
to infer the absorption-corrected energy density of the background. Soltan's
argument then enables us to convert this to a mean local density in black
holes, assuming an accretion efficiency of 0.1 and a mean AGN redshift of 2.
The result is within a factor of two of that estimated by Haehnelt et al from
the optically-determined black hole masses of Magorrian et al. We conclude that
there is no strong need for any radiatively inefficient mode of accretion for
building the masses of black holes. Furthermore we show that the absorption
model for the XRB implies that about 85 per cent of accretion power in the
Universe is absorbed. This power probably emerges in the infrared bands where
it can be several tens per cent of the recently inferred backgrounds there. The
total power emitted by accretion is then about one fifth that of stars.

a variation of the electronic state of the conduction electron. In the

of scattering and is almost independent of the temperature. It is attributed to
a cancellation between the nearest-neighbor spin correlation, the fermion

linear regime described by a surface resistance varying from 10^-9 Ohm for bulk

increasing amplitude various nonlinear regimes are observed, firstly collective
pinning with diverging energy barriers, secondly in bulk samples above 85 K
hysteretic damping, and finally in thin films exponentially large losses which
can be described by pinning energies vanishing linearly at large currents.

proven that there exists a Killing vector field in a one-sided neighborhood of
the horizon in EKG, E[nA]H, E[M]YMd and EYMH spacetimes. This Killing vector
field is normal to the horizon, moreover, the associated matter fields are also
shown to be invariant with respect to it. The presented results provide

for as a signal of direct Delta S = 1 CP violation. We provide a thorough
updating of the analysis of the three components of the decay: 1) Direct CP
violation, 2) CP violation through the mass matrix and 3) CP-conserving

rate is updated to include recent results on the nonleptonic amplitude. Then we
systematically explore the uncertainties in this method. The CP-conserving
amplitude remains somewhat uncertain, but present indications are such that
there may be a sizable CP-violating asymmetry in the e+, e- energies from the
interference of CP-conserving and CP-violating amplitudes. This may potentially
be useful in determining whether direct CP violation is present. The second
decay, K_L -> pi0 gamma e+e-, which occurs at a higher rate than the
nonradiative process K_L -> pi0 e+e-, can be a background to CP violation
studies using the latter reaction. The leading order chiral loop contribution

  Hyperbolic Dehn Filling Theorem","23 pages, 4 figures, Latex",,,,"math.GT",,"  We give a complete proof of Thurston's celebrated hyperbolic Dehn filling
theorem, following the ideal triangulation approach of Thurston and
Neumann-Zagier. We avoid to assume that a genuine ideal triangulation always
exists, using only a partially flat one, obtained by subdividing an
Epstein-Penner decomposition. This forces us to deal with negatively oriented
tetrahedra. Our analysis of the set of hyperbolic Dehn filling coefficients is
elementary and self-contained. In particular, it does not assume smoothness of
the complete point in the variety of deformations.

with non-negative self-intersection number by using the Donaldson invariants.
These formulas are completely analogous to the ones obtained by Ozsv\'ath and
Szab\'o using the Seiberg-Witten invariants. To prove these relations, we give
a fairly explicit description of the structure of the Fukaya-Floer homology of
a surface times a circle. As an aside, we also relate the Floer homology of a
surface times a circle with the cohomology of some symmetric products of the
surface.

first-order differential equations, which after complex rotation, can easily be
solved numerically. The Jost function can be obtained to any desired accuracy
for all complex momenta of physical interest, including the spectral points
corresponding to bound and resonant states. The method can also be used in the
complex angular-momentum plane to calculate the Regge trajectories. The
effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using the Lennard-Jones (12,6)
potential. The spectral properties of the realistic inter-atomic He4-He4
potentials HFDHE2 and HFD-B of Aziz and collaborators are also investigated.

  field theory","8 pages, no figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The root of the divergence problem in the current quantum field theory seems
to be in the special theory of relativity. Here we propose a modified special
relativity theory by introducing the primed inertial coordinate system, in
addition to the usual inertial coordinate system, for each inertial frame of
reference, assuming the flat structures of gravity-free space and time in the
primed inertial coordinate system and their generalized Finslerian structures
in the usual inertial coordinate system, and combining this assumption with the
two fundamental postulates, (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the
constancy of the one-way speed of light in all inertial frames of reference.
The modified special relativity theory involves two versions of the light
speed, infinite speed c-prime in the primed inertial coordinate system and
finite speed c in the usual inertial coordinate system. The physical principle
is: the c-prime-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate
system plus the transformation from the primed to the usual inertial coordinate
systems. The modified special relativity theory and the quantum mechanics
theory together found a convergent and invariant quantum field theory.

aims at connecting in a consistent physical picture (by the introduction of
some working hypotheses when necessary) the technical work published in several
single articles. The part of our model concerning the purely gravitational
aspects of the weak shielding phenomenon is almost complete; the part
concerning the density distribution of the superconducting carriers in the HTC
disks is still qualitative, also due to the very non-standard character of the
experimental setup. The main points of our analysis are the following: coherent
coupling between gravity and a Bose condensate; induced gravitational
instability and ""runaway"" of the field, with modification of the static
potential; density distribution of the superconducting charge carriers;
energetic balance; effective equations for the field; existence of a threshold
density.
