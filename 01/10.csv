performed to date, encompassing an exposure time of 200 ksec with the PSPC and
1.2 Msec with the HRI. The source counts reach a density of ~1000/deg2 at a
limiting flux of ~1E-15 erg/cm2/s. At this level 70-80% of the 0.5-2 keV X-ray
background is resolved into discrete sources. Because of the excellent HRI
positions, 83 X-ray sources with fluxes (0.5-2 keV) above 1.2E-15 erg/cm2/s
could be optically identified so far utilizing deep optical CCD images, NIR
photometry and Keck spectroscopy. Only 11 sources above this flux limit remain
unidentified. The majority of objects turned out to be active galactic nuclei
(AGN) with minority contributions of clusters of galaxies, stars and some
individual galaxies. These deep pencil beam data together with a number of
shallower ROSAT surveys define the source counts over six orders of magnitude
in flux and provide a unique tool of unprecedented quality to study the
cosmological evolution of AGN, which can easily provide the bulk of the
extragalactic X-ray background and could give an important contribution to the
total background light in the universe.

redshift-space density in terms of the eigenvalues and orientation of the local
Lagrangian deformation tensor. We explore the importance of multiple-streaming
using the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), and compute the average number of
streams in real and redshift-space. It is found that multiple-streaming can be
significant in redshift-space but negligible in real-space, even at moderate
values of the linear fluctuation amplitude ($\sigma < 1$). Moreover, unlike
their real-space counter-parts, redshift-space multiple-streams can flow past
each other with minimal interactions. Such nonlinear redshift-space effects,
which operate even when the real-space density field is quite linear, could
suppress the classic compression of redshift-structures predicted by linear
theory (Kaiser 1987). We also compute using the ZA the probability distribution
function (PDF) of density, as well as $S_3$, in real and redshift-space, and
compare it with the PDF measured from N-body simulations. The role of caustics
in defining the character of the high density tail is examined. It is found
that (non-Lagrangian) smoothing, due to both finite resolution or discreteness
and small-scale velocity dispersions, is very effective in erasing caustic
structures, unless the initial power spectrum is sufficiently truncated.

shocks emission (part of the GRB) and the early afterglow signal. Detection of

the dominant emission arises from the reverse shock. This shock, carries an

the trend that the energies of the electrons giving rise to the synchrotron

well-known dynamical systems like planar oscillators with commensurate

Calogero-Sutherland type models, we also point out a host of other examples
where the present approach can be profitably employed. We further study
Hamiltonians having Laughlin wavefunction as the ground-state and establish
their equivalence to free oscillators. This reveals the underlying linear
$W_{1+\infty}$ symmetry algebra unambiguously and establishes the Laughlin
wavefunction as the highest weight vector of this algebra.
