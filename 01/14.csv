Expressions are presented for observers in both the CMBR and Local Group rest

real space density and velocity fields without resort to iterative or
numerically intensive inverse methods. As a corollary to the inversion of the
density in the Local Group rest frame we present an expression for estimating
the real space velocity dipole from redshift space, allowing one to estimate
the Local Group dipole without full reconstruction of the redshift survey. We
test these results on some simple models and find the reconstruction is very
accurate. A new spherical harmonic representation of the redshift distortion
and its inverse is developed, which simplifies the reconstruction and allows
analytic calculation of the properties of the reconstructed redshift survey. We
use this representation to analyse the uncertainties in the reconstruction of
the density and velocity fields from redshift space, due to only a finite
volume being available. Both sampling and shot-noise variance terms are derived
and we discuss the limits of reconstruction analysis. We compare the
reconstructed velocity field with the true velocity field and show that
reconstruction in the Local Group rest frame is preferable, since this
eliminates the major source of uncertainty from the dipole mode. These results
can be used to transform redshift surveys to real space and may be used as part

observations of the M87 jet taken during 1994-1995. Many knot regions are very
highly polarized ($\sim 40-50%$, approaching the theoretical maximum for
optically thin synchrotron radiation), suggesting highly ordered magnetic
fields. High degrees of polarization are also observed in interknot regions.
  While the optical and radio polarization maps share many similarities, we
observe significant differences between the radio and optical polarized
structures, particularly for bright knots in the inner jet, giving us important
insight into the jet's radial structure. Unlike in the radio, the optical
magnetic field position angle becomes perpendicular to the jet at the upstream
ends of knots HST-1, D, E and F. Moreover, the optical polarization decreases
markedly at the position of the flux maxima in these knots. In contrast, the
magnetic field position angle observed in the radio remains parallel to the jet
in most of these regions, and the decreases in radio polarization are smaller.
More minor differences are seen in other jet regions. Many of the differences
between optical and radio polarimetry results can be explained in terms of a
model whereby shocks occur in the jet interior, where higher-energy electrons
are concentrated and dominate both polarized and unpolarized emissions in the
optical, while the radio maps show strong contributions from lower-energy
electrons in regions with {\bf B} parallel, near the jet surface.

assume the accretion disc is steady-state where its radial temperature profile
goes as T(r) \propto r^{-3/4}, we find an inclination of i = 62.5 +/- 4 deg.
However, the predicted ratio of the disc flux to the total flux in B (the
``disc fraction'') is larger than what is observed (about 0.55 compared to <
0.3). If we use a flatter radial temperature profile of the disc expected for
strongly irradiated discs (T(r) \propto r^{-3/7}), then we find an inclination
of i = 54.6 deg and a disc fraction in B of approximately 0.30. However, in
this case the value of chi^2 is much larger (48.4 with 36 degrees of freedom

using a previous determination of the mass ratio (q = M_c/M_x = 0.34 +/- 0.04)

the mass of the neutron star is M_x = 1.78 +/- 0.23 solar masses and the mass
of the secondary star is M_c = 0.60 +/- 0.13 solar masses. We derive a distance
of d = 7.2 +/- 1.1 kpc, which is significantly smaller than a recent distance
measurement of d = 11.6 +/- 0.3 kpc derived from an observation of a type I

distance to each object cannot be determined by its redshift $z$ only; for $z
\ll 1$ the peculiar velocity field contaminates the true recession velocity of
the Hubble flow, while the true distance for objects at $z < 1$ sensitively
depends on the (unknown and thus assumed) cosmological parameters. This hampers
the effort to understand the true distribution of large-scale structure of the
universe. In addition, all cosmological observations are carried out on a
light-cone, the null hypersurface of an observer at $z=0$. This implies that
their intrinsic properties and clustering statistics should change even within
the survey volume. Therefore a proper comparison taking account of the
light-cone effect is important to extract any cosmological information from

resistor with Rs about 1 kOhm. The Bloch transistor normally consists of two
small Josephson junctions connected in series, which in our case have been
replaced by two superconducting interferometer loops, each with two junctions
in parallel. A capacitively coupled gate is supplied to control the induced
charge of the small intermediate electrode (island) of the transistor. The
measured I-V curves show no hysteresis and correspond to the operation of a
effective Josephson junction at the high-damping and strong-noise limits. The
critical current of the system was found to be close to its nominal value, that
is in accordance with the electromagnetic environment theory. The I-V curves
were modulated by the gate with a period of e and a maximum swing of about 2
/mu_V. Such rather moderate modulation results from the Josephson-to- charging
energies ratio, Ej/Ec about 9, in our sample being far from its optimum value
of 0.3 up to 1.

linear dependencies of the melting field and melting temperature on the

particle scattered by a spherically symmetric relativistic star. We calculate
the energy spectrum and the waveform of gravitational waves for axial modes.
Since metric perturbations in axial modes do not couple to the matter fluid of
the star, emitted waves for a normal neutron star show only one peak in the
spectrum, which corresponds to the orbital frequency at the turning point,
where the gravitational field is strongest. However, for an ultracompact star
(the radius $R \lesssim 3M$), another type of resonant periodic peak appears in
the spectrum. This is just because of an excitation by a scattered particle of
axial quasinormal modes, which were found by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari. This
excitation comes from the existence of the potential minimum inside of a star.
We also find for an ultracompact star many small periodic peaks at the
frequency region beyond the maximum of the potential, which would be due to a
resonance of two waves reflected by two potential barriers (Regge-Wheeler type
and one at the center of the star). Such resonant peaks appear neither for a
normal neutron star nor for a Schwarzschild black hole. Consequently, even if
we analyze the energy spectrum of gravitational waves only for axial modes, it
would be possible to distinguish between an ultracompact star and a normal
neutron star (or a Schwarzschild black hole).

$\sim$ 0.1 eV in a few years. Basing to a large extent on the theoretical work

also for SUSY models (R-parity breaking, sneutrino mass), leptoquarks

sensitivity for Majorana neutrino masses from the present level of at best 0.1

effective theory is intended to describe the long-distance transverse electric
and magnetic fields which are responsible for non-perturbative dynamics. His
effective theory, however, also contains long-wavelength longitudinal electric
fields. We discuss several subtleties in the treatment of longitudinal dynamics
which were not closely examined in Boedeker's original treatment. Somewhat to
our surprise, we find that within its domain of validity Boedeker's effective
theory does correctly describe both longitudinal and transverse fluctuations.
We also show that, as far as the transverse dynamics of interest is concerned,
Boedeker's effective theory could be replaced by a transverse-only theory that
removes the longitudinal dynamics altogether. In the process, we discuss
several interesting aspects of stochastic field theories.

temperature, ADM mass and entropy, we use this geometry to construct general
three-parameter models of non-supersymmetric pure SU(N) Yang-Mills theories in
2+1 dimensions. We calculate glueball masses in the WKB approximation and
obtain closed analytic expressions for generic values of the parameters. We
also determine the masses of Kaluza--Klein states associated with internal
parts of the ten-dimensional metric and investigate the parameter region where
some of these states are decoupled. To leading order in 1/\lambda and 1/N
(where \lambda is the 't Hooft coupling) we find a global U(1)^3 symmetry and
states with masses comparable to glueball masses, which have no counterpart in
the more familiar (finite \lambda, N) Yang-Mills theories.

approach to SU(N) gauge theory, which arise from first order fluctuations of
the associated worldsheet in anti-deSitter space. The gaussian fluctuations
occur around a classical worldsheet configuration resembling an infinite square
well, with the bottom of the well lying at the AdS horizon. The eigenvalues of
the corresponding Laplacian operators can be shown numerically to be very close
to those in flat space. We find that two of the transverse world sheet fields
become massive, which may have implications for the existence of a L{\""u}scher
term in the heavy quark potential. It is also suggested that these massive
degrees of freedom may relate to extrinsic curvature in an effective D=4 string

momentum. Applying this new rule to a scalar particle and to a particle with
spin $ 1/2 $, we analyze the time evolution of the operator $\tau $. In the
former case, the evolution of the proper time perfectly matches several
well-established classical formulae. In the case of the particle with spin 1/2,
our new rule implies that an oscillation appears in the time evolution of the
operator $\tau $. This oscillation is similar to Zitterbewegung which is
well-known in the ordinary Dirac theory. We formulate one physical effect of
this oscillation by considering the interaction with a gravitational field, and
estimate how small it is.
