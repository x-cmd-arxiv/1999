resolves into 6 separate doublets with EWs of 0.07\AA--0.38\AA. The absorption
lines have blueshifts relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy of 380 --
1250 km/s, except for one which has a redshift of 250 km/s, suggesting both
inflow and outflow. The inflowing component may be related to the accretion
flow into the nuclear black hole. All the doublet lines are resolved by the

FWHM \sim 160--290 km/s . We find evidence of partial covering by the narrow
absorption lines. Either (but not both) of the two strongest broad doublets
could be from the same material that produces the X-ray ionized absorber seen

Until recently, however, models describing the solar wind - local interstellar

describe the results of a two-dimensional (2D) simulation of the interaction
between the heliosphere and an interstellar cloud with the same properties as
currently, except that the neutral H density is increased from the present
value of n(H) ~ 0.2 cm^-3 to 10 cm^-3. The mutual interaction of interstellar
neutral hydrogen and plasma is included. The heliospheric cavity is reduced
considerably in size (approximately 10 - 14 AU to the termination shock in the
upstream direction) and is highly dynamical. The interplanetary environment at
the orbit of the Earth changes markedly, with the density of interstellar H
increasing to ~2 cm^-3. The termination shock itself experiences periods where
it disappears, reforms and disappears again. Considerable mixing of the shocked
solar wind and LISM occurs due to Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities at the
nose, driven by ion-neutral friction. Implications for two anomalously high
concentrations of 10Be found in Antarctic ice cores 33 kya and 60 kya, and the
absence of prior similar events, are discussed in terms of density enhancements
in the surrounding interstellar cloud. The calculation presented here supports
past speculation that the galactic environment of the Sun moderates the
interplanetary environment at the orbit of the Earth, and possibly also the

small scatter (17%), providing evidence of regularity in large, X-ray flux

radius R500) is steeper than the self-similar expectation by 4.3sigma. There is
a mild dependence of ICM mass fraction fICM on TX; the clusters with ICM
temperatures below 5keV have a lower mass fraction <fICM>=0.160\pm0.008 than
hotter clusters <fICM>=0.212\pm0.006 (H0=50; 90% conf intervals). Our large,

factor at R500. We use the bias corrected mean fICM within the hotter cluster

discussed in terms of their connection to the efficiency of globular cluster
formation---the mass fraction of star-forming gas that was able to form bound
stellar clusters rather than isolated stars or unbound associations---in galaxy
halos. Observed variations in GCS specific frequencies (S_N=N_gc/L_gal), both
as a function of galactocentric radius in individual systems and globally
between entire galaxies, are reviewed in this light. It is argued that trends
in S_N do not reflect any real variation in the underlying efficiency of
cluster formation; rather, they result from ignoring the hot gas in many large
ellipticals. This claim is checked and confirmed in each of M87, M49, and NGC
1399, for which existing data are combined to show that the volume density
profile of globular clusters, rho_cl, is directly proportional to the sum of
(rho_gas+rho_stars) at large radii. The constant of proportionality is the same
in each case: epsilon=0.0026 +/- 0.0005 in the mean. This is identified with
the globular cluster formation efficiency. The implication that epsilon might
have had a universal value is supported by data on the GCSs of 97 early-type
galaxies, on the GCS of the Milky Way, and on the ongoing formation of open
clusters. These results have specific implications for some issues in GCS and
galaxy formation, and they should serve as a strong constraint on more general
theories of star and cluster formation.

a 100-day interval around periastron, varying on time-scales as short as a day
and peaking at 60 mJy (~100 times the apastron flux density) at 1.4 GHz.
Interpreting the emission as synchrotron radiation, we show that (i) the
observed variations in flux density are too large to be caused by the shock
interaction between the pulsar wind and an isotropic, radiatively driven,
Be-star wind, and (ii) the radio emitting electrons do not originate from the
pulsar wind. We argue instead that the radio electrons originate from the
circumstellar disk of the Be star and are accelerated at two epochs, one before
and one after periastron, when the pulsar passes through the disk. A simple
model incorporating two epochs of impulsive acceleration followed by
synchrotron cooling reproduces the essential features of the radio light curve

formation, needed for estimations of the cosmological PBH mass function, is
found to be $\delta_{\rm c} \approx 0.7$ rather than the generally employed
$\delta_{\rm c} \approx 1/3$, if $\delta$ is defined as $\Delta M/\mh$, the
relative excess mass within the initial horizon volume. In order to study the
accretion onto the newly formed black holes, we use a numerical scheme that
allows us to follow the evolution for long times after formation of the event
horizon. In general, small black holes (compared to the horizon mass at the
onset of the collapse) give rise to a fluid bounce that effectively shuts off
accretion onto the black hole, while large ones do not. In both cases, the
growth of the black hole mass owing to accretion is insignificant. Furthermore,
the scaling of black hole mass with distance from the formation threshold,
known to occur in near-critical gravitational collapse, is demonstrated to

pre-existing adiabatic density fluctuations enter into the cosmological horizon
and recollapse. It has been suggested that PBH formation may be facilitated
when fluctuations enter into the horizon during a strongly first-order phase
transition which proceeds in approximate equilibrium. We employ
general-relativistic hydrodynamics numerical simulations in order to follow the
collapse of density fluctuations during first-order phase transitions. We find
that during late stages of the collapse fluctuations separate into two regimes,
an inner part existing exclusively in the high-energy density phase with energy
density $\epsilon_{\rm h}$, surrounded by an outer part which exists
exclusively in the low-energy density phase with energy density $\epsilon_{\rm
h}-L$, where $L$ is the latent heat of the transition. We confirm that the
fluctuation density threshold $\delta\epsilon /\epsilon$ required for the
formation of PBHs during first-order transitions decreases with increasing $L$
and falls below that for PBH formation during ordinary radiation dominated
epochs. Our results imply that, in case PBHs form at all in the early universe,
their mass spectrum is likely dominated by the approximate horizon masses
during epochs when the universe undergoes phase transitions.

the range of effective temperatures and gravities relevant for Cepheids. The

Cepheids. Unprecedented level of agreement is found between models and
observations. We show that within the range of metallicity for the Galaxy and
the Magellanic Clouds, a change of slope in the period - luminosity (PL)
relationship is predicted at low periods, due to the reduction of the blue loop
during core He burning. The minimum mass undergoing a blue loop and
consequently the critical period at which this change of slope occurs depend on
the metallicity Z and on the convection treatment in the stellar models.
However, besides this change of slope, we do not find any significant effect of
metallicity on period - magnitude relationships from V to K bands, and on
period - color relationships in IR colors. We only find a detectable effect of
$Z$ on $(B-V)$ colors. These results are not affected by uncertainties inherent

investigated and some predictions are made when the mixed solvent approaches

pure mixed solvent is near criticality, addition of a small amount of polymers
shifts the criticality towards either enhanced compatibility or induced phase
separation depending upon the value of the parameter describing the interaction
asymmetry of the solvents with respect to the polymer. The polymer-solvent
effective interaction parameter increases strongly when the solvent mixture
approaches criticality. Accordingly, the apparent excluded volume parameter
decreases and may vanish or even become negative. Consequently, the polymer
undergoes a phase transition from a swollen state to an unperturbed state or
even take a collapsed configuration. The effective potential acting on a test
chain in strong solutions is calculated and the concept of Edwards screening
discussed. Structural properties of ternary mixtures of polymers in mixed

field-theoretic approach, we find that in two dimensions and below the density
decay is altered from the case of purely diffusing reactants. In two-dimensions
the density amplitude is reduced in the presence of weak disorder, yielding the
interesting result that Sinai disorder can cause reactions to occur at an {\it
increased} rate. This is in contrast to the case of long-range correlated
disorder, where it was shown that the reaction becomes sub-diffusion limited.
However, when written in terms of the microscopic diffusion constant it is seen
that increasing the disorder has the effect of reducing the rate of the
reaction. Below two dimensions, the effect of Sinai disorder is much more
severe and the reaction is shown to become sub-diffusion limited. Although
there is no universal amplitude for the time-dependence of the density, it is
universal when expressed in terms of the disorder-averaged diffusion length.
The appropriate amplitude is calculated to one-loop order.

matter produced from strings will overclose the universe if $\eta$ is near the
electroweak symmetry breaking scale. To be consistent with $\Omega_\chi \leq
1$, the mass of the new U(1) gauge boson must be much larger than the Fermi
scale which makes it unobservable in upcoming accelerator experiments. In a

despite having so far been observed only in the decays of neutral kaons has
been recognized as a phenomenon of truly fundamental importance. The KM ansatz
constitutes the minimal implementation of CP violation: without requiring
unknown degrees of freedom it can reproduce the known CP phenomenology in a
nontrivial way. (ii) The physics of beauty hadrons -- in particular their weak
decays -- opens a novel window onto fundamental dynamics: they usher in a new
quark family (presumably the last one); they allow us to determine fundamental
quantities of the Standard Model like the $b$ quark mass and the CKM parameters
$V(cb)$, $V(ub)$, $V(ts)$ and $V(td)$; they exhibit speedy or even rapid $B^0 -
\bar B^0$J oscillations. (iii) Heavy Quark Expansions allow us to treat $B$
decays with an accuracy that would not have been thought possible a mere decade
ago. These three threads are joined together in the following manner: (a) Huge
CP asymmetries are {\em pre}dicted in $B$ decays, which represents a decisive
test of the KM paradigm for CP violation. (b) Some of these predictions are
made with high {\em parametric} reliability, which (c) can be translated into
{\em numerical} precision through the judicious employment of novel theoretical
technologies. (d) Beauty decays thus provide us with a rich and promising field
to search for New Physics and even study some of its salient features. At the
end of it there might quite possibly be a New Paradigm for High Energy Physics.
There will be some other threads woven into this tapistry: electric dipole
moments, and CP violation in other strange and in charm decays.

heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory (HBChPT). It is shown that the
discrepancy at leading order is entirely given by counterterms from the order
p^3 Lagrangian, and that the first subleading corrections are suppressed by two
powers in the HBChPT expansion. These subleading corrections include meson-loop
contributions as well as counterterms from the order p^5 Lagrangian. Some
one-loop contributions are calculated and found to be small. Using the three
discrepancies (pi-N-N, K-N-Lambda and K-N-Sigma) which can be extracted from
existing experimental data, we find that the HBChPT calculation favors the
smaller g(pi-N-N) values obtained in recent partial wave analyses.

five Abelian factors. The symmetry breaking to the standard model is achieved
using vacuum expectation values of a Higgs pair in (4bar,2R)+(4,2R) at a high
scale. One linear combination of the Abelian symmetries is anomalous and is
broken by vacuum expectation values of singlet fields along the flat directions
of the superpotential. All consistent string vacua of the model are completely
classified by solving the corresponding system of F- and D-flatness equations
including non-renormalizable terms up to sixth order. The requirement of
existence of electroweak massless doublets further restricts the
phenomenologically viable vacua. The third generation fermions receive masses
from the tree-level superpotential. Further, a complete calculation of all
non-renormalizable fermion mass terms up to fifth order shows that in certain
string vacua the hierarchy of the fermion families is naturally obtained in the
model as the second and third generation fermions earn their mass from fourth
and fifth order terms. Along certain flat directions it is shown that the ratio
of the SU(4) breaking scale and the reduced Planck mass is equal to the up
quark ratio m_c/m_t at the string scale. An additional prediction of the model,
is the existence of a U(1) symmetry carried by the fields of the hidden sector,
ensuring thus the stability of the lightest hidden state. It is proposed that
the hidden states may account for the invisible matter of the universe.

an isomorphism from C(R,M) to the phase space of the MNLS equation so that the

the Cauchy problem for GNLS and the hierarchy of commuting flows follows from
the correspondence. Direct geometric constructions show the flows are given by
geometric partial differential equations, and the space of conservation laws
has a structure of a non-abelian Poisson group. We also construct a hierarchy
of symplectic structures for GNLS. Under pullback, the known order k symplectic
structures correspond to the order (k-2) symplectic structures that we find.
The shift by two is a surprise, and is due to the fact that the group
