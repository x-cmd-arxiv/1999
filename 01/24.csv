two important galaxies in the cosmological distance ladder -- M31 and M33 --
using detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) and Cepheids. While rare and difficult
to detect, DEBs provide us with the potential to determine these distances with
an accuracy better than 5%. The extensive photometry obtained in order to
detect DEBs provides us with good light curves for the Cepheid variables. These
are essential to the parallel project to derive direct Baade-Wesselink
distances to Cepheids in M31 and M33. For both Cepheids and eclipsing binaries,
the distance estimates will be free of any intermediate steps.
  As a first step in the DIRECT project, between September 1996 and October
1997 we obtained 95 full/partial nights on the F. L. Whipple Observatory 1.2 m
telescope and 36 full nights on the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT 1.3 m telescope to
search for DEBs and new Cepheids in the M31 and M33 galaxies. In this paper,
third in the series, we present the catalog of variable stars, most of them
newly detected, found in the field M31C [(alpha,delta)=(11.10, 41.42) deg,
J2000.0}]. We have found 115 variable stars: 12 eclipsing binaries, 35 Cepheids
and 68 other periodic, possible long period or non-periodic variables. The
catalog of variables, as well as their photometry and finding charts, is
available via anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. The complete set of the CCD
frames is available upon request.

of The HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance Scale which aims to
measure the Hubble constant to 10% accuracy. NGC 4535 was observed over 13
epochs using the F555W filter, and over 9 epochs using the F814W filter. The
HST F555W and F814W data were transformed to the Johnson V and Kron-Cousins I
magnitude systems, respectively. Photometry was performed using two independent
programs, DoPHOT and DAOPHOT II/ALLFRAME.
  Period-luminosity relations in the V and I bands were constructed using 39
high-quality Cepheids present in our set of 50 variable candidates. We obtain a
distance modulus of 31.02+/-0.26 mag, corresponding to a distance of 16.0+/-1.9
Mpc. Our distance estimate is based on values of mu = 18.50 +/- 0.10 mag and
E(V-I) = 0.13 mag for the distance modulus and reddening of the LMC,
respectively.

  Galaxies","6 pages, no figure. The Astrophysical Journal (Letters), in press",,"10.1086/311931",,"astro-ph",,"  We investigate whether or not a supermassive black hole (SMBH) with mass
$\gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$ can be made in the heart of ultraluminous infrared
galaxies (ULIGs) during the course of mergers between/among gas rich galaxies.
(a) If one progenitor galaxy had a seed SMBH with mass of $\sim 10^7 M_\odot$,
this seed SMBH can grow up to $\gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$ due to efficient
Bondi-type gas accretion during the course of merger given a gas density in the
circumnuclear region of $n_H \sim 10^3 cm^{-3}$. (b) Even if there was no
progenitor galaxy with a seed SMBH, star clusters with compact remnants
(neutron stars and/or black holes) produced in the circumnuclear starbursts can
merge into the merger center within a dynamical time scale of $\sim 10^9$ years
to form a SMBH with $\gtrsim 10^8 M_\odot$. Note, however, that the
contribution of compact remnants supplied from hidden star clusters is
necessary to lead to the formation of a SMBH. In conclusion, the ultraluminous
infrared galaxies observed in the local universe can make a SMBH in their
center during the course of merger either by gas accretion onto a seed SMBH or
by dynamical relaxation of compact remnants made in the violent circumnuclear
starbursts. Therefore, it is quite likely that the ULIGs will finally evolve to
optically luminous quasars as suggested by Sanders et al.

B15",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.59.5817",,"cond-mat.mes-hall",,"  Ground-state and excited-state properties of vertically coupled double
quantum dots are studied by exact diagonalization. Magic-number total angular
momenta that minimize the total energy are found to reflect a crossover between
electron configurations dominated by intra-layer correlation and ones dominated
by inter-layer correlation. The position of the crossover is governed by the
strength of the inter-layer electron tunneling and magnetic field. The magic
numbers should have an observable effect on the far infra-red optical
absorption spectrum, since Kohn's theorem does not hold when the confinement
potential is different for two dots. This is indeed confirmed here from a
numerical calculation that includes Landau level mixing. Our results take full
account of the effect of spin degrees of freedom. A key feature is that the
total spin, $S$, of the system and the magic-number angular momentum are
intimately linked because of strong electron correlation. Thus $S$ jumps hand
in hand with the total angular momentum as the magnetic field is varied. One
important consequence of this is that the spin blockade (an inhibition of
single-electron tunneling) should occur in some magnetic field regions because
of a spin selection rule. Owing to the flexibility arising from the presence of
both intra-layer and inter-layer correlations, the spin blockade is easier to
realize in double dots than in single dots.

covariant theories, is discussed. The realizations of scale invariance which
are considered, are in the context of a gravitational theory where the action,
in the first order formalism, is of the form $S = \int L_{1} \Phi d^4x$ + $\int
L_{2}\sqrt{-g}d^4x$ where $\Phi$ is a density built out of degrees of freedom
independent of gravity, which we call the ""measure fields"". For global scale
invariance, a ""dilaton"" $\phi$ has to be introduced, with non-trivial
potentials $V(\phi)$ = $f_{1}e^{\alpha\phi}$ in $L_1$ and $U(\phi)$ =
$f_{2}e^{2\alpha\phi}$ in $L_2$. This leads to non-trivial mass generation and
potential for $\phi$. Mass terms for an arbitrary matter field can appear in a
scale invariant form both in $L_1$ and in $L_2$ where they are coupled to
different exponentials of the field $\phi$. Implications of these results for
cosmology having in mind in particular inflationary scenarios, models of the
late universe and modified gravitational theories are discussed.
