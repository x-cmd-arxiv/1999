stars within and surrounding the cloud core of rho Oph. We have measured
spectral types and continuum veilings and have combined this information with
results from new deep imaging. The IMF peaks at about 0.4 M_sun and slowly
declines to the hydrogen burning limit with a slope of ~-0.5 in logarithmic
units (Salpeter is +1.35). Our lower limits on the numbers of substellar
objects demonstrate that the IMF probably does not fall more steeply below the
hydrogen burning limit, at least down to ~0.02 M_sun. We then make the first
comparison of mass functions of stars and pre-stellar clumps (Motte, Andre, &
Neri) measured in the same region. The similar behavior of the two mass
functions in rho Oph supports the suggestion of Motte et al. and Testi &
Sargent that the stellar mass function in young clusters is a direct product of
the process of cloud fragmentation. After considering the effect of extinction
on the SED classifications of the sample, we find that ~17% of the rho Oph
stars are Class I, implying ~0.1 Myr for the lifetime of this stage. In spectra
separated by two years, we observe simultaneous variability in the Br gamma
emission and K-band continuum veiling for two stars, where the hydrogen
emission is brighter in the more heavily veiled data. This behavior indicates
that the disk may contribute significantly to continuous K-band emission, in
contrast to the proposal that the infalling envelope always dominates. Our
detection of strong 2 micron veiling (r_K=1-4) in several Class II and III
stars, which should have disks but little envelope material, further supports
this proposition.

the low-mass stellar and substellar populations in the young cluster IC 348
(1-10~Myr). Optical spectroscopy has revealed young objects with spectral types
as late as M8.25. The intrinsic J-H and H-K colors of these sources are
dwarf-like, whereas the R-I and I-J colors appear intermediate between the
colors of dwarfs and giants. Furthermore, the spectra from 6500 to 9500 A are
reproduced well with averages of standard dwarf and giant spectra, suggesting
that such averages should be used in the classification of young late-type
sources. An H-R diagram is constructed for the low-mass population in IC 348
(K6-M8). The presumably coeval components of the young quadruple system GG~Tau
(White et al.) and the locus of stars in IC 348 are used as empirical
isochrones to test the theoretical evolutionary models. For the models of
Baraffe et al., an adjustment of the temperature scale to progressively warmer
temperatures at later M types, intermediate between dwarfs and giants, brings
all components of GG~Tau onto the same model isochrone and gives the population
of IC 348 a constant age and age spread as a function of mass. When other
observational constraints are considered, such as the dynamical masses of
GM~Aur, DM~Tau, and GG~Tau~A, the models of Baraffe et al. are the most
consistent with observations of young systems. With compatible temperature
scales, the models of both D'Antona & Mazzitelli and Baraffe et al. suggest
that the hydrogen burning mass limit occurs near M6 at ages of <10 Myr. Thus,
several likely brown dwarfs are discovered in this study of IC 348, with masses
down to ~20-30 M_J.

emission-line polarization in each case is oriented roughly perpendicular to
the jet axis, as expected for the obscuring torus model. NGC 4261 and NGC 315
are known to contain dusty circumnuclear disks, which may be the outer
extensions of the obscuring tori. The detection of polarized broad-line

of the low-luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4395 is polarized at p = 0.67%,

Continuum polarization is detected in other objects, with a median level of p =

total integration time of 4.8 hr. Combining exposures in software allows the
detection of Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) having visual magnitude V < 27.9. Two
new KBOs are discovered. One object having V = 25.5 lies at a probable
heliocentric distance d = 33 AU. The second object at V = 27.2 is located at d
= 44 AU. Both KBOs have diameters of about 50 km, assuming comet-like albedos
of 4%.
  Data from all surveys are pooled to construct the luminosity function from
red magnitude R = 20 to 27. The cumulative number of objects per square degree,
N (< R), is fitted to a power law of the form log_(10) N = 0.52 (R - 23.5).
Differences between power laws reported in the literature are due mainly to
which survey data are incorporated, and not to the method of fitting. The
luminosity function is consistent with a power-law size distribution for
objects having diameters s = 50 to 500 km; dn ~ s^(-q) ds, where the
differential size index q = 3.6 +/- 0.1. The distribution is such that the
smallest objects possess most of the surface area, but the largest bodies
contain the bulk of the mass. Though our inferred size index nearly matches
that derived by Dohnanyi (1969), it is unknown whether catastrophic collisions
are responsible for shaping the size distribution. Implications of the absence

particle (WIMP) dark matter has been proposed to exist. We investigate the
implications of this population on indirect signals in neutrino telescopes (due
to WIMP annihilations in the Earth) for the case when the WIMP is the lightest
neutralino of the MSSM, the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard
model. The velocity distribution and capture rate of this new population is
evaluated and the flux of neutrino-induced muons from the center of the Earth
in neutrino telescopes is calculated. The strength of the signal is very
sensitive to the velocity distribution of the new population. We analytically
estimate this distribution using the approximate conservation of the component
of the WIMP angular momentum orthogonal to the ecliptic plane. The non-linear
problem of combining a fixed capture rate from the standard galactic WIMP
population with one rising linearly with time from the new population to obtain
the present-day annihilation rate in the Earth is also solved analytically. We
show that the effects of the new population can be crucial for masses below
around 150 GeV, where enhancements of the predicted muon flux from the center
of the Earth by up to a factor of 100 compared to previously published
estimates occur. As a result of the new WIMP population, the next generation of
neutrino telescopes should be able to probe a much larger region of parameter
space in the mass range 60-130 GeV.

of a R-symmetry. The baryon asymmetry of the universe is generated through a
primordial leptogenesis. In the `B-L' case, neutrinos are assumed to acquire
degenerate masses equal to about 1.5 eV by coupling to SU(2)_L triplet
superfields, thereby providing the hot dark matter of the universe. In the

ten-dimensional theories, namely type IIA^* and type IIB^*, related to type IIB
and type IIA respectively by a timelike dimensional reduction. In this paper we
explore such dimensional reductions in cases where time is the coordinate of a
non-trivial U(1) fibre bundle. We focus in particular on situations where there
is an odd-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS_{2n+1}, which can be
described as a U(1) bundle over \widetilde{CP}^n, a non-compact version of CP^n

eleven-dimensional supergravity. Applying a timelike Hopf T-duality
transformation to the former provides a new solution of the type IIA^* theory,

solutions provide further examples of ``supersymmetry without supersymmetry.''

and show, that ${\bf M}(n|m)$ is a ``noncommutative graded manifold'' in a
stricter sense: There is a natural body map and the cohomologies of ${\bf
M}(n|m)$ and its body coincide (as in the case of ordinary graded manifolds).

may need physics beyond hadronic nature. We call the need for measurements of
low energy antilambda-proton annihilation cross-section in the modeling of
antilambda to antiproton ratio; large value of this ratio is observed in
central heavy-ion collisions at the AGS and SPS. We speculate the importance of
an excitation function measurement of the ratio.

passing through cold magnetized plasma at equilibrium is studied for arbitrary
values of the ratio of bunch density to plasma density. The analysis is based
on the assumption that the magnetic field is sufficiently strong ($\omega_B\gg
\omega_p$, where $\omega_p$ and $\omega_B$ are the electron plasma and
cyclotron frequences respectively). The periodic and nonperiodic solutions for
the momentum of plasma electrons inside and outside the bunch are analyzed. It
was shown that the presence of strong external magnetic field may increase the
amplitude of wake waves and the maximum transformer ratio, the latter being
reached at densities of bunch lower than that in the absence of magnetic field.
The optimum conditions for obtaining the maximum values of the wake field
amplitude and of the transformer ratio are found.

  which was never publicly announced (was 9905002)",,,,"q-bio.NC",,"  Studies of insect olfactory processing indicate that odors are represented by
rich spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity. These patterns are very
difficult to predict a priori, yet they are stimulus specific and reliable upon
repeated stimulation with the same input. We formulate here a theoretical
framework in which we can interpret these experimental results. We propose a
paradigm of ``dynamic competition'' in which inputs (odors) are represented by
internally competing neural assemblies. Each pattern is the result of dynamical
motion within the network and does not involve a ``winner'' among competing
possibilities. The model produces spatio-temporal patterns with strong
resemblance to those observed experimentally and possesses many of the general
features one desires for pattern classifiers: large information capacity,
reliability, specific responses to specific inputs, and reduced sensitivity to
initial conditions or influence of noise. This form of neural processing may
thus describe the organizational principles of neural information processing in
sensory systems and go well beyond the observations on insect olfactory
processing which motivated its development.
