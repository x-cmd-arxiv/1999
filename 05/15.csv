  accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.03034.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Given the failure of existing models for redshift-space distortions to
provide a highly accurate measure of the beta-parameter, and the ability of
forthcoming surveys to obtain data with very low random errors, it becomes
necessary to develop better models for these distortions. Here we review the
failures of the commonly-used velocity dispersion models and present an
empirical method for extracting beta from the quadrupole statistic that has
little systematic offset over a wide range of beta and cosmologies. This
empirical model is then applied to an ensemble of mock 2dF southern strip
surveys, to illustrate the technique and see how accurately we can recover the
true value of beta. We compare this treatment with the error we expect to find
due only to the finite volume of the survey. We find that non-linear effects
reduce the range of scales over which beta can be fitted, and introduce
covariances between nearby modes in addition to those introduced by the
convolution with the survey window function. The result is that we are only
able to constrain beta to a 1-sigma accuracy of 25% (beta=0.55 +/- 0.14 for the
cosmological model considered). We explore one possible means of reducing this
error, that of cluster collapse, and show that accurate application of this
method can greatly reduce the effect of non-linearities, improving the
determination of beta. We conclude by demonstrating that, when the
contaminating effects of clusters are dealt with, this simple analysis of the
full 2dF survey yields beta=0.55 +/- 0.04. For this model this represents a
determination of beta to an accuracy of 8% and hence an important constraint on
the cosmological density parameter Omega_0.

sources detected in the RIXOS survey, that is nearly complete down to a flux
limit of 3e-14 cgs (0.5-2 keV). We show that for X-ray surveys containing
sources with low count rate spectral slopes estimated using simple hardness
ratios in the ROSAT band can be biased. Instead we analyse three-colour X-ray
data using statistical techniques appropriate to the Poisson regime which
removes the effects of this bias. We have then applied this technique to the
RIXOS survey to study the spectral properties of the sample. For the AGN we
find an average energy index of 1.05+-0.05 with no evidence for spectral
evolution with redshift. Individual AGN are shown to have a range of properties
including soft X-ray excesses and intrinsic absorption. Narrow Emission Line
Galaxies also seem to fit to a power-law spectrum, which may indicate a
non-thermal origin for their X-ray emission. We infer that most of the clusters
in the sample have a bremsstrahlung temperature >3 keV, although some show
evidence for a cooling flow. The stars deviate strongly from a power-law model
but fit to a thermal model. Finally, we have analysed the whole RIXOS sample
containing 1762 sources. We find that the mean spectral slope of the sources
hardens at lower fluxes in agreement with results from other samples. However,
a study of the individual sources demonstrates that the hardening of the mean
is caused by the appearance of a population of very hard sources at the lowest
fluxes. This has implications for the nature of the soft X-ray background.

construct a near minimum variance estimator and Fisher matrix of the

in the radial brightness profile is found in the hard energy band up to 10keV.
This requires a deeper central potential than a King-type one. A double-beta
brightness distribution gives a good account of the data. A deprojected energy
spectrum within a spherical region of radius 30 kpc at the cluster center
indicates that the ICM cannot be isothermal there. Simultaneous fitting of the
three (PSPC, GIS, and SIS) energy spectra extracted from the central 3' region
showed that a two-temperature model that has temperatures of 1.4keV and 4.4keV
and a common metallicity of 1.0 solar with the Galactic absorption gives the
best description to the spectra. A cooling-flow spectral model did not give
satisfactory fit. A 3-dimensional cluster model incorporating the two-phase
picture, the double-beta brightness distribution, and the central metallicity
increase reproduced the overall ASCA and ROSAT data successfully. The derived
spatial distribution of the dark matter deviates from a King-type profile
exhibiting a central excess, which is consistent with the Navvaro-Frenk-White
model. The iron is revealed to be more widely spread than stars, which may have
been caused by energetic supernovae and the motion of the cD galaxy. Since the
derived characteristics of the cool phase including the temperature, angular
extent, gas mass, and metallicity, are on a smooth extension of those of
inter-stellar medium (ISM) of elliptical galaxies, the cool phase can be
regarded as the ISM associated with the cD galaxy. The cool-phase X-ray
emission is presumably sustained by energies dissipated by infalling mass to
the cD galaxy in the course of cluster evolution.

minimizes the Hamiltonian given the conserved particle number,coupled with

inspection of the numerical simulations reveals interesting features of the

variable in a statistical dynamical system can be calculated as higher-order
response functions of the mean history of the variable. The response is to a
``control term'' added as a modification to the master equation for statistical
distributions. The proof of the relations is based upon a variational
characterization of the generating functional of the time-correlations. The
same fluctuation-response relations are preserved within moment-closures for
the statistical dynamical system, when these are constructed via the
variational Rayleigh-Ritz procedure. For the 2-time correlations of the
moment-variables themselves, the fluctuation-response relation is equivalent to
an ``Onsager regression hypothesis'' for the small fluctuations. For
correlations of higher-order, there is a new effect in addition to such linear
propagation of fluctuations present instantaneously: the dynamical generation
of correlations by nonlinear interaction of fluctuations. In general, we
discuss some physical and mathematical aspects of the {\it Ans\""{a}tze}

scalar field vacuum states that have been recognized over the last couple of
decades as a powerful line of reasoning when discussing the highly academic
thermal-like Hawking effect and Unruh effect. An important ingredient in this
framework is the concept of vacuum field noise spectrum by which one can obtain
information about the curvature invariants of classical worldlines
(relativistic classical trajectories). It is argued, in the spirit of the free
fall type universality, that the preferred quantum field vacua with respect to
accelerated worldlines should be chosen in the class of all those possessing
stationary spectra for their quantum fluctuations. For scalar quantum field
vacua there are six stationary cases as shown by Letaw some time ago, these are
reviewed here. However, the non-stationary vacuum noises are not out of reach
and can be processed by a few mathematical methods that are mentioned as well.
Since the information about the kinematical curvature invariants of the
worldlines is of radiometric origin, hints are given on a more useful
application of such an academic formalism to radiation and beam radiometric
standards at high energy accelerators and in astrophysics. The survey ends up
with a quick look to related axiomatic quantum field topics and a few other
recent works

decays of light mesons ($VP\gamma$ and $P \gamma\gamma$) in order to extract
some numerical information of relevance to ChPT: a value for $\Lambda_1=0.20
\pm 0.04$, a quark mass ratio of $\simeq 21.2 \pm 2.4$, and a negligible
departure from the Gell-Mann--Okubo mass formula. The mixing angles are
$\theta_8=-20.40^\circ \pm 0.96^\circ$ and $\theta_0=-0.05^\circ \pm
0.99^\circ$. We also give the values of all decay constants. It is shown that
the common mixing pattern with one mixing angle $\theta_P$ is actually quite
appropriate and algebraically related to the $\eta/\eta'$ mixing pattern
presently preferred by the ChPT community. For instance the traditional
$\theta_P$ is functionally related to the ChPT $\theta_8$ and fulfills
$\theta_P \simeq \theta_8/2$. The vanishing of $\theta_0$, supported by all
data on radiative decays, gives a novel relation between mixing angles and the
violation of nonet symmetry in the pseudoscalar sector. Finally, it is shown
that the interplay of nonet symmetry breaking through U(3) $\ra$ SU(3)$\times$
