data for the remaining three (M81, M87, and NGC 4594) have been substantially
updated compared to previous studies. The nuclear fluxes were carefully
selected so as to avoid contamination by emission from the host galaxy, which
can be substantial for very weak nuclei. The present sample of low-luminosity
nuclei all exhibit SEDs that look markedly different from the canonical
broad-band continuum spectrum of luminous AGNs. The most striking difference is
that the low-luminosity objects lack an ultraviolet excess (the ""big blue
bump""), a feature normally associated with emission from a standard optically
thick, geometrically thin accretion disk. The weakness of the ultraviolet band
leads to an unusually steep optical-ultraviolet continuum shape and a more
pronounced contribution from the X-rays to the ionizing spectrum. It is argued
that the absence of the big blue bump is a property intrinsic to the SEDs and
not an artifact of strong dust extinction. The integrated spectra confirm the
exceptional weakness of the nuclei: the bolometric luminosities range from
2E+41 to 8E+42 erg/s, or 10^-6 to 10-3 times the Eddington rate for the black
hole masses previously reported for these galaxies. (Abridged)

heavy absorption (N_H > 10^24 cm^-2) of a bright component, plus an underlying
faint component which is not attenuated by the variable column and whose flux
is ~10% of that of the unabsorbed bright component. A prominent Fe emission
line at ~6.5 keV is evident during the dips. The absolute line flux outside the
dips is similar to that during the dips, indicating that the line is associated
with the faint component. These results are consistent with a model in which
the bright component is radiation received directly from a compact source while
the faint component may be attributed to scattered radiation. Our results are
also generally consistent with those of Brandt et al., who found that a
partial- covering model could explain ASCA spectra of a low-to-high transition
in Cir X-1. The relative brightness of the two components in our model requires
a column density of ~2*10^23 cm^-2 if the faint component is due to Thomson
scattering in material that mostly surrounds the source. We find that
illumination of such a scattering cloud by the observed direct component would
produce an Fe K-alpha fluorescence flux that is in rough agreement with the
flux of the observed emission line. We also conclude that if the scattering

pass through it. Finally, we discuss simple pictures of the absorbers

that the density field cannot be described by a collection of smooth halos with

objects play an important role (but a mean spherically averaged density profile
may exist). In particular, a possible interpretation is that collapsed objects
can be divided into an infinite hierarchy of smaller objects with increasingly
large densities (these substructures might also be continuously destroyed and
created by the long-range action of gravity). Finally, we present multifractal
models (restricted to non-linear scales) which can describe in a natural way
such non-linear density fields with increasingly large fluctuations at smaller
scales. We relate their properties to the correlation functions and present a
few constraints they are expected to satisfy, using theoretical considerations
as well as constraints from numerical simulations. Thus, the simplest realistic
model is the bifractal model described in Balian & Schaeffer (1989a). Moreover,
we show that it should provide (at least) a very good approximation of the

with an additional coupling to vector bosons. Two types of quantum phase
transition appear to be possible within this approach---the first a
conventional spin-density-wave transition, the second driven by local physics.
For the second type of transition to be realized, the effective impurity model
must have a quantum critical point exhibiting an anomalous local spin
susceptibility. In the second part of the paper, such a critical point is shown
to occur in two variants of the Kondo impurity problem. Finally, we propose an

We consider local mass transport through surface diffusion, focusing on the two
cases of diffusion limited and attachment-detachment limited step kinetics. In
both cases, we describe the decay kinetics in terms of step flow models.
Numerical simulations of the models indicate that in the attachment-detachment
limited case the system undergoes a step bunching instability if the repulsive
interactions between steps are weak. Such an instability does not occur in the
diffusion limited case. In stable cases the height profile, h(r,t), is flat at
radii r<R(t)\sim t^{1/4}. Outside this flat region the height profile obeys the
scaling scenario \partial h/\partial r = {\cal F}(r t^{-1/4}). A scaling ansatz
for the time-dependent profile of the cone yields analytical values for the
scaling exponents and a differential equation for the scaling function. In the
long time limit this equation provides an exact description of the discrete
step dynamics. It admits a family of solutions and the mechanism responsible
for the selection of a unique scaling function is discussed in detail. Finally
we generalize the model and consider permeable steps by allowing direct adatom
hops between neighboring terraces. We argue that step permeability does not
change the scaling behavior of the system, and its only effect is a
renormalization of some of the parameters.

processes in small-x deep inelastic scattering are reviewed. The semiclassical
approach, where a partonic fluctuation of the incoming virtual photon scatters
off a superposition of target colour fields, is used to explain the basic
physical effects. In this approach, diffraction occurs if the emerging partonic
state is in a colour singlet, thus fragmenting independently of the target.
Other approaches, such as the idea of the pomeron structure function and two
gluon exchange calculations, are also discussed in some detail. Particular
attention is paid to the close relation between the semiclassical approach and
the method of diffractive parton distributions, which is linked to the relation
between the target rest frame and the Breit frame point of view. While the main
focus is on diffractive structure functions, basic issues in the diffractive
production of mesons and of other less inclusive final states are also
discussed. Models of the proton colour field, which can be converted into
predictions for diffractive cross sections using the semiclassical approach,
are presented. The concluding overview of recent experimental results is very
brief and mainly serves to illustrate implications of the theoretical methods
presented.

larger than $g^2 T$. Starting from the hard thermal loop effective theory,
which is the result of integrating out the scale $T$, it is shown how to

leading order in $g$, one obtains Vlasov-Boltzmann equations for the soft field

function of the noise and the collision term are explicitly calculated in a

is solved. The resulting effective theory for the soft field modes is described

for a calculation of $\kappa$ on the lattice.

physical gauge choices such as the light-cone entails the emergence of
troublesome poles of the type $(k\cdot n)^{-\alpha}$ in the Feynman integrals,
and these come from the boson field propagator, where $\alpha = 1,2,...$ and
$n^{\mu}$ is the external arbitrary four-vector that defines the gauge proper.
This becomes an additional hurdle to overcome in the computation of Feynman
diagrams, since any graph containing internal boson lines will inevitably
produce integrands with denominators bearing the characteristic gauge-fixing
factor. How one deals with them has been the subject of research for over
decades, and several prescriptions have been suggested and tried in the course
of time, with failures and successes.
  However, a more recent development in this front which applies the negative
dimensional technique to compute light-cone Feynman integrals shows that we can
altogether dispense with prescriptions to perform the calculations. An
additional bonus comes attached to this new technique in that not only it
renders the light-cone prescriptionless, but by the very nature of it, can also
dispense with decomposition formulas or partial fractioning tricks used in the
standard approach to separate pole products of the type $(k\cdot
n)^{-\alpha}[(k-p)\cdot n]^{-\beta}$, $(\beta = 1,2,...)$.
  In this work we demonstrate how all this can be done.

the velocity which would be observed at x, if one were to make a retrodictively
optimal simultaneous measurement of x and p, in the limit as the error in the
measurement of x tends to zero. This explains the tendency of the Bohmian
