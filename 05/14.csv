more than 25 sources with temperatures cooler than the latest M dwarfs. A
comparison with detailed model predictions (Burrows & Sharp) indicates that
these L dwarfs have effective temperatures between ~2000\pm100 K and 1500\pm100

between 10^{-3.5} and 10^{-4.3} L_solar. Those properties, together with the
detection of lithium in one-third of the objects, are consistent with the
majority having substellar masses. The mass function cannot be derived
directly, since only near-infrared photometry and spectral types are available
for most sources, but we can incorporate VLM/brown dwarf models in simulations
of the Solar Neighbourhood population and constrain Psi(M) by comparing the
predicted L-dwarf surface densities and temperature distributions against
observations from the DENIS and 2MASS surveys. The data, although sparse, can
be represented by a power-law mass function, Psi(M) ~ M^{-alpha}, with 1 <

the halos which are favored to host GRBs. If the harboring coefficient $f$ of
GRBs per halo is weakly dependent on the mass of the halo, the redshift data of
GRB OTs can yield significant constraints on the massive halos hosting GRBs. We
show that, in the framework of popular cold dark matter (CDM) models, the
GRB-favored environments are newly collapsed halos (i.e. their ages less than
about $2 \times 10^9$ yr) with masses around $10^9$ $h^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$. In
this scenario, low redshift GRBs, if they exist, could not have the same cosmic
origin as the high redshift ones. To fit with the observed rate of GRBs, we
conclude that each GRB halo can host probably no more than one GRB event on

optically unidentified. The observed X-ray characteristics strongly suggest
that it is a so-called ""Z-source,"" the rare but important category that
includes Sco X-1 and Cyg X-2. Use of the USNO-A2.0 catalog enables us to
measure the position of optical and infrared objects near the radio source to
sub-arcsecond precision within the International Celestial Reference Frame, for
direct comparison with the radio position, which we also recompute using modern
calibrators. With high confidence we eliminate the V~17.5 star NP Ser, often
listed as the probable optical counterpart of the X-ray source, as a candidate.
Our HST NICMOS observations show two faint objects within our 0.5"" radius 90%

than expected (H~19.8), given multiple estimates of the extinction in this
field and our previous understanding of Z sources, but it becomes the best
candidate for the counterpart of GX 17+2. The probability of a chance
coincidence of an unrelated faint object on the radio position is high.
However, if the true counterpart is not Star A, it is fainter still, and our
conclusion that the optical counterpart is surprisingly underluminous is but
strengthened.

3-velocity (V) at the Event Horizon of a Kruskal Black Hole. This has been done
in the backdrop of the recent work by Mitra (astro-ph/9904162) where it was
shown that the radial geodesic of material particle, unphysically, becomes null
at the Event Horizon. Although Tereno stops short of finding the precise value
of V at r=2M, he concludes that V <1. It is pointed out with reference to
Eq.(13) of Tereno's work that since his delta = (r -2M)/r tends to 0 as r tends
to 2M, V indeed tends to 1. It appears that Tereno's conclusion is driven by
his inability to conceive proper limiting value of fractions. Similarly, his
idea that, the velocity addition formula of Sp. Theory of Relativity breaks
down when both the velocities approach unity is due his same inability. In
particular, our central result that Schwarschild BHs must have M=0 has been
obtained independently from three different considerations (gr-qc/9810038,
astro-ph/9904162, 163). And we also offer here the essential physical reason
why the speed of free fall at the Event Horizon must be equal to the speed of
light in coordinate system. Yet we are thankful to Tereno for making the first

shocks using a system of stochastic differential equations (SDE) equivalent to
the Fokker-Planck equation. We compute approximate solutions of the transport
of cosmic particles at shock fronts with a SDE numerical scheme. The momentum
gain is given by implicit calculations of the fluid velocity gradients using a
linear interpolation between two consecutive time steps. We validate our
procedure in the case of single shock acceleration with different shock
thickness, with or without synchrotron losses. A comparative discussion of
implicit and explicit schemes for different shock thickness shows that implicit
calculations extend the range of applicability of SDE schemes to infinitely
thin 1D shocks. The method is then applied to multiple shock acceleration for a
system of identical shocks which free parameters are the distance between two
consecutive shocks, the synchrotron losses time and the escape time of the
particles. The stationary distribution reproduces quite well the flat
differential logarithm energy distribution produced by multiple shock effect,
and also the piling-up effect due synchrotron losses at a momentum where they
equilibrate the acceleration rate. At higher momenta particle losses dominate
and the spectrum drops. The competition between acceleration and loss effects
leads to a pile-up shaped distribution which appears to be effective only in a
restrict range of inter-shock distances of 10-100 diffusion lengths. We finally
compute the optically thin synchrotron spectrum produced such periodic pattern
which can explain flat and/or inverted spectra observed in Flat Radio spectrum
Quasars and in the galactic centre.

for constructing such models for fluid dynamic systems consisting of particles
with arbitrary interaction potentials and existing over arbitrary spatial

simulation of systems of particles moving with unit speed along the links of an
underlying square spatial lattice. Using this model, two two-dimensional

For almost all the model and system parameters, the results are found to be in

normalized). The mean grows like $s_\xi^* \log N$, where $s_\xi^*(p)$ is a
``crossover size''. The standard deviation is bounded near $s_\xi^*
\pi/\sqrt{6}$ with persistent fluctuations due to discreteness. These
predictions are verified by Monte Carlo simulations on $d=2$ square lattices of

shown that the low voltage conductance of this system determined by the Andreev

value is very sensitive to the weak pairing interaction of electrons in the s

phi, between the S and s superconductors. It is shown that if the tunneling

concern of the paper is how the system changes from the SU(4) to the SU(2)
symmetric limit as the magnetic field is increased. For this model the
conformal field theory predicts an usual behavior: there is a jump of the
critical exponents just before the SU(2) limit. For a finite-size system,
however, the orbital-orbital correlation functions approach continuously to the
SU(2) limit after interesting crossover phenomena. The crossover takes place in
the magnetization range of 1/3 $\sim$ 1/2 for the system with 72 sites studied

generalized factorization approach using a recent calculation of the effective
Wilson coefficients $c^{eff}_i$, which are not only renormalization-scale and
-scheme independent but also gauge invariant and infrared finite. After making
a universal ansatz for the nonfactorizable contributions, we parametrize these
effects in terms of $N_c^{eff}(LL)$ and $N_c^{eff}(LR)$, the effective numbers
of colors arising from $(V-A)(V-A)$ and $(V-A)(V+A)$ four-quark operators,
respectively. Three different schemes for these contributions are considered:
(i) the naive factorization, (ii) the large-N_c improved factorization, and
(iii) our preferred choice: $(N_c^{eff}(LL), N_c^{eff}(RR))=(2,5)$. We present
the full angular distribution of all charmless $B_u \to V V$ decays in both
transversity and helicity frames.Direct CP violation in these normalized
angular correlation coefficients is not negligible in $B^-_u \to K^{*-} \rho^0,
K^{*-} \omega$, and direct CP violation in the partial rate difference for
$B^-_u \to K^{*-} \omega, K^{*-} \rho$ and $\rho^- \omega$ can be as large as
45%, 25%, -10%, respectively. Due to the sizable QCD penguin contributions in
$\rho^- \omega$, the determination of the unitary triangle $\alpha$ via this
decay mode is more promising than via $\rho^- \rho^0$. It is also encouraging
to determine the unitary triangle $\gamma$ through $B^-_u \to K^{*-} \rho$
because of $N_c$-insensitivity and the not-so-small tree contribution. The
impacts of a negative $\rho$ on the branching ratios and CP violation are
studied. We also comment on the theoretical uncertainties and their possible

the singular limits of certain modulus parameters, for which the original S^n

solutions to the nonlinear phase modification of the Schr\""{o}dinger equation

of a single particle being influenced by the very presence of other particles.
In the simplest case of identical particles, it is the number of particles that
affects the wave function of each particle and, in particular, the width of its
Gaussian probability density. As a result, this width, a local property, is
directly linked to the mass of the entire Universe in a very Machian manner. In
the realistic limit of large $n$ if the width in question is to be microscopic,
the coupling constant must be very small resulting in an ``almost linear''
theory. This provides a model explanation of why the linearity of quantum
mechanics can be accepted with such a high degree of certainty even if the more
fundamental underlying theory could be nonlinear. We also demonstrate that when
such non-correlated solitons are coupled to harmonic oscilators they lead to a
faster-than-light nonlocal telegraph since changing the frequency of one
oscillator affects instantaneously the probability density of particles
associated with other oscillators. This effect can be alleviated by fine-tuning
the parameters of the solution. Exclusion rules of a novel kind that we term
supersuperselection rules also emerge from these solutions. They are similar to
the mass and the univalence superselection rules in linear quantum mechanics.
The effects in question and the exclusion rules do not appear if a weakly
separable extension to $n$-particles is employed.

detail by the method of quantum molecular dynamics. The distribution function
of the times describing the arrival of a tunneling packet in front of and
behind a barrier and the momentum distribution function of the packet are
calculated. The behavior of the average coordinate of a packet, the average
momentum, and their variances is investigated. It is found that under the
barrier a part of the packet is reflected and a Gaussian barrier increases the
average momentum of the transmitted packet and its variance in momentum space.

operating in entangled configuration is adopted to amplify into a large
dimensionality spin 1/2 Hilbert space the quantum entanglement and
superposition properties of the photon-couples generated by parametric
down-conversion. The structure of the Wigner function and of the field's
correlation functions shows a decoherence-free, multiphoton Schroedinger-cat
behaviour of the emitted field which is largely detectable against the
squeezed-vacuum noise. Furthermore, owing to its entanglement character, the
system is found to exhibit multi-particle quantum nonseparability and Bell-type
nonlocality properties. These relevant quantum features are analyzed for
several travelling-wave optical configurations implying different input
quantum-injection schemes
