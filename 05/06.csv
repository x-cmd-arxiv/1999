absorption and escape of nonionizing photons from a spherically symmetric
two-phase clumpy medium, with either a central point source of isotropic
radiation, a uniform distribution of isotropic emitters, or uniformly
illuminated by external sources. The analytical approximations are based on the
mega-grains model of two-phase clumpy media, as proposed by Hobson & Padman,
combined with escape and absorption probability formulae for homogeneous media.
The accuracy of the approximations is examined by comparison with 3D Monte
Carlo simulations of radiative transfer, including multiple scattering. Our
studies show that the combined mega-grains and escape/absorption probability
formulae provide a good approximation of the escaping and absorbed radiation
fractions for a wide range of parameters characterizing the medium. A realistic
test is performed by modeling the absorption of a starlike source of radiation
by interstellar dust in a clumpy medium, and by calculating the resulting
equilibrium dust temperatures and infrared emission spectrum of both the clumps
and the interclump medium. In particular, we find that the temperature of dust
in clumps is lower than in the interclump medium if clumps are optically thick.
Comparison with Monte Carlo simulations of radiative transfer in the same
environment shows that the analytic model yields a good approximation of dust
temperatures and the emerging UV to FIR spectrum of radiation for all three
types of source distributions mentioned above. Our analytical model provides a
numerically expedient way to estimate radiative transfer in a variety of
interstellar conditions and can be applied to a wide range of astrophysical
environments, from star forming regions to starburst galaxies.

quasar at z=1.019 lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.439. The relatively flat
radio spectra of the lensed images, combined with a previous ROSAT detection of

supernovae have been extensively used for cosmological purpouses, in particular
to estimate extragalactic distances and the Hubble constant. Recently the
number of Type Ia supernovae detected at high redshift has increased, opening
the possibility of determining the mass density parameter, the cosmological
constant and the deceleration parameter. The observed supernovae appear to be
further than expected -even for an empty Universe-, implying a low density
Universe and moreover an accelerating Universe. Among the various
uncertainties, we address the possibility that old supernovae are not equal to
current supernovae. From first principles, an evolution of progenitors with
time is expected. Additionally, some observations show a dependence of the
observed properties on galaxy type and colour. Our aim in this work is to study
the outcome of exploding CO white dwarfs following the evolution of the
progenitor intermediate mass stars with different masses and metallicities.
Once this influence of the progentitor has been determined, the observations
may be corrected. At the present stage of this project we are not able to
quantify this effect properly. One result is clear, that the differences at

as all the evidence for a positive cosmological constant ($\sim$0.25 mag).

have a unique specific entropy. This uniqueness, a priori unknown, should be
reflected in correlations between the parameters describing the mass (light)

1993; Graham & Colless 1997; Prugniel & Simien 1997), we use the Sersic law to
describe the light profile of elliptical galaxies and an analytical
approximation to its three dimensional deprojection. The specific entropy is
calculated supposing that the galaxy behaves as a spherical, isotropic,
one-component system in hydrostatic equilibrium, obeying the ideal gas state
equations. We predict a relation between the 3 parameters of the Sersic,
defining a surface in the parameter space, an `Entropic Plane', by analogy with
the well-known Fundamental Plane. We have analysed elliptical galaxies in Coma
and ABCG 85 clusters and a group of galaxies (associated with NGC 4839). We
show that the galaxies in clusters follow closely a relation predicted by the
constant specific entropy hypothesis with a one-sigma dispersion of 9.5% around
the mean value of the specific entropy. Assuming that the specific entropy is
also the same for galaxies of different clusters, we are able to derive
relative distances between the studied clusters. If the errors are only due to
the determination of the specific entropy (about 10%), then the error in the
relative distance determination should be less than 20% for rich clusters. We
suggest that the unique specific entropy may provide a physical explanation for
the distance indicators based on the Sersic profile put forward by Young &
Currie (1994, 1995) and discussed by Binggeli & Jerjen (1998).

discussion distinguishes between the formation of low-mass stars in relative
isolation and formation in a clustered environment. Evolutionary scenarios and

observational tests are beginning to interact strongly with the theory.
Observers have identified dense cores collapsing to form individual stars or

Stars of both low and high mass form in clustered environments, but massive
stars form almost exclusively in clusters. The theoretical understanding of

ground rules within which theory must operate. The most rich and massive star
clusters form in massive, dense, turbulent cores, which provide models for star

those of binary X-ray sources, Seyfert nuclei or low luminosity AGN, and
bolometric luminosities relatively dominated by their X-ray emission. We
discuss various possible origins for the hard X-ray emission and argue that it
is most likely to be due to accretion onto the central supermassive black
holes, via low-radiative efficiency accretion coupled with strong outflows. In
the case of M87, our detected power-law flux is in good agreement with a
previously-reported measurement from ROSAT High Resolution Imager observations,
which were able to resolve the jet from the nuclear X-ray emission components.
We confirm previous results showing that the use of multiphase models in the
analysis of the ASCA data leads to determinations of approximately solar
emission-weighted metallicities for the X-ray gas in the galaxies. We also

quiescent supermassive black holes. We describe how the broad band spectral
energy distributions of these galaxies, which accrete from their hot gaseous
halos at rates comparable to their Bondi rates, can be explained by
low-radiative efficiency accretion flows in which a significant fraction of the
mass, angular momentum and energy is removed from the flows by winds. The
observed suppression of the synchrotron component in the radio band and the
systematically hard X-ray spectra, which are interpreted as thermal
bremsstrahlung emission, support the conjecture that significant mass outflow
is a natural consequence of systems accreting at low-radiative efficiencies. We
briefly discuss an alternative model for the X-ray emission, namely that it is
due to nonthermal synchrotron-self Compton processes in the accretion flow, or
wind. This appears to require implausibly weak magnetic fields. Emission from a
collimated jet viewed off axis should be distinguishable from the
bremsstrahlung model by variability and thermal line emission studies. We argue
that the difference in radiative efficiency between the nuclei of spiral and
elliptical galaxies arises from the different manner in which interstellar gas
is fed into the nuclei. In ellipticals, matter fed from the hot (slowly
cooling) ISM is likely to be highly magnetized and with low specific angular
momentum, both of which favor low-radiative efficiency accretion solutions and
possibly the formation of the observed jets.

high-velocity central rotation, followed by a broad maximum in the disk and
then by a flat rotation due to the massive halo. Since the central high
velocity and steep rise are common to all massive galaxies, it cannot be due to
non-circular motions. Disk rotation curves of barred galaxies show larger
dispersion than those of normal galaxies which is probably due to non-circular
motions. Interacting galaxies show often perturbed outer rotation curves, while
their central rotation shows no particular peculiarity. Also, central
activities, such as starbursts and AGN, appear to show no particular

formation, is formulated and used to examine the nature of the Galactic halo at
early epochs. In this model, new stars are formed following each supernova
event, thus their abundance pattern is determined by the combination of heavy
elements ejected from the supernova itself and those elements which are already
present in the interstellar gas swept up by the supernova remnant. The end
result is a prediction of large scatter in the abundance ratios among
low-metallicity stars, reflecting a different nucleosynthesis yield for each
Type II supernova with a different progenitor mass. Formation of new stars is
terminated when supernova remnants sweep up too little gas to form shells. We
show from calculations based on the above scenario that (i) the observed [Fe/H]
distribution for the Galactic halo field stars can be reproduced without
effectively decreasing the heavy-element yields from Type II supernovae by some
manipulation required by previous models (e.g., via mass loss from the early
Galaxy, or later mixing with ``pristine'' hydrogen clouds), (ii) the large
observed scatter in the abundance ratio [Eu/Fe] for the most metal-poor stars
can also be reproduced, and (iii) the frequency distribution of stars in the
[Eu/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane can be predicted. Our model suggests that the probability
of identifying essentially metal-free stars (Population III) in the local halo
is around one in 10^{3-4}, provided that star formation in the halo is confined
to individual gas clouds with mass of 10^{6-7} Msun and that the initial mass
function of metal-free stars is not significantly different from the Salpeter

underestimate H_2 column density N(H_2) by factors of 1.5-3.8. This factor is
the ratio of atomic to molecular infrared emissivities, and we show that it can

that the molecular gas has a 60/100 mum color temperature T_d lower than the

dominated by the mean square pressure gradient. Recent experiments by Voth et
al [Phys. Fluids {\bf 10}, 2268 (1998)] indicate that this quantity, when
normalized by the 1941 Kolmogorov value, ${\epsilon}^{3/2}{\nu}^{-1/2}$, is
independent of Reynolds number at high Reynolds number. This is to be
contrasted with direct numerical simulations of Vedula and Yeung [Phys. Fluids

increasing Reynolds number. In this paper we suggest that there is no inherent
conflict between these two results. A large part of the increase seen in DNS is
shown to be associated with finite Reynolds number corrections within the
quasi-Gaussian approximation. The remaining intermittency corrections are
relatively slowly increasing with Reynolds number, and are very sensitive to
subtle cancellations among the longitudinal and transverse contributions to the

universality which is dictated by the gauge interactions and which efficiently
eliminates new dangerous contributions to flavor changing neutral currents.
However, the Higgs potential in this framework typically contains an
unacceptable hierarchy between its dimensionful parameters (the $\mu$-problem
of gauge mediation). We show that the problem can be resolved if the Higgs
potential arises dynamically once an intermediate U(1)' sector is integrated
out rather than arising radiatively from some Yukawa interactions at the
messenger scale. As an added benefit, such models may naturally avoid new
contribution to CP violating amplitudes. The proposed framework is described,
explicit examples are given and its phenomenology is explored. The $\mu$
problem is resolved in this case by the low-energy U(1)' dynamics which could
be tested in future collider experiments.

is studied since it is known that this has an unbounded number of oscillations

care is taken with the numerical method. We demonstrate that similar accuracy
is also achieved using an unstructured finite element solver which may be
applied to problems on domains with arbitrary geometries. A number of results
obtained from this mixed finite element approach are then presented for a

which the oscillatory behaviour is studied as a function of the internal angle,
and another family of (symmetric and non-convex) domains, for which the parity
of the least eigenfunction is investigated. The paper not only verifies

the the surface of the cluster by long range induction and dispersion
interactions with He, but that a large number of `particle in a box' center of
mass states are thermally populated. It is explicitly demonstrated how to
calculate the spectrum that arises from the coupling of the impurity rotation
and the center of mass motion, and it is found that this is a potentially
significant source of inhomogeneous broadening in vibration-rotation spectra of
anisotropic impurities. Another source of inhomogeneous broadening is the
hydrodynamic coupling of the rotation of the impurity with the center of mass
velocity. A quantum hamiltonian to describe this effect is derived from the
classical hydrodynamic kinetic energy of an ellipsoid. Simple analytic
expressions are derived for the resulting spectral line shape for an impurity
in bulk He, and the relevant matrix elements derived to allow fully quantum
calculations of the coupling of the center of mass motion and rotation for an
impurity confined in a spherical He cluster. Lastly, the hydrodynamic
contribution to the impurity effective moment of inertia is evaluated and found

direct numerical simulation (DNS) for plane Poiseuille flow at Re=3000. It is
suggested that there exists a traveling-wave solution (TWS). The TWS is
localized around one of the two walls and notably resemble to the coherent
structures observed in experiments and DNS so far. The phase space structure
around this TWS is similar to a saddle point. Since the stable manifold of this
TWS is extended close to the quasi two dimensional (Q2D) energy axis, the
approaching process toward the TWS along the stable manifold is approximately
described as the instability of the streak (Q2D flow) and the succeeding
nonlinear evolution. Bursting corresponds to the escape from the TWS along the
unstable manifold. These manifolds constitute part of basin boundary of the
turbulent state.

liquid-vapor critical point has been measured as a function of the density.
Near the critical temperature the zero-field density-normalized ion mobility
shows a deep minimum at a density smaller than the critical one. This
phenomenon was previously intepreted as the result of the formation of a
correlated cluster of Argon atoms around the ion because of the strong
electrostriction exerted by the ion on the highly polarizable and compressible
gas. We now suggest that a possible alternative explanation is related to the
onset of a parametric resonance of a bubble surrounding the ion. At resonance a
large amount of energy is dissipated by sound waves in addition to viscous
dissipation processes, resulting in the large mobility drop observed.

possibility to unite a description of corpuscular and wave properties of real
physical objects, i.e. fields and particles. There are substantiated an
approach and a mathematical pattern which give a possibility to describe
physical object not only in causal, but also in absolute remote fields of the
Minkowski space. Applying the proposed approach to the microcosm description,
one can get the equations that in passage to the limit transfer to such quantum
mechanics equations as Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon-Fock and in particular case -
the wave equation. The event nature of the received equations is discussed. It
is shown that all mentioned equations reflect the space-time relativistic
