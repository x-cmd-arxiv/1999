microwave sky at 30 and 40 GHz between l=50 and l=200 over approximately 600
sq. deg. The data support a rise in the angular spectrum to a maximum with
$\delta T_l \approx 85 \mu$K at l=200. We also give a 2-sigma upper limit of
$\delta T_l < 122 \mu$K at l=432 at 144 GHz. These results come from the first
campaign of the Mobile Anisotropy Telescope (MAT) on Cerro Toco, Chile. To
assist in assessing the site, we present plots of the fluctuations in
atmospheric emission at 30 and 144 GHz.

map may be singular and discontinuous, but it will be measure preserving as a
consequence of the recurrence theorem applied to any region of a simpler map.
In the case of a billiard this is the Birkhoff map. The semiclassical
quantization of the Birkhoff map can be subdivided into an entrance and a
repeller. The construction of a scattering operator then follows in exact
analogy to the classical process. Generically, the approximate unitarity of the
semiclassical Birkhoff map is inherited by the S-matrix, even for highly
resonant scattering where direct quantization of the scattering map breaks
down.

bound states of the Hamiltonian, restricted to sections on leads that are
asymptotically independent, far away from the interaction region. The
decomposition is achieved by sectioning this region and adding new leads, thus
generating two new scatterers. So a resonant scatterer, whose $\bS$-matrix has
sharp energy peaks, can be resolved into a pair of scatterers with smooth
energy dependence. The resonant behaviour is concentrated in a spectral
determinant obtained from a dissipative section map. The semiclassical limit of
this theory coincides with the orbit resummation previously proposed by
Georgeot and Prange. A numerical example for a semiseparable scatterer is
investigated, revealing the accurate portrayal of the Wigner time delay by the
spectral determinant.

surface roughness due to some material characteristics of the film growing by
vacuum deposition or sputtering. The essence of the computer simulation in this
case is to account for possible surface migration of atoms just after the
deposition, in connection with binding energy between atoms (as the mechanism
provoking the diffusion) and/or diffusion energy barrier. The interplay of
these two factors leads to different morphologies of the growing surfaces from
flat and smooth ones, to rough and spiky ones. In this paper we extended our
earlier calculation by applying some extra diffusion barrier at the edges of
terrace-like structures, known as Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. It is
experimentally observed that atoms avoid descending when the terrace edge is
approach and these barriers mimic this tendency. Results of our Monte Carlo
computer simulations are discussed in terms of surface roughness, and compared
with other model calculations and some experiments from literature. The power
law of the surface roughness $\sigma$ against film thickness $t$ was confirmed.
The nonzero minimum value of the growth exponent $\beta$ near 0.2 was obtained
which is due to the limited range of the surface diffusion and the
Ehrlich-Schwoebel barrier. Observations for different diffusion range are also
discussed. The results are also confronted with some deterministic growth
models.

similar 3.5 Post-Newtonian approach proposed by Blanchet (1993, 1997). Firstly
we concentrate only on the radiation-reaction effects produced by a
time-varying mass-current quadrupole $S_{ij}$. Secondly, we adopt a gauge in
which the radiation-reaction force densities depend on the fourth time
derivative of $S_{ij}$, rather than on the fifth, as in Blanchet's approach.
This difference makes our formalism particularly well-suited to numerical
implementation and could prove useful in performing fully numerical simulations
of the recently discovered $r$-mode instability for rotating neutron stars
subject to axial perturbations.

there is a convenient renormalization scale $\tilde{Q}^*$ at which the loop
expansion respects the perturbation series hierarchy and the theory retains the
vital property of stability.

other hand, neither has quantum gravity yielded the desired results, nor can
String Theory be taken as the last word. We briefly examine this scenario, and
in this light consider the recent description of Fermions in terms of the
Kerr-Newman metric and the related model of Fluctuational Cosmology. All this
is not only consistent with known physics including the latest results alluded
to, but also explains hitherto inexplicable empirical facts like the handedness
of the Neutrino or the large number relations of Cosmology and so on. It is
shown that this scheme leads to a unified description of the fundamental
interactions. At the same time, pleasingly, we recover the usual quark picture
at the Compton wavelength scale and the Big Bang scenario at the Planck scale.
