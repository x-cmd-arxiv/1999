  Revised to incorporate referee's suggestions and numerical simulations. To be
  published in ApJ (2000)",,"10.1086/308902",,"astro-ph",,"  The weak distortions produced by gravitational lensing in the images of
background galaxies provide a method to measure directly the distribution of
mass in the universe. However this technique requires high precision
measurements of the lensing shear and cautious corrections for systematic
effects. Kaiser, Squires, & Broadhurst (1995) proposed a method to calibrate
the ellipticity-shear relation in the presence of Point Spread Function (PSF)
anisotropies and camera distortions. We revisit the KSB method and show that
both the PSF and the camera distortions can be corrected for using source
moments, as opposed to ellipticities. We clarify the applicability of some of
the approximations made in this method. We derive expressions for the
corrections which only involve the galaxy moments. We derive an explicit
relation between the shear and the average ellipticity. We discuss the
shortcomings of the method, and test its validity using numerical simulations.
As an application of the method, we repeat the analysis of the HST WFPC2 camera
performed by Hoekstra et al. (1998). We confirm the presence of sizable (10%)
PSF ellipticities at the edge of the WFPC2 chips. We also show that the PSF
ellipticity varies by as much as 2% over time. We use these measurements to
correct the shape of galaxies in the HST Survey Strip (``Groth'' Strip). By
considering the dependence of the ellipticities on object size, we show that,
after corrections, the residual systematic uncertainty for galaxies with radii
greater than 0.15 arcsec, is about 0.4%, when averaged over each chip. We
discuss how these results provide good prospects for measuring weak lensing by
large-scale structure with deep HST surveys.

driven by an accretion-powered dynamo at the center. These photons ionize the
surrounding gas, thereby providing clues to fueling and exhaust. Two sets of
important relationships - neither of them understood - link the continuum and
gas properties. (i) Boroson & Green's `eigenvector 1' relationships: Steeper
soft X-ray spectra are clearly related to narrower Hbeta emission and stronger
optical Fe II emission from the BLR, and weaker [O III] 5007 from the NLR. We
show that these relationships extend to UV spectra: narrower C III] 1909,
stronger low ionization lines, larger Si III] 1892/C III] 1909 (a density
indicator), weaker C IV 1549 but stronger higher-ionization N V 1240. We
speculate that high accretion rates are linked to high columns of dense (1e10 -
1e11 cm-3), nitrogen-enhanced, low-ionization gas from nuclear starbursts.
Linewidth, inverse Fe II-[O III] and inverse Fe II-C IV relationships hint at
the geometrical arrangement of this gas. (ii) The Baldwin effect (inverse
equivalent width - luminosity relationships): Our correlation analyses suggest
that these are independent of the above eigenvector 1 relationships. The
eigenvector 1 relationships can therefore be used in future work, to reduce
scatter in the Baldwin relationships, perhaps fulfilling the dream of using the
Baldwin effect for cosmological studies.

which characterize broad absorption line quasars (BALQs) occur exclusively in
radio-quiet quasars (RQQs) suggests that this class of active galactic nuclei
(AGN) may offer important clues to the radio-loud/radio-quiet (RL/RQ) dichotomy
in quasars. Interestingly, there is also substantial observational evidence for
similar, but lower velocity intrinsic absorption outflows in some Seyferts and
radio-loud quasars (RLQs) as well. Theoretically, however, it is difficult to
interpret this broad range of mass ejection phenomena in the context of the
standard model for BALQs. Thus, a new model is considered here in which the
thermal gas producing the blueshifted absorption troughs is associated with a
poorly collimated outflow of weakly radio-emitting plasma -- in essence, a weak
jet. This model provides an appropriate framework not only for assessing the
possible connection between the BAL phenomenon in RQQs and related intrinsic
absorption outflows in stronger radio sources and in less luminous sources,
both of which are known to possess jet-like radio structure, but also for
understanding the RL/RQ dichotomy in light of recent observations which
indicate that at least some RQQs possess central engines that are capable of
producing weak versions of the powerful radio jets characteristic of RLQs.

geometrical description of clusters, the accuracy to which such distance
measurements can be made depends on how well one can describe intrinsic cluster
shapes. Using the observed X-ray isophotal axial ratio distribution for a
sample of galaxy clusters, we discuss intrinsic cluster shapes and, in
particular, if clusters can be described by axisymmetric models, such as oblate
and prolate ellipsoids. These models are currently favored when determining the
SZ/X-ray Hubble constant. We show that the current observational data on the
asphericity of galaxy clusters suggest that clusters are more consistent with a
prolate rather than an oblate distribution. We address the possibility that
clusters are intrinsically triaxial by viewing triaxial ellipsoids at random
angles with the intrinsic axial ratios following an isotropic Gaussian
distribution. We discuss implications of our results on current attempts at
measuring the Hubble constant using galaxy clusters and suggest that an
unbiased estimate of the Hubble constant, not fundamentally limited by
projection effects, would eventually be possible with the SZ/X-ray method.

within galaxy clusters, however, there are large uncertainties, dominated by
observational errors, associated with these relations. Using the Delta T_SZ-L

with the off-center brightness peak, P1. This +/- 60 km/s feature is
distinguished by a local velocity maximum centered on P1 and a local minimum
approxmately 0.08"" closer to P2. If the M31 double nucleus is an eccentric disk
with an off-center density concentration, as suggested by Tremaine, then the
self-gravity of the disk can produce just such a disturbance. The expected
kinematic signature is calculated approximately by examining sequences of
closed periodic orbits in a Kepler potential perturbed by a model disk
potential that precesses at constant frequency. The perturbation forces a steep
negative eccentricity gradient in the sequence of closed orbits through the
densest part of the disk, which reverses the arrangement of periapsis and
apoapsis with respect to the central mass. Stars making up the inner part of
the density concentration are at apoapsis, while stars making up the outer part
are at periapsis, producing a steep local velocity gradient. This result is
independent of the details of the mass distribution. The projected rotation
curve of the model is shown to closely resemble that of M31, giving strong
support to the eccentric disk picture.

interacting electronic systems. In this method, the total Hamiltonian (system +
system-pump interaction) is transformed into a different form that (apparently)
does not have a system-pump interaction. The transformed Hamiltonian, which we
call the pump built-in Hamiltonian, has parameters that depend on the strength
of the pump beam. Using the pump built-in Hamiltonian, we can calculate
nonlinear responses (responses to probe beams as a function of the pump beam)
by applying the {\em linear} response theory. We demonstrate the basic idea of
this new method by applying it to a one-dimensional, two-band model, in the
case the pump excitation is virtual (coherent excitation). We find that the
exponent of the Fermi edge singularity varies with the pump intensity.

Emphasis is made on the analysis of the perturbative study of the theory and
its connection to the theory of Vassiliev invariants. It is described how the
study of the quantum field theory for three different gauge fixings leads to
three different representations for Vassiliev invariants. Two of these gauge
fixings lead to well known representations: the covariant Landau gauge
corresponds to the configuration space integrals while the non-covariant
light-cone gauge to the Kontsevich integral. The progress made in the analysis
of the third gauge fixing, the non-covariant temporal gauge, is described in
detail. In this case one obtains combinatorial expressions, instead of integral
ones, for Vassiliev invariants. The approach based on this last gauge fixing
seems very promising to obtain a full combinatorial formula. We collect the
combinatorial expressions for all the Vassiliev invariants up to order four
