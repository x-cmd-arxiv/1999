cover more than 50% of the southern sample with all but two of the 29 objects
detected above our limit of 0.15 mJy. Combining these data with data available

further expands the radio observations of a distance limited sample by 22%.

upon and are consistent with earlier studies. We confirm a correlation between
the size of the radio structure and the radio luminosity. A comparison between

There is no statistically significant difference in radio power between types 1

to learn the structure of the language. Unfortunately, the cost of building
large annotated corpora is prohibitively expensive. This work aims to improve
the induction strategy when there are few labels in the training data. We show
that the most informative linguistic constituents are the higher nodes in the
parse trees, typically denoting complex noun phrases and sentential clauses.
They account for only 20% of all constituents. For inducing grammars from
sparsely labeled training data (e.g., only higher-level constituent labels), we
propose an adaptation strategy, which produces grammars that parse almost as
well as grammars induced from fully labeled corpora. Our results suggest that
for a partial parser to replace human annotators, it must be able to
automatically extract higher-level constituents rather than base noun phrases.

horizon and a divergent Kretschmann singularity at the origin of the

have been sought to see if the singularities can develop from an initially
singular free space-time. In flat space-time the Klein-Gordon equation
$\Box\ph=0$ has the non-static spherically symmetric solution $\ph=\si(v)/r$,
where $\si(v)$ is a once differentiable function of the null coordinate $v$. In
particular the function $\si(v)$ can be taken to be initially zero and then
grow, thus producing a singularity in the scalar field. A similar situation
occurs when the scalar field is coupled to gravity via Einstein's equations;
the solution also develops a divergent Kretschmann invariant singularity, but
it has no overall energy. To overcome this Bekenstein's theorems are applied to
give two corresponding conformally coupled solutions. One of these has positive
ADM mass and has the properties: i) it develops a Kretschmann invariant
singularity, ii)it has no event horizon, iii)it has a well-defined source,
iv)it has well-defined junction condition to Minkowski space-time, v)it is
asymptotically flat with positive overall energy. This paper presents this
solution and several other non-static scalar solutions. The properties of these
solutions which are studied are limited to the following three: i)whether the
solution can be joined to Minkowski space-time, ii)whether the solution is
asymptotically flat, iii)and if so what the solutions' Bondi and ADM masses

rotating objects. On the basis of the No-Hair principle for black holes, they
speculate that this bound cannot be improved generically based on knowledge of
other ``quantum numbers'', e.g. baryon number, which may be borne by the
object. Here we take a first step in the proof of this conjecture. The proof
make use of a gedanken experiment in which a massive object endowed with a
scalar charge is lowered adiabatically towards a Schwarzschild's black hole and
than dropped into the black hole from some proper distance above the horizon.
Central to the proof is the intriguing fact that the self-energy of the
particle receives no contribution from the scalar charge. Thus the energy with
which the object is assimilated consists of its gravitational energy alone.
This of course agrees with the No-scalar-Hair principle for black holes: after
the object is assimilated into the black hole, any knowledge of the scalar
field properties is lost. Using the GSL, we reach the conclusion that the
original entropy bound was not improved by the knowledge of the scalar charge.
At the end we speculate on whether or not massive vector fields may serve in
the tightening of the entropy bound.

on a brane propagating in large extra dimensions. Branes may be stabilized at
large (sub-millimeter) distances from each other, either due to weak Van der

hierarchy scenario. In particular, this infrared stabilization may be
responsible for a large size of extra dimensions. In either case, thermal
effects can drive a brief period of the late inflation necessary to avoid the
problems with high reheating temperature and the stable unwanted relics. The
main reason is that the branes which repel each other at zero temperature can
be temporarily glued together by thermal effects. It is crucial that the
temperature needed to stabilize branes on top of each other can be much smaller
than the potential energy of the bound-state, which drives inflation. After
10-15 $e$-foldings bound-states cool below the critical temperature and decay
ending inflation. The parallel brane worlds get separated at this stage and
superstrings (of a sub-millimeter size) get stretched between them. These
strings can have the right density in order to serve as a superheavy dark

lattice of lower semicontinuous traces are shown to be outer conjugate if they
act in the same way on the K-group and the extremal traces are scaled by
numbers which are not equal to 1 and satisfy a certain condition (which always
holds if all the scaling factors are less than 1). The proof goes via the
Rohlin property. As an application we consider the problem of classifying
conjugacy or outer conjugacy classes of certain actions of the circle group on
a separable purely infinite C*-algebra.

implementation of canonical transformations within wave mechanics, non-trivial
canonical transformations which leave invariant the form of the Hamilton
function of the classical analogue of a quantum system manifest themselves in
an integral equation for its stationary state eigenfunctions. We restrict
ourselves to that subclass of these dynamical symmetries for which the
corresponding effective generating functions are necessaarily free of quantum
corrections. We demonstrate that infinite families of such transformations
exist for a variety of familiar conservative systems of one degree of freedom.
We show how the geometry of the canonical transformations and the symmetry of
the effective generating function can be exploited to pin down the precise form
of the integral equations for stationary state eigenfunctions. We recover
several integral equations found in the literature on standard special
functions of mathematical physics. We end with a brief discussion (relevant to
string theory) of the generalization to scalar field theories in 1+1
dimensions.
