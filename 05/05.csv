mJy/beam area) in total intensity and is limited by confusion. A sensitivity of
8 mK TB is obtained in linear polarization. The angular resolution of the
observations is 9.35 arcminute. The maps in total intensity and linear
polarization have been absolutely calibrated by low resolution data where
available. Significant linear polarization is seen in all the maps. In general,
the intensity fluctuations measured in linear polarization are not correlated

these massive stars approach their Eddington limits. When this happens, they
must reach a point where the centrifugal force and the radiative acceleration
cancel out gravity at the equator. We call this the Omega-limit. When stars are
close to the Omega-limit, strong non-spherical mass loss should occur. This
suggests a scenario where a slow and very dense wind, strongly confined to the
equatorial plane, is followed by a fast and almost spherical wind. We compute
two-dimensional hydrodynamic models of the evolution of the nebula formed from
such interacting winds, using parameters consistent with the outburst of eta
Carinae in the last century. This outburst gave birth to the Homunculus, the
hourglass-shaped inner part of a highly structured circumstellar nebula.
Assuming the star was very close to the Omega-limit during outburst, our models
produce gas distributions that strongly resemble the Homunculus on large and
small scale. This supports the general conjecture that giant outbursts in LBVs
occur when they approach the Eddington limit. Our models constrains the average
mass loss rate since the outburst to values smaller than the present-day mass
loss rate and suggest that eta Car is approaching another outburst. Our models
imply that the occurrence of giant LBV outbursts depends on the initial stellar
rotation rate, and that the initial angular momentum is as important to the
evolution of very massive stars as their initial mass or metallicity.

including simple phenomenological models for evolution in the analysis. The
result is that cosmological models and evolution are highly degenerate with one
another, so that the incorporation of even very simple models for evolution
makes it virtually impossible to pin down the values of $\Omega_M$ and
$\Omega_\Lambda$, the density parameters for nonrelativistic matter and for the
cosmological constant, respectively. Moreover, we show that if SNe Ia evolve
with time, but evolution is neglected in analyzing data, then, given enough SNe
Ia, the analysis hones in on values of $\Omega_M$ and $\Omega_\Lambda$ which
are incorrect. Using Bayesian methods, we show that the probability that the
cosmological constant is nonzero (rather than zero) is unchanged by the SNe Ia
data when one accounts for the possibility of evolution, provided that we do
not discriminate among open, closed and flat cosmologies a priori. The case for
nonzero cosmological constant is stronger if the Universe is presumed to be
flat, but still depends sensitively on the degree to which the peak
luminosities of SNe Ia evolve as a function of redshift. The estimated value of
$H_0$, however, is only negligibly affected by accounting for possible

determine that the relatively weak UV field illuminating NGC 1333 is the
primary cause of the difference. Further, we find that the density of the

cm^-3. NGC 2068 has molecular hydrogen line ratios more similar to those of NGC
7023 and NGC 2023. Our model fits to this nebula show that the bright,
H_2-emitting material may have a density as high as n ~ 10^5 cm^-3, similar to
what we find for NGC 2023 and NGC 7023. Our spectra of NGC 2023 and NGC 7023
show significant changes in both the near-infrared continuum and H_2 intensity
along the slit and offsets between the peaks of the H_2 and continuum emission.
We find that these brightness changes may correspond to real changes in the
density and temperatures of the emitting region, although uncertainties in the
total column of emitting material along a given line of sight complicates the
interpretation. The spatial difference in the peak of the H_2 and near-infrared
continuum peaks in NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 shows that the near-infrared continuum
is due to a material which can survive closer to the star than H_2 can.

significant acceleration of SN ejecta material (even with a preferential
acceleration of ejecta grain material). Current CRs must result mainly from the
acceleration of ISM (""solar mix"") and circumstellar (22Ne- and 12C-rich WR
wind) gas and grain material. The CR source composition, indeed, shows no
anomaly related to SN nucleosynthesis: (i) The CR source FeNi/MgSiCa ratios
have precisely solar mix values, while FeNi are mainly synthesized in SN Ia's,
and MgSiCa in SN II's. If CR's originate in SN ejecta, this requires tight
conditions on the acceleration efficiencies of the various SN Ia's and SN II's.
(ii) The non-deficiency of the main-s-process elements, not made in any SN,
relative to all elements made in SNae. (iii) All CR source isotope ratios are
consistent with solar mix (except for the 22Ne and 12C excesses, WR wind). (iv)
The absence of 59Ni in CRs implies that the time delay between the SN
nucleosynthesis and their acceleration is > 10^5 yr. (v) The physics of SNR's
and of CR shock acceleration implies that the acceleration of interior ejecta
material is comparatively insignificant (Ellison & Meyer, this volume).
Predominant acceleration of current CRs out of superbubble material also seems
implausible. These conclusions regarding current CRs do not necessarily
conflict with the linear evolution of Be/H in the early Galaxy. With the near
absence of heavy elements in the early Galactic ISM, indeed, the acceleration
of even a minute amount of freshly processed material must have then played a
dominant role for the generation of Be from C and O. The ""Be indicator"" is
blind to a possibly dominant early Galactic CR component originating in the ISM
then composed of virtually pure H and He.

ejecta scenarios that have been proposed thus far have serious flaws, and are
unable to account for known properties of present day cosmic rays. These flaws
include: (1) the small fraction of ejecta to ISM mass processed by the forward
supernova remnant (SNR) shock; (2) the difficulty fresh ejecta grains have in
reaching the forward shock in isolated SNRs, and the small expected sputtering
yield, especially ahead of the shock, even if grains do reach the forward
shock; (3) the implausibility that fresh ejecta material can dominate cosmic
ray production in diffuse superbubbles; and (4) the lack of a connection in
fresh ejecta models between the production of cosmic ray refractory and
volatile elements. We conclude that the near linear increase in Be abundance

have between 1 and 5 periods ranging from 0.4 to 3 days with photometric
amplitudes up to 0.1 in Johnson V. The mechanism for these observed variations

stars exhibit variability on a time scale that is an order of magnitude slower
than Delta Scuti stars. They may offer additional insight into stellar physics
when they are better understood (e.g., they may represent the cool portion of
an ""iron opacity instability strip"" currently formed by the Beta Cephei stars,
the SPB stars, and the subdwarf B stars; they may also offer insight into the

stationary. We have investigated the stationarity of 21-electrode multivariate
EEG data recorded from ten patients during generalized tonic-clonic (GTC)

by calculating probability density functions (pdfs) and power spectra over
small equal-length non-overlapping time windows and then by studying visually
and quantitatively the evolution of these quantities over the duration of the
seizures. Our analysis shows that most of the seizures had time intervals of at
least a few seconds that were statistically stationary by several criteria and
simultaneously for different electrodes, and that some leads were delayed in
manifesting the statistical changes associated with seizure onset evident in
other leads. The stationarity across electrodes was further examined by
studying redundancy of the EEG leads and how that redundancy evolved over the
course of the GTC seizures. Using several different measures, we found a
substantial redundancy which suggests that fewer than 21 electrodes will likely
suffice for extracting dynamical and clinical insights. The redundancy analysis
also demonstrates for the first time posterior-to-anterior time delays in the
mid-ictal region of GTC seizures, which suggests the existence of propagating
waves. The implications of these results are discussed for understanding GTC
seizures and ECT treatment.

inhomogeneous saddle points of the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson functional. We derive
an effective theory that takes into account small fluctuations around all of
these saddle points. The resulting free energy functional contains a new term
in addition to those obtained within the conventional perturbative approach,
and it comprises what would be considered non-perturbative effects within the
latter. A renormalization group analysis shows that in the case of
antiferromagnets, the previously found critical fixed point is unstable with
respect to this new term, and that no stable critical fixed point exists at
one-loop order. This is contrasted with the case of itinerant ferromagnets,
where we find that the previously found critical behavior is unaffected by the
rare regions due to an effective long-ranged interaction between the order
parameter fluctuations.

weakly linked Bose-Einstein condensates. The goals are: 1) to investigate
dynamical regimes at the borderline between the classical and quantum behaviour
of the bosonic field; 2) to search for new macroscopic quantum coherence
phenomena not observable with other superfluid/superconducting systems. Quantum
fluctuations renormalize the classical Josephson oscillation frequencies. Large
amplitude phase oscillations are modulated, exhibiting collapses and revivals.
We describe a new inter-well oscillation mode, with a vanishing (ensemble
averaged) mean value of the observables, but with oscillating mean square
fluctuations. Increasing the number of condensate atoms, we recover the
classical Gross-Pitaevskii (Josephson) dynamics, without invoking the
symmetry-breaking of the Gauge invariance.

squared flux operator is defined by normal ordering. In this case, both the
mean flux and the mean squared flux are well defined local quantites. It is
shown that the flux undergoes large fluctuations on a time scale of the order
of the black hole's mass. Thus the semiclassical theory of gravity, in which a
classical gravitational field is coupled to the expectation value of the stress
tensor, breaks down below this time scale. In the second approach, one does not
attempt to give meaning to the squared flux as a local quantity, but only as a
time-averaged quantity. In both approaches, the mean squared mass minus the
square of the mean mass grows linearly in time, but four times as fast in the

at the January 1999 Mini-course in Number Theory, held at Sogang University
(Seoul). The aim is to give an elementary and self-contained introduction to
the theory of Newton polygons (namely, the $p$-adic Riemann hypothesis) for
L-functions of exponential sums over a finite field.
  The main idea of our approach is to establish a suitable local to global
principal which would allowus to reduce the harder ``global'' case to various
easier well understood ""local"" cases for which Stickelberger's theorem applies.
For this purpose, a systematic decomposition method was introduced in our
earlier paper and several decomposition theorems were proved, including the
facial decomposition theorem, the star decomposition theorem and the hyperplane
decomposition theorem. These theorems easily recover previously known results
on Newton polygons of exponential sums. They are also enough for a number of
further applications such as Mazur's conjecture for a generic hypersurface and
a weaker form of the more general Adolphson-Sperber conjecture for a generic
exponential sum. Using our earlier method, we have recently found a more
flexible collapsing decomposition theorem. This theorem gives a fairly
satisfactory answer to the full form of the Adolphson-Sperber conjecture. In
particular, as an application, we now know that the full form of the
Adolphson-Sperber conjecture is true in every low dimension $n\leq 3$ but false
in every high dimension $n\geq 4$. These results are explained in these notes.

been developed recently in which the EOS can be varied, for instance like the
one observed in lattice gauge studies. It is found that -- somewhat
paradoxically -- the partial transparency of the two nuclei provides new
avenues to assess the influence of baryon number in hot matter. One of the
signals which are most sensitive to the dynamics is the directed flow of
nucleons. As a function of rapidity it changes its direction three times.
Surprisingly, even one of the most simple observables -- the average transverse
momenta or slopes -- displays some significant sensitivity to the EOS in the
phase transition region between hadronic and quark matter.
