variations in X-ray flux on <~ 1 hr timescales as well as indications of
changes in X-ray absorbing column on timescales of several years, suggesting
that flares and variable obscuration are responsible for the large amplitude
optical variability of TW Hya on short and long timescales, respectively. The
ASCA spectra of TW Hya, which is ~ 20 Myr old, has a mass of ~ 0.7 M_sun, and
is surrounded by a dusty circumstellar disk, offer perhaps the best indication
yet of the X-ray spectrum of the young Sun during the epoch of Jovian planet
building. Comparison with model calculations suggests that TW Hya produces
sufficient hard X-ray flux to produce significant ionization of molecular gas
within its circumstellar disk; such X-ray ionization may regulate both
protoplanetary accretion and protoplanetary chemistry.

smoothly bridges the gap between the previously distinct subclasses of LBLs and

cluster mass. Arc properties in the most massive clusters in the sample (i.e.
those with velocity dispersion, \sigma \sim 1500-2000 km/s) are essentially
consistent with the N-body predictions. On the other hand, giant arcs in \sigma

dSph is estimated with the luminous mass, since the observed large velocity
dispersions of the dSphs are attributed to the tidal force by the Galaxy), and
[2] a DM model (the mass of a dSph is estimated with the virial mass, since the
velocity dispersion is considered to reflect the DM potential). In both models,
we find that the relation between the surface brightness of the dSphs and the
tidal force by the Galaxy is consistently interpreted. This makes a critical
remark about the previous studies that concluded that the tidal force is
effective for the dSphs based only on model [1]. We also check the correlation
between the Galactocentric distance and the tidal force. Consequently, both
models are also supported in this test. Thus, we are unable to judge which of
the two is more promising for the dSphs in correlation investigations. The
physical process of tidal disruption is also considered. Since the timescale
for the tidally perturbed stars to escape is much shorter than the orbital
periods of the dSphs, it is difficult for the tidally perturbed dSphs to exist
as an assembly. Thus, we suggest that the gravitational field of DM is
necessary to bind the dSphs with a large velocity dispersion.

the fitting process. We find that $K^*(z)$ departs from no-evolution

the evolutionary history of galaxies over the range of environmental densities

analyses based on the color evolution of high redshift cluster E/S0 galaxies,

that an essential part (about 20%) of the energy that is lost by the wind in
the process of its deceleration may be transferred to high-energy electrons and
then to high-frequency (X-ray and gamma-ray) emission. We show that in the wind
frame the spectrum of electrons which are accelerated at the wind front and
move ahead of the front is nearly a two-dimensional relativistic Maxwellian
with a relativistic temperature $T=6*10^9\Gamma_T$ K, where
$\Gamma_T=200\Gamma_0$ with the accuracy of ~20%, and $\Gamma_0$ is the Lorentz

Large-amplitude electromagnetic waves are generated by the oscillating currents

profiles of O, Ne, and Fe show clear jump structures at a radius of 0.9 Rs,
where Rs is the shock radius. Outside of 0.9 Rs, abundances of all elements are
constant. On the contrary, inside of 0.9 Rs, abundances of these elements are
20--30 % larger than those obtained outside of 0.9 Rs. The radial profile of
kTe also shows the jump structure at 0.9 Rs. This means that the hot and metal
rich plasma fills the volume inside of 0.9 Rs. We concluded that this jump
structure was the possible evidence for the pre-existing cavity produced by the
precursor. If the ejecta fills inside of 0.9 Rs, the total mass of the ejecta
was roughly 4\Msun. We then estimated the main-sequence mass to be roughly
15\Msun, which supports the massive star in origin of the Cygnus Loop supernova
remnant and the existence of a pre-existing cavity.

distance between succeeding shells approaches zero (``the zero spacing limit'')
and helicity conservation is retained. We obtain a discrete field theory which
is numerically shown to have pulse solutions travelling with constant speed and
with unchanged form. We give numerical evidence that the model might even be
exactly integrable, although the continuum limit seems to be singular and the
pulses show an unusual super exponential decay to zero as $\exp(-
\mathrm{const} \sigma^n)$ when $n \to \infty$, where $\sigma$ is the {\em

should accelerate, moving to infinity in a finite time. Finally we show that
the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the GOY model approaches zero in this limit.

previous works. Our simulated system is a stoichiometric two-dimensional binary
alloy with a single vacancy which evolves according to the vacancy-atom
exchange mechanism. We obtain that, compared to the symmetric case, the
ordering process slows down dramatically. Concerning the asymptotic behavior it
is algebraic and characterized by the Allen-Cahn growth exponent x=1/2. The
late stages of the evolution are preceded by a transient regime strongly
affected by both the temperature and the degree of asymmetry of the alloy. The
results are discussed and compared to those obtained for the symmetric case.

dichotomous random field. The problem is reduced to a random iterated function
system for an effective field. The D_q-spectrum of the invariant measure of
this effective field exhibits a sharp drop of all D_q with q < 0 at some
critical strength of the random field. We introduce the concept of orbits which
naturally group the points of the support of the invariant measure. We then
show that the pointwise dimension at all points of an orbit has the same value
and calculate it for a class of periodic orbits and their so-called offshoots
as well as for generic orbits in the non-overlapping case. The sharp drop in
the D_q-spectrum is analytically explained by a drastic change of the scaling
properties of the measure near the points of a certain periodic orbit at a
critical strength of the random field which is explicitly given. A similar
drastic change near the points of a special family of periodic orbits explains
a second, hitherto unnoticed transition in the D_q-spectrum. As it turns out, a
decisive role in this mechanism is played by a specific offshoot. We
furthermore give rigorous upper and/or lower bounds on all D_q in a wide
parameter range. In most cases the numerically obtained D_q coincide with
either the upper or the lower bound. The results in this paper are relevant for
the understanding of random iterated function systems in the case of moderate
overlap in which periodic orbits with weak singularity can play a decisive
role.

incommensuration close to dimerization; both q, the deviation of the wave
number from pi, and delta, the strength of the incommensuration, are small. For
free fermions, we use a continuum Dirac theory to show that there are an
infinite number of bands which meet at zero energy as q approaches zero. In the
limit that the ratio q/ \delta --> 0, the number of states lying inside the q=0
gap is nonzero and equal to 2 \delta /\pi^2. Thus the limit q --> 0 differs
from q=0; this can be seen clearly in the behavior of the specific heat at low
temperature. For interacting fermions or the XXZ spin-1/2 chain close to
dimerization, we use bosonization to argue that similar results hold; as q -->
0, we find a nontrivial density of states near zero energy. However, the limit
q --> 0 and q=0 give the same results near commensurate wave numbers which are
different from pi. We apply our results to the Azbel-Hofstadter problem of
electrons hopping on a two-dimensional lattice in the presence of a magnetic
field. Finally, we discuss the complete energy spectrum of noninteracting
fermions with incommensurate hopping by going up to higher orders in delta.

referred to as Virtual Network Configuration (VNC) which uses predicted future
states of a system for faster network configuration and management. VNC is
applied to the configuration of a wireless mobile ATM network. VNC is built on
techniques from parallel discrete event simulation merged with constraints from
real-time systems and applied to mobile ATM configuration and handoff.
  Configuration in a mobile network is a dynamic and continuous process.
Factors such as load, distance, capacity and topology are all constantly
changing in a mobile environment. The VNC algorithm anticipates configuration
changes and speeds the reconfiguration process by pre-computing and caching
results. VNC propagates local prediction results throughout the VNC enhanced
system. The Global Positioning System is an enabling technology for the use of
VNC in mobile networks because it provides location information and accurate
time for each node.
  This research has resulted in well defined structures for the encapsulation
of physical processes within Logical Processes and a generic library for
enhancing a system with VNC. Enhancing an existing system with VNC is straight
forward assuming the existing physical processes do not have side effects. The
benefit of prediction is gained at the cost of additional traffic and
processing. This research includes an analysis of VNC and suggestions for
optimization of the VNC algorithm and its parameters.

the detailed component models of phonology, word-order, and word frequency can
be replaced in a modular fashion. The model yields a language-independent,
prior probability distribution on all possible sequences of all possible words
over a given alphabet, based on the assumption that the input was generated by
concatenating words from a fixed but unknown lexicon. The model is unusual in
that it treats the generation of a complete corpus, regardless of length, as a
single event in the probability space. Accordingly, the algorithm does not
estimate a probability distribution on words; instead, it attempts to calculate
the prior probabilities of various word sequences that could underlie the
observed text. Experiments on phonemic transcripts of spontaneous speech by
parents to young children suggest that this algorithm is more effective than
other proposed algorithms, at least when utterance boundaries are given and the

to 2D quantum gravity dresses the conformal weights to get new critical

effected by putting the spin models on annealed ensembles of planar random
graphs or their dual triangulations, where the connectivity fluctuates on the
same time-scale as the spins.
  Since the sole determining factor in the dressing is the central charge, one
could contemplate putting a spin model on a quenched ensemble of 2D gravity
graphs with the ``wrong'' central charge. We might then expect to see the
critical exponents appropriate to the central charge used in generating the
graphs. In such cases the KPZ formula could be interpreted as giving a
continuous line of critical exponents which depend on this central charge. We
note that rational exponents other than the KPZ values can be generated using
this procedure for the Ising, tricritical Ising and 3-state Potts models.

method of QCD sum rules. Our calculations are based on the parity and time
reversal violating parameter $\thetabar$ in QCD and establish a functional
dependence of the NEDM on $\thetabar$, without assuming a perturbative
expansion of this symmetry breaking parameter. The results obtained from the
QCD sum rules approach are shown to be consistent with the general symmetry
constraints on CP violations in QCD, including the necessity of: (1) finite
quark masses, (2) spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking, and (3) the U_A(1)
anomaly. Given the current experimental upper bound on the neutron electric
dipole moment (nEDM), d_n < 10^(-25) e-cm, we find | \thetabar | < 10^(-9).
This result is compatible with previous calculations of nEDM using different
techniques and excludes the possibility of solving the strong CP problem within
QCD via a dynamical suppression mechanism.

arguments and experimental evidences supporting the proposed picture are

particular that the size- and the lifetime-distributions of such gluon-clusters
can be directly extracted from the data, and the obtained results exhibit
universal power-law behaviors --- in accordance with the expected
SOC-fingerprints. As further consequences of SOC in systems of interacting soft

boundary conditions. The eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are given as
solutions of a system of quadratic equations in a space of higher order theta
functions.

McDuff-Salamon. The main point of the arguments is to introduce a method
dealing with the transversality problems in the case of noncompact manifolds.
Moreover, the techniques are also used to study the topological rigidity of
Hamiltonian loops with compact support on a class of noncompact symplectic
manifolds.

Alexander polynomials defined by Akutsu, Deguchi and Ohtsuki intersect
non-trivially. Moreover it is shown that the intersection is (at least
includes) the set of Kashaev's quantum dilogarithm invariants for links.
Therefore Kashaev's conjecture can be restated as follows: The colored Jones
polynomials determine the hyperbolic volume for a hyperbolic knot. Modifying
this, we propose a stronger conjecture: The colored Jones polynomials determine
the simplicial volume for any knot. If our conjecture is true, then we can
prove that a knot is trivial if and only if all of its Vassiliev invariants are
trivial.

that incorporates spinor distortion and density-dependent nucleon form factors
using an effective momentum approximation. This method can be used in a
coordinate-space approach with either relativistic or nonrelativistic optical
potentials and overlap functions. We studied these effects for the
$^{16}O(\vec{e},e' \vec{p})$ reaction at Q^2 = 0.8 (GeV/c)^2. Spinor distortion
substantially enhances the left-right asymmetry while reducing the ratio
between sideways and longitudinal recoil polarization for p-shell knockout by
about 5% for modest missing momenta. We also find that the density dependence
of nucleon form factors suggested by a quark-meson coupling model reduces the
polarization ratio further. Much larger effects are obtained for the s-shell
than for p-shell. However, both effects are subject to much larger Gordon
ambiguities than comparable nonrelativistic calculations.

movable mirror is considered and quantum statistical properties of the field
are studied. Such a system can serve in principle as an idealized meter for
detection of a weak classical force coupled to the mirror which is modelled by
a quantum harmonic oscillator. It is shown that the standard quantum limit on
the measurement of the mirror position arises naturally from the properties of
the system during its dynamical evolution. However, the force detection
sensitivity of the system falls short of the corresponding standard quantum
limit. We also study the effect of the nonlinear interaction between the moving
mirror and the radiation pressure on the quadrature fluctuations of the
initially coherent cavity field.

on the superalgebras sl(N/K). The general conclusion is that, with the full
``supersymmetry'', none of these models is relativistic. When the supersymmetry
is broken by the generator of the sub u(1), Gross Neveu models of various types
are obtained. For instance, in the case of sl(N/K) with a typical fermionic
representation on every site, the continuum limit is the GN model with N colors
and K flavors. In the case of sl(N/1) and atypical representations of spin j, a
close cousin of the GN model with N colors, j flavors and flavor anisotropy is
obtained. The Dynkin parameter associated with the fermionic root, while
providing solutions to the Yang Baxter equation with a continuous parameter,
thus does not give rise to any new physics in the field theory limit.
  These features are generalized to the case where an impurity is embedded in
the system.
