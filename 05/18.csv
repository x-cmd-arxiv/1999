orbit is in good agreement with the spectroscopic results, and the physical
parameters implied by a combined fit to our interferometric visibility data and
radial velocity data of Duquennoy and Mayor result in precise component masses
that agree well with their spectral type identifications. In particular, the
orbital parallax of the system is determined to be 43.29 \pm 0.46 mas, and

  Nadal et al. put forward arguments of temporal variability in some of the

we have performed both high dynamic-range near-infrared imaging and

determine the primordial Li abundance within new, much tighter limits. We show
that the Li constraint on $\Omega_b$ is now limited principally by
uncertainties in the nuclear cross-sections used in BBN {\it calculations}, not

recent discussions of the low luminosity, hard X-ray emission from accreting

virialized and relativistic energies for non-thermal protons are likely.
Observational confirmation of the energetic protons' presence could further
support the two-temperature accretion flow models. We point out that
synchrotron emission from nonthermal relativistic protons could provide an
observational signature in strongly magnetized neutron star systems. The
self-absorbed synchrotron emission from an accreting neutron star with the

assumptions that QSOs and GBHCs are powered by similar accretion processes and
that their emission mechanisms are also similar. The QSO luminosity function
(LF) evolution in various energy bands is strongly affected by the spectral
evolution which is tightly correlated with the luminosity evolution. We
generate a random sample of QSOs born nearly synchronously by allowing the QSOs
to have redshifts in a narrow range around an initial high redshift, black hole
masses according to a power-law, and mass accretion rates near Eddington rates.
The QSOs evolve as a single long-lived population on the cosmological time
scale. The pure luminosity evolution results in distinct luminosity evolution
features due to the strong spectral evolution. Most notably, different energy
bands (optical/UV, soft X-ray, and hard X-ray) show different evolutionary
trends and the hard X-ray LF in particular shows an apparent reversal of the
luminosity evolution (from decreasing to increasing luminosity) at low
redshifts, which is not seen in the conventional pure luminosity evolution

torque reversal accompanied by a dramatic spectral transition and a relatively
small luminosity change. The time-averaged X-ray spectrum during spin-down is
considerably harder than during spin-up. The observed torque reversal can be
explained by an accretion flow transition triggered by a gradual change in the
mass accretion rate. The sudden transition to spin-down is caused by a change
in the accretion flow rotation from Keplerian to sub-Keplerian. 4U 1626-67 is
estimated to be near spin equilibrium with a mass accretion rate Mdot~2x10**16
g/s, Mdot decreasing at a rate ~6x10**14 g/s/yr, and a polar surface magnetic
field of ~2b_p**{-1/2} 10^**12G where b_p is the magnetic pitch. During
spin-up, the Keplerian flow remains geometrically thin and cool. During
spin-down, the sub-Keplerian flow becomes geometrically thick and hot. Soft
photons from near the stellar surface are Compton up-scattered by the hot
accretion flow during spin-down while during spin-up such scattering is
unlikely due to the small scale-height and low temperature of the flow. This
mechanism accounts for the observed spectral hardening and small luminosity
change. The scattering occurs in a hot radially falling column of material with
a scattering depth ~0.3 and a temperature ~10^9K. The X-ray luminosity at
energies >5keV could be a poor indicator of the mass accretion rate. We briefly
discuss the possible application of this mechanism to GX 1+4, although there

bright galactic nuclei (XBGN) are a heterogeneous group which includes LINERs,
low to moderate luminosity Seyferts, and narrow-line X-ray galaxies with 2-10
keV X-ray luminosities in the range ~10**39 to ~10**43 erg/s. In the absence of
a radio jet, the core 15 GHz radio luminosity of an ADAF is relatively low and
roughly proportional to the mass of the central black hole. The predicted radio
luminosity depends primarily on the black hole mass and for XBGN typically
falls in the range 10**35-10**39 erg/s. We designate these as ``radio quiet''
XBGN. However, some level of jet activity seems to be present in most sources
and the radio emission can be considerably larger than that from the ADAF core.
We discuss connections between radio-bright XBGN and radio-loud, powerful
active galactic nuclei (AGN) and suggest that the radio activities are directly
correlated with black hole spins in both cases. Even in the presence of a radio
jet, high resolution, high frequency radio imaging of nearby XBGN could
identify compact, inverted spectrum ADAF radio sources. The unique radio/X-ray
luminosity relation is confirmed in a few cases where black hole masses are
known and could be used as a tool to estimate unknown black hole masses. For
radio-dim (L_<10**39 erg/s), X-ray bright (L_x>10**43 erg/s) sources, which are
primarily Seyferts, the X-ray emission mechanism is not accounted for by pure
ADAFs and radio activities are likely to be similar to those of the radio-quiet
AGN.

reverberation and spectroscopy data, twice the number available previously. The
data provide strong evidence that the BLR size and the emission-line width
measure directly the central mass. Two methods are used to estimate the
distance of the broad emission-line region (BLR) from the ionizing source: the
photoionization method (available for many AGNs but has large intrinsic
uncertainties), and the reverberation method (gives very reliable distances,
but available for only a few objects). The distance estimate is combined with
the velocity dispersion, derived from the broad Hb line profile, to estimate
the virial mass. Comparing the central masses calculated with the reverberation
method to those calculated using a photoionization model, we find a highly
significant, nearly linear correlation. This provides a calibration of the
photoionization method on the objects with presently available reverberation
data, which should enable mass estimates for all AGNs with measured Hb line
width. Comparing the BLR sizes given by the two methods also enables us to
estimate the ionizing EUV luminosity which is directly unobservable. We find it
to be typically ten times the visible (monochromatic luminosity at 5100A). The
inferred Eddington ratio of the individual objects in our sample are 0.001-0.03

evaluate the efficiency of these linear instabilities. However, the conditions

It is nonaxisymmetric, and begins close to the accretor in the equatorial

shorter than the planetary formation timescale. Therefore we investigate planet
formation in the context of a migrating core, considering both the growth of
the core and the build-up of the envelope in the course of the migration.

considering the Lagrangian dynamics of 4 points (the tetrad). The closure of
the equations of motion is achieved by postulating an anisotropic, i.e. tetrad
shape dependent, relation of the local pressure and the velocity gradient
defined on the tetrad. The non-local contribution to the pressure and the
incoherent small scale fluctuations are modeled as Gaussian white ""noise"". The
resulting stochastic model for the coarse-grained velocity gradient is analyzed
approximately, yielding predictions for the probability distribution functions
of different 2nd and 3d order invariants. The results are compared with the
direct numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes. The model provides a
reasonable representation of the non-linear dynamics involved in energy
transfer and vortex stretching and allows to study interesting aspects of the
statistical geometry of turbulence, e.g. vorticity/strain alignment. In a state
with a constant energy flux (and K41 power spectrum) it exhibits the anomalous
scaling of high moments associated with formation of high gradient sheets -
events associated with large energy transfer. An approach to the more complete
analysis of the stochastic model, properly including the effect of
fluctuations, is outlined and will enable further quantitative juxtaposition of

approach the Edwards-Anderson value by means of a power-law in time. at long

itself is not superconducting but is in electrical contact with a
superconductor. As the carriers of superconductivity, the Cooper pairs, diffuse
across the contact into the metal they remain correlated, although the pairing
mechanism is lifted; we call this the proximity effect. The observation of
these superconducting correlations has come within the reach of experiments in
the last decade. With state-of-the-art fabrication techniques mesoscopic
samples have been produced which are small and clean enough for the quantum
mechanical coherence of the electrons to be preserved over the sample size.

a simpler equation for the shift vector. Using this gauge condition, we have
performed several simulations of the merger between two identical clusters in
which we have varied the compaction, the type of internal motion in the
clusters, and the magnitude of the orbital velocity. As a result of the
coalescence, either a new rotating cluster or a black hole is formed. In the
case in which a black hole is not formed, simulations could be carried out for
a time much longer than the dynamical time scale, and the resulting
gravitational waveforms were calculated fairly accurately: In these cases, the
amplitude of gravitational waves emitted can be $\sim
10^{-18}(M/10^6M_{\odot})$ at a distance 4000Mpc, and $\sim 0.5%$ of the rest
mass energy may be dissipated by the gravitational wave emission in the final
phase of the merger. These results confirm that the new spatial gauge condition
is promising in many problems at least up to the formation of black holes. In
the case in which a black hole is formed, on the other hand, the gauge
condition seems to be less adequate, but we suggest a strategy to improve it in
this case. All of the results obtained confirm the robustness of our

order $\Gamma^{-1} \sim r^{-2n}$, where $n$ is the number of ``photons''
required for ionization, with enhanced stability at resonances. For late times
the decay is like $t^{-3}$. Results are for a 1d system with a delta function
potential of strength $-g(1 + \eta (t))$ but comparison with experiments on the
microwave ionization of excited hydrogen atoms and with recent analytical work
indicate that many features are universal.

Potential (TOP) trap with its four degrees of freedom, namely the three
translations and the spin, taken into account. We find that, when gravity is
neglected, there are two parameters in the problem namely, the angular velocity
of the rotating field and its strength. We present the stability diagram in
these parameters. We find the mode frequencies calculated from the
time-averaged potential model used by the inventors of the TOP is an excellent
approximation to our exact results. However, for other parameters, this may not
be the case.
