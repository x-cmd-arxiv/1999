possibly the black hole spin. This method depends on the validity of one
assumption: that the optical and ultraviolet continuum of the quasar is
produced on the surface of an azimuthally symmetric, flat equatorial disk,
whose gas follows prograde circular orbits in a Kerr spacetime (and plunges
inside the marginally stable orbit). Given this assumption, we advocate using a
variant of first-order linear regularization to invert multi-frequency
microlensing lightcurves to obtain the disk surface brightness as a function of
radius and frequency. The other parameters can be found by minimizing
chi-square in a fashion consistent with the regularized solution for the

confirm that the surface brightness can be reconstructed quite well near its

  This work presents an image processing method in which we propose statistical

is based on a wavelet analysis of a signal. Because the temperature or
brightness distribution is a rather weak discriminator, the search for the
statistical signature of non-gaussianity relies on the study of the coefficient
distribution of an image in the wavelet decomposition basis which is much more
sensitive.
  We develop two statistical tests for non-gaussianity. In order to test their
reliability, we apply them to sets of test maps representing a combination of

chain which occurs in equilibrium. These segregated conformations are
characterized by a nucleus of monomers which are superimposable upon the native
conformation. We computationally generate the phase segregation by applying a
``folding pressure,'' or adding an energetic bonus for native monomer-monomer
contacts. The computer models reveal a fundamental difference in the nucleation
process between heteropolymeric and the more familiar vapor-liquid systems: in
a polymer system, some nuclei hinder folding via topological constraints and
must be partially destroyed in order for folding to proceed. To illustrate this
finding, we examine the kinetics of protein unfolding in the long chain limit
through scaling arguments. We find that because of the topological constraints,
the critical nucleus size is of the order of the entire chain size so that
unfolding time scales as $\exp [c N^{2/3} ]$, where $N$ and $c$ are the chain
length and a constant.

to the topology of macromolecules indicates that the simple trefoil or

of the theory is obtained from a non-perturbative sum of scalar curvature terms

equations derived from it. As a result of non-perturbative quantum effects, the
scalar curvature of the matter-dominated universe stops decreasing and
approaches a constant value. The universe in our model evolves from an open
matter-dominated epoch to a mildly inflating de Sitter expansion. The Hubble
constant during the present de Sitter epoch, as well as the time at which the
transition occurs from matter-dominated to de Sitter expansion, are determined
by the mass of the field and by the present matter density. The model provides
a theoretical explanation of the observed recent acceleration of the universe,
and gives a good fit to data from high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, with a mass
of about 10^{-33} eV, and a current ratio of matter density to critical
density, Omega_0 <0.4 . The age of the universe then follows with no further
free parameters in the theory, and turns out to be greater than 13 Gyr. The
model is spatially open and consistent with the possibility of inflation in the

alternatively, an infrared attractor of a double valued couplant as noted by

Pad\'e-summation $\beta$-functions incorporating $[2|1], [1|2], [2|2], [1|3]$,

of their first positive zero, precluding any identification of this first
positive zero as an infrared-stable fixed point of the $\beta$- function. This
result is shown to be true regardless of the magnitude of the presently-unknown
five-loop $\beta$-function contribution. Moreover, the pole in question
suggests the occurrence of dynamics in which both a strong and an
asymptotically-free phase share a common infrared attractor. We briefly discuss
the possible relevance of infrared-attractor dynamics to the success of recent
calculations of the glueball mass spectra in QCD with $N_c \to \infty$ via
supergravity. As $n_f$ increases above an approximant-dependent flavour

and find the conditions under which the masses of scalars with large Yukawa
couplings are driven, radiatively and asymptotically, to the weak scale through
renormalization group evolution. Light third generation scalars then satisfy
naturalness, while first and second generation scalars remain heavy to satisfy
experimental constraints. We find that this mechanism is beautifully realized
in the context of grand unified theories. In particular, the existence of
right-handed neutrinos plays an important role in allowing remarkably simple

theory governing the transition between quantized Hall plateaus of a disordered
noninteracting 2d electron gas, is proposed. The theory is a nonlinear sigma
model with a Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten term, and fields taking values in a
Riemannian symmetric superspace based on H^3 x S^3. Essentially the same
conformal field theory appeared in very recent work on string propagation in
AdS_3 backgrounds. We explain how the proposed theory manages to obey a number
of tight constraints, two of which are constancy of the partition function and
noncriticality of the local density of states. An unexpected feature is the
existence of a truly marginal deformation, restricting the extent to which
universality can hold in critical quantum Hall systems. The marginal coupling
is fixed by matching the short-distance singularity of the conductance between
two interior contacts to the classical conductivity sigma_xx = 1/2 of the
Chalker-Coddington network model. For this value, perturbation theory predicts
a critical exponent 2/pi for the typical point-contact conductance, in
agreement with numerical simulations. The irrational exponent is tolerated by
the fact that the symmetry algebra of the field theory is Virasoro but not

Deep Inelastic structure functions of the proton from the fundamental theory of
strong interactions, Quantum ChromoDynamics (QCD). In the Bjorken limit, the
momenta of the constituents of the proton (the partons) can be assumed to be in
a two-dimensional plane in Minkowski space: a dimensional reduction of QCD to
two space-time dimensions. Two dimensional QCD is then shown to be equivalent
for all energies and values of number of colors \m{N} to a new theory of
hadrons, Quantum HadronDynamics (QHD). The phase space of QHD is the
Grassmannian (set of subspaces) of the complex Hilbert space L^2(R). The
natural symplectic form along with a hamiltonian define a classical dynamical
system, which is equivalent to the large N limit of QCD. 't Hooft's planar
limit is the linear approximation to our theory: we recover his integral
equation for the meson spectrum but also all the interactions of the mesons.
The Grassmannian is a union of connected components labelled by an integer (the
renormalized dimension of the subspace) which has the physical meaning of
baryon number. The proton is the topological soliton: the minimum of the energy
in the sector with baryon number one gives the structure functions of the
proton. We solve the resulting integral equations numerically; the agreement

  Uncertainty Principle?","6 pages, twocolumn. Revised. To appear in Foundations of Physics","Found.Phys. 29 (1999) 1849",,,"quant-ph",,"  An entangled pair of photons (1 and 2) are emitted to opposite directions. A
narrow slit is placed in the path of photon 1 to provide precise knowledge of
its position on the $y$ axis and this also determines the precise $y$ position
of its twin, photon 2, due to quantum entanglement. Is photon 2 going to
experience a greater uncertainty in momentum, i.e., a greater $\Delta p_{y}$,
due to the precise knowledge of its position $y$? The experimental data shows
$\Delta y\Delta p_{y}<\hbar $ for photon 2. Can this recent realization of the
historical thought experiment of Karl Popper signal a violation of the
uncertainty principle?
