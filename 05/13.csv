keV and a power-law-like continuum extending to at least ~800 keV. We interpret
them as emission from an optically-thick, cold accretion disc and from an
optically-thin, non-thermal corona above the disc. A fraction f ~ 0.6 of total
available power is dissipated in the corona. We model the soft component by
multi-colour blackbody disc emission taking into account the torque-free
inner-boundary condition. If the disc extends down to the minimum stable orbit,
the ASCA/RXTE data yield the most probable black hole mass of about 10 solar
masses and an accretion rate about 0.5 L_E/c^2, locating Cyg X-1 in the soft
state in the upper part of the stable, gas-pressure dominated, accretion-disc
solution branch. The spectrum of the corona is well modelled by repeated
Compton scattering of seed photons from the disc off electrons with a hybrid,
thermal/non-thermal distribution. The electron distribution can be
characterized by a Maxwellian with an equilibrium temperature of kT ~ 30--50
keV and a Thomson optical depth of ~0.3 and a quasi-power-law tail. The
compactness of the corona is between 2 and 7, and a presence of a significant
population of electron-positron pairs is ruled out. We find strong signatures
of Compton reflection from a cold and ionized medium, presumably an accretion
disc, with an apparent reflector solid angle ~0.5--0.7. The reflected continuum
is accompanied by a broad iron K-alpha line.

of the region between 0.4 and 2.5 $R_E$ from the lens star, where $R_E$ is the
Einstein ring radius of the lens. This exclusion region is more extensive than
the generic ""lensing zone"" which is $0.6 - 1.6 R_E$. For smaller mass planets,

0.05 to 0.3. We have compared the FP for A665 and A2218 with the FP for the
three clusters CL0024+16, CL1358+62 and MS2053-04 with redshifts between 0.33
and 0.58, and with the FP for the Coma cluster. The scatter around the FP is
similar for all six clusters. We find that the slope of the FP for the
intermediate redshift clusters is slightly different from the one found for the
Coma cluster and other nearby clusters. This may either be caused by selection
effects for the intermediate redshift clusters or by differences in the
evolution of low luminosity galaxies and high luminosity galaxies. The
mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, as measured from the FP, change with redshift.
Using the data for all five intermediate redshift clusters, we find that the
M/L ratios for photometry calibrated to Gunn r change with redshift as Delta
log M/L_r = (-0.26+-0.06) Delta z for q0=0.5. This is consistent with the
previously published analysis for CL0024+16, CL1358+62 and MS2053-04. For
q0=0.5 the results are consistent with passive evolution of a stellar
population which formed at a redshift larger than five. For q0=0.15 the
formation redshift must be larger than 1.7. Our new data for A665 and A2218
confirm the gradual and slow evolution of the bright E and S0 galaxies.
However, possible star formation in E and S0 galaxies during the last 3-4 Gyr

richness (defined by the mean separation of neighbor objects), the clustering
strengths of both simulation and observation sample are found to be declining

  includes additional material following referee's suggestions",,"10.1051/aas:2000308",,"astro-ph",,"  A major problem in Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy mapping,
especially in a total-power mode, is the presence of low-frequency noise in the
data streams. If unproperly processed, such low-frequency noise leads to
striping in the maps. To deal with this problem, solutions have already been
found for mapping the CMB temperature fluctuations but no solution has yet been
proposed for the measurement of CMB polarization. Complications arise due to
the scan-dependent orientation of the measured polarization. In this paper, we
investigate a method for building temperature and polarization maps with
minimal striping effects in the case of a circular scanning strategy mission
such as the Planck mission.

metal-deficient stars Rb is systematically overabundant relative to Fe; we find
an average [Rb/Fe] of +0.21 for the 32 stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 and measured
Rb. This behavior contrasts with that of Y, Zr, and Ba, which, with the
exception of three new CH stars (HD 23439A and B and BD +5 3640), are
consistently slightly deficient relative to Fe in the same stars; excluding the
three CH stars, we find the stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 have average [Y/Fe],
[Zr/Fe], and [Ba/Fe] of --0.19 (24 stars), --0.12 (28 stars), and --0.06 (29
stars), respectively. The different behavior of Rb on the one hand and Y, Zr,
and Ba on the other can be attributed in part to the fact that in the Sun and
in these stars Rb has a large r-process component while Y, Zr, and Ba are
mostly s-process elements with only small r-process components. In addition,
the Rb s-process abundance is dependent on the neutron density at the
s-processing site. Published observations of Rb in s-process enriched red
giants indicate a higher neutron density in the metal-poor giants. These
observations imply a higher s-process abundance for Rb in metal-poor stars. The
calculated combination of the Rb r-process abundance, as estimated for the
stellar Eu abundances, and the s-process abundance as estimated for red giants
accounts satisfactorily for the observed run of [Rb/Fe] with [Fe/H].

random medium regardless of the precise state of the medium. As a prototype, we
consider a point particle moving on a one-dimensional lattice whose sites are
occupied by scatterers with the following properties: (i) the state of each
site is defined by its spin (up or down); (ii) the particle arriving at a site
is scattered forward (backward) if the spin is up (down); (iii) the state of
the site is modified by the passage of the particle, i.e. the spin of the site
where a scattering has taken place, flips ($\uparrow \Leftrightarrow \downarrow
$). We consider one dimensional and triangular lattices, for which we give a
microscopic description of the dynamics, prove the propagation of a particle
through the scatterers, and compute analytically its statistical properties. In
particular we prove that, in one dimension, the average propagation velocity is
$<c(q)> = 1/(3-2q)$, with $q$ the probability that a site has a spin
$\uparrow$, and, in the triangular lattice, the average propagation velocity is
independent of the scatterers distribution: $<c> = 1/8$. In both cases, the
origin of the propagation is a blocking mechanism, restricting the motion of
the particle in the direction opposite to the ultimate propagation direction,
and there is a specific re-organization of the spins after the passage of the
particle. A detailed mathematical analysis of this phenomenon is, to the best

of the new method for the case of a single polymer chain in a solvent are
performed. The dynamic and static scaling properties predicted by analytical
theory are validated. In this context, the influence of the finite size of the
simulation box is discussed. While usually the finite size corrections scale as
L^{-1} (L denoting the linear dimension of the box), the decay rate of the
Rouse modes is only subject to an L^{-3} finite size effect. Furthermore, the
mapping to an existing MD simulation of the same system is done so that all
physical input values for the new method can be derived from pure MD
simulation. Both methods can thus be compared quantitatively, showing that the

obtained in a truncation scheme for their Dyson-Schwinger equations which
implements the Slavnov-Taylor identities for the 3-point vertex functions while
neglecting contributions from irreducible 4-point correlations. In the pure
gauge theory without quarks, non-perturbative solutions for the gluon and ghost
propagators are available in an approximation which allows for an analytic
discussion of their behavior in the infrared: The gluon propagator vanishes for
small spacelike momenta, whereas the ghost propagator is found to be infrared
enhanced. The running coupling of the non-perturbative subtraction scheme
approaches the finite value $\alpha_c \simeq 9.5$ at an infrared fixed point.
The gluon propagator entails a violation of positivity for transverse gluon
states implying their absence from a positive subspace expected for asymptotic
hadronic states and thus confinement. Both propagators, obtained for gluons and
ghosts in the present scheme, compare well with recent lattice calculations.
  In the quenched approximation, the quark propagator describes dynamical
chiral symmetry breaking well, although the corresponding interaction in the
gap equation for the quark self-energy is infrared suppressed. First results of
a simultaneous solution to the coupled system of gluons, ghosts {\sl and}
quarks indicate towards weak, and possibly negligible, vacuum polarisation
effects of dynamical quarks on the gluon and ghost correlations in the
infrared.

extracted from the absorptive part of the forward Compton amplitude in the

function its regularization is consistently determined from the regularization
of the bosonized action. We find that the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme
is most suitable because it preserves both the anomaly structure of QCD and the
leading scaling behavior of hadron structure functions in the Bjorken limit. We
show that this procedure yields the correct pion structure function. In order
to render the sum rules of the regularized polarized nucleon structure
functions consistent with their corresponding axial charges we find it
mandatory to further specify the regularization procedure. This specification
goes beyond the double subtraction scheme commonly employed when studying
static hadron properties in this model. In particular the present approach
serves to determine the regularization prescription for structure functions
whose leading moments are not given by matrix elements of local operators. In
this regard we conclude somewhat surprisingly that in this model the Gottfried

evolution equations is formulated in terms of the notion of invariant
manifolds. We start with derivation of an exact RG equation which is analogous
to the Wilsonian RG equations in statistical physics and quantum field theory.
It is clarified that the perturbative RG method constructs invariant manifolds
successively as the initial value of evolution equations, thereby the meaning
to set $t_0=t$ is naturally understood where $t_0$ is the arbitrary initial
time. We show that the integral constants in the unperturbative solution
constitutes natural coordinates of the invariant manifold when the linear
operator $A$ in the evolution equation has no Jordan cell; when $A$ has a
Jordan cell, a slight modification is necessary because the dimension of the
invariant manifold is increased by the perturbation. The RG equation determines
the slow motion of the would-be integral constants in the unperturbative
solution on the invariant manifold. We present the mechanical procedure to
construct the perturbative solutions hence the initial values with which the RG
equation gives meaningful results. The underlying structure of the reduction by
the RG method as formulated in the present work turns out to completely fit to

reduction procedure of evolution equations has a good correspondence with the
renormalization procedure in quantum field theory; the counter part of the
universal structure of reduction elucidated by Kuramoto may be the Polchinski's
theorem for renormalizable field theories. We apply the method to interface
dynamics such as kink-anti-kink and soliton-soliton interactions in the latter
of which a linear operator having a Jordan-cell structure appears.

  The anomaly induced action under discussion corresponds to 4d formulation
(s-wave approximation, 4d quantum matter is minimal one) as well as 2d
formulation (complete effective action, 2d quantum matter is dilaton coupled
one). Hence, most of results are given for the same gravitational background
with interpretation as 4d quantum corrected BH or 2d quantum corrected
dilatonic BH. Quantum aspects of thermodynamics of 4d 't Hooft BH model are

this configuration (in the Hausdorff topology), but which is a topological

invertibility of the linearized mean curvature operator. This paper treats the
simplest context for our result namely when the surfaces are compact with
nonempty boundary, however the construction applies in the complete, noncompact
