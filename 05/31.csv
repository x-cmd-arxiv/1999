stellar object with extremely red colors from commissioning imaging data of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Its spectrum from 0.8 to 2.5 microns is dominated by
strong bands of H_2 O and CH_4. Its spectrum and colors over this range are
very similar to those of Gliese 229B, the only other known example of a methane
dwarf. It is roughly 1.2 mag fainter than Gliese 229B, implying that it lies at
a distance of roughly 10 pc. Such a cool object must have a mass well below the
hydrogen-burning limit of 0.08 solar masses, and therefore is a genuine brown
dwarf, with a probable mass in the range 0.015-0.06 solar masses for an age
range of 0.3-5 Gyr.

features from the white dwarf, indicating a mean photospheric magnetic field of
36 +- 1 MG. Only weak Balmer line emission was observed. In the near infra-red,
a single intense cyclotron hump was observed. The inferred magnetic field
strength in the accretion plama is 45 +- 1 MG, the temperature in the plasma is
below 2 keV. Likely orbital periods are ~90 min or ~146 min, the latter inside
the cataclysmic variable period gap. The system is an ideal target for further
detailed investigations of the field structure on a magnetic white dwarf by

by pions and photons. The higher-spin baryons are described by Rarita-Schwinger
fields and, as we argue, this imposes a stringent consistency requirement on
the form of the couplings. Popular $\pi N\Delta$ and $\gamma N\Delta$ couplings
are inconsistent from this point of view. We construct examples of consistent
interactions with the same nonrelativistic limit as the conventional ones.

theoretically and by simulation with a one-dimensional electromagnetic
simulation code based on a three-fluid model, with particular attention to the

energy from the pulses. Because of this energy transfer, the pulses are damped
even if the plasma is collisionless and pulse propagation is perpendicular to
the magnetic field.

one-dimensional, relativistic, electromagnetic, particle simulation code with
full ion and electron dynamics. It is found that an oblique shock can produce
electrons with ultra-relativistic energies; Lorentz factors with $\gamma \gto
100$ have been observed in our simulations. The physical mechanisms for the
reflection and acceleration are discussed, and the maximum energy is estimated.
If the electron reflection occurs near the end of a large-amplitude pulse,
those particles will then be trapped in the pulse and gain a great deal of
energy. The theory predicts that the electron energies can become especially
high at certain propagation angles. This is verified by the simulations.

systematic procedure for constructing raising and lowering operators satisfying
any prescribed `distorted' Heisenberg algebra (including the
$q$-generalization). This is done by means of an operator transformation
implemented by a shift operator. The latter is obtained by solving an
appropriate partial isometry condition in the Hilbert space. Formal
representations of the non-local operators concerned are given in terms of
pseudo-differential operators. Using the new annihilation operators, new
classes of coherent states are constructed for isospectral oscillator
Hamiltonians. The corresponding Fock-Bargmann representations are also
considered, with specific reference to the order of the entire function family
in each case.
