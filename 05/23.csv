provides a valuable diagnostic of the dust composition, grain size distribution
and spatial distribution. To facilitate the use of this diagnostic, we present
detailed calculations of the intensity and polarization spectral signature of
light scattered by optically thin and optically thick dust in various
geometries. The polarized light radiative transfer calculations are carried out
using the adding-doubling method for a plane-parallel slab, and are extended to
an optically thick sphere by integrating over its surface. The calculations are
for the Mathis, Rumple & Nordsieck Galactic dust model, and cover the range
from 1 $\mu m$ to 500 \AA. We find that the wavelength dependence of the
scattered light intensity provides a sensitive probe of the optical depth of
the scattering medium, while the polarization wavelength dependence provides a
probe of the grain scattering properties, which is practically independent of
optical depth. We provide a detailed set of predictions, including polarization
maps, which can be used to probe the properties of dust through imaging
spectropolarimetry in the near IR to far UV of various Galactic and
extragalactic objects. In a following paper we use the codes developed here to
provide predictions for the dependence of the intensity and polarization on
grain size distribution and composition.

reddens the galaxies in the direction of the Virgo cluster but does not affect
stars within the Milky Way. This is likely to be a dusty feature in the
foreground of the Virgo cluster, presumably in the galactic halo. The HI
distribution follows the morphology of the FIR emission and shows peculiar
kinematicbehavior. We propose that a highly supersonic past collision between
an HI cloud and the Galactic HI formed a shock that heated the interface gas to
soft X-ray temperatures. HI remnants from the projectile and from the shocked
Galactic HI rain down onto the disk as intermediate velocity gas.
  Our finding emphasizes that extragalactic astronomy must consider the
possibility ofextinction by dust at high Galactic latitude and far from the
Galactic plane, which may show structure on one-degree and smaller scales. This
is particularly important for studies of the Virgo cluster, for example in the
determination of the Hubble constant from Cepheids in cluster galaxies.

  At 3.6 and/or 6 cm we detect a total of 34 discrete sources, 13 of which are
found in five separate extended complexes. These are all multiple or single
extended thermal ultra-compact HII (UCHII) regions. While for each of these
complexes an IRAS counterpart could be reliably found, no IRAS counterpart
could be reliably identified for any of the remaining 21 sources. Of these 21
compact sources, six are candidate UCHII regions, and the other 15 are most
probably background extragalactic non-thermal sources.
  The five IRAS sources associated with the radio continuum complexes all
satisfy the Wood & Churchwell (1989; WC89) color criteria for UCHII. None of
the other 38 IRAS point sources present in our surveyed field show the same
colors. This fraction of WC89 type to total IRAS sources is consistent with
what is found over the entire galactic plane. The fact that, when observed with
a compact VLA configuration, the IRAS sources with ""UCHII colors"" are found to
be associated with arcminute-scale extended sources, rather than with compact
or unresolved radio sources, may have important implications on the estimated
lifetime of UCHII regions.

tailored to probe transitions originating and terminating on the same ground
state level. When pulses of resonant radiation, separated by a time delay $% T,
$ interact with atoms, it is possible to produce Ramsey fringes having widths
of order 1/T. If each pulse contains two counterpropagating travelling wave
modes, the atomic wave function is split into two or more components having
different center-of-mass momenta. Matter-wave interference of these components
leads to atomic gratings, which have been observed in both spatially separated
fields and time separated fields. Time-dependent signals can be transformed
into frequency dependent signals, leading to ground state Ramsey fringes
(GSRF). The signals can be used to probe many problems of fundamental
importance: a precise measurement of the earth gravitational acceleration $g$
and residual gravity in a microgravity environment with an accuracy $6
10^{-9}g;$ the rotation rate measurement with an accuracy of 6 10^{-3} deg/h;
the recoil frequency measurement.
  Since only transitions originating and terminating on the same ground state
are involved, frequency measurements can be carried out using lasers
phase-locked by quartz oscillators having relatively low frequency. Our
technique may allow one to increase the precision by a factor of 100 (the rf-
to quartz oscillator frequencies ratio) over previous experiments based on
Raman-Ramsey fringes or reduce on the same factor requirements for frequency
stabilization.

radius is much lesser than the free-electron quiver motion amplitude. Within
this approximation a perturbation series is obtained in the Keldysh parameter
giving a description of multiphoton processes in the tunneling regime. The
theory is applied to the case of hydrogen-like atoms: The spectrum of higher
order harmonics and the above-threshold ionization rate are derived. The
ionization rate computed in this way determines the amplitudes of the
harmonics. The wave function of the atom proves to be rigid with respect to the
perturbation so that the effect of the laser field on the Coulomb potential in
the computation of the probability amplitudes can be neglected as a first
approximation: This approximation improves as the ratio between the amplitude
of the quiver motion of the electron and the atom radius becomes larger. The

rederived by solving perturbatively the Schr\""{o}dinger equation.
