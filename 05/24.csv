differ between extreme compositions at least tenfold, usually more.
Independently of age, UV-fluxes shortwards of Balmer jump monotonically decline
with the growth of metallicity. Optical and especially IR-region are also
influenced, with the typical difference 10-50 times in fluxes at wavelengths >1
micron. In IR the situation which composition is the brightest emitter gets

For binary systems which obey a local conservation law, the characteristic
domain size is known to grow in time $\tau$ as $R = [B \tau]^n$ with n=1/3,
where B is a constant. The intensities of individual speckles are found to be
nonstationary, persistent time series. The two-time intensity covariance at
wave vector ${\bf k}$ can be collapsed onto a scaling function $Cov(\delta
t,\bar{t})$, where $\delta t = k^{1/n} B |\tau_2-\tau_1|$ and $\bar{t} =
k^{1/n} B (\tau_1+\tau_2)/2$. Both analytically and numerically, the covariance
is found to depend on $\delta t$ only through $\delta t/\bar{t}$ in the
small-$\bar{t}$ limit and $\delta t/\bar{t} ^{1-n}$ in the large-$\bar{t}$
limit, consistent with a simple theory of moving interfaces that applies to any
universality class described by a scalar order parameter. The speckle-intensity
covariance is numerically demonstrated to be equal to the square of the
two-time structure factor of the scattering material, for which an analytic
scaling function is obtained for large $\bar{t}.$ In addition, the two-time,
two-point order-parameter correlation function is found to scale as
$C(r/(B^n\sqrt{\tau_1^{2n}+\tau_2^{2n}}),\tau_1/\tau_2)$, even for quite large

charged) black holes that are ``isolated'' near future time-like infinity or
for a finite time interval. The underlying space-times need not admit a
stationary Killing field even in a neighborhood of the horizon; rather, the
physical assumption is that neither matter fields nor gravitational radiation
fall across the portion of the horizon under consideration. A precise notion of
non-rotating isolated horizons is formulated to capture these ideas. With these
boundary conditions, the gravitational action fails to be differentiable unless
a boundary term is added at the horizon. The required term turns out to be
precisely the Chern-Simons action for the self-dual connection. The resulting
symplectic structure also acquires, in addition to the usual volume piece, a
surface term which is the Chern-Simons symplectic structure. We show that these
modifications affect in subtle but important ways the standard discussion of
constraints, gauge and dynamics. In companion papers, this framework serves as
the point of departure for quantization, a statistical mechanical calculation
of black hole entropy and a derivation of laws of black hole mechanics,
generalized to isolated horizons. It may also have applications in classical
general relativity, particularly in the investigation of of analytic issues
that arise in the numerical studies of black hole collisions.

the appearance of the $\theta$-term in Yang-Mills theory in (3+1) dimensions.
We then present a detailed argument as to why the conventional Hopf term, which
is the topological counterpart in (2+1) dimensions and has been widely used to
realize fractional spin and statistics, is ill-defined unless the soliton
charge vanishes. We show how this restriction can be lifted by means of a
procedure proposed recently, and provide its physical interpretation as well.

high step potential in the context of the Dirac equation are discussed to
derive the 'paradox' first obtained by Klein. The explanation of this effect in
terms of electron-positron production is reassessed. It is shown that a
potential well or barrier in the Dirac equation can become supercritical and
emit positrons or electrons spontaneously if the potential is strong enough. If
the well or barrier is wide enough, a seemingly constant current is emitted.
This phenomenon is transient whereas the tunnelling first calculated by Klein
is time-independent. It is shown that tunnelling without exponential
suppression occurs when an electron is incident on a high barrier, even when
the barrier is not high enough to radiate. Klein tunnelling is therefore a
property of relativistic wave equations and is not necessarily connected to
particle emission. The Coulomb potential is investigated and it is shown that a
heavy nucleus of sufficiently large $Z$ will bind positrons. Correspondingly,
as $Z$ increases the Coulomb barrier should become increasingly transparent to
positrons. This is an example of Klein tunnelling. Phenomena akin to
supercritical positron emission may be studied experimentally in superfluid
