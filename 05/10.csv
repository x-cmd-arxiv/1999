Compact Dwarf galaxy VII Zw 403. VII Zw 403 is the first Blue Compact Dwarf
galaxy for which a clear spatial segregation of the resolved stellar content
into a ""core-halo"" structure is detected. Multicolor HST/WFPC2 observations
indicate that active star formation occurs in the central region, but is
strikingly absent at large radii. Instead, a globular-cluster-like red giant
branch suggests the presence of an old (> 10 Gyr) and metal poor
(<[Fe/H]>=-1.92) stellar population in the halo. While the vast majority of
Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies has been recognized to possess halos of red color
in ground-based surface photometry, our observations of VII Zw 403 establish
for the first time a direct correspondence between a red halo color and the
presence of old, red giant stars. If the halos of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies
are all home to such ancient stellar populations, then the fossil record
conflicts with delayed-formation scenarios for dwarfs.

showing the X-ray lightcurve of NGC4051 obtained by our RXTE monitoring
campaign over the past two and a half years, which shows that the low state
lasted for ~150 days before the May observations (implying that the reflecting
material is > 10^17 cm from the continuum source) and forms part of a
lightcurve showing distinct variations in long-term average flux over
timescales > months. We show that the long-timescale component to X-ray
variability is intrinsic to the primary continuum and is probably distinct from
the variability at shorter timescales, possibly associated with variations in
the accretion flow of matter onto the central black hole. As the source
approaches the low state, the variability process becomes non-linear. NGC4051
may represent a microcosm of all X-ray variability in radio quiet active

presented where the energy density of the true vacuum state (TVS) is zero
without fine tuning. The above models are constructed in the gravitational
theory where a measure of integration \Phi in the action is not necessarily
\sqrt{-g} but it is determined dynamically through additional degrees of
freedom. The ratio \Phi/\sqrt{-g} is a scalar field which can be solved in
terms of the matter degrees of freedom due to the existence of a constraint. We
study a few explicit field theory models where it is possible to combine the
solution of the cosmological constant problem with: 1) possibility for
inflationary scenario for the early universe; 2) spontaneously broken gauge
unified theories (including fermions). The models are free from the well known
problem of the usual scalar-tensor theories in what is concerned with the
classical GR tests. The only difference of the field equations in the Einstein
frame from the canonical equations of the selfconsistent system of Einstein's
gravity and matter fields, is the appearance of the effective scalar field
potential which vanishes in TVS without fine tuning.

channel (1) is very hard since the next-to-leading order (NLO) and
next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections are large. In particular,
the contributions of the NNLO QCD subprocess $gg -> \gamma \gamma$ to inclusive
$\gamma\gamma$ production is comparable to the contribution of the leading
order subprocess $q\bar{q} -> \gamma \gamma$. The quantitative description of
the background to channel (1), therefore, requires to calculate all corrections
up to the NNNLO level. In this letter we present results on the contribution of
the NNLO QCD subprocess $gg -> g \gamma \gamma$ to the production rate of
channel (2). We have found that in this case this NNLO contribution is less
than 20% of the Born contribution. Since the NNLO contributions will likely be
dominated by this subprocess one can argue that in the case of channel (2) -
contrary to the case of channel (1)- a quantitative description of the

constructed. The Bedford-Wang experiment is examined, and the ambiguity in its
meaning is addressed. We eliminate this ambiguity by abandoning the idea of the
triggering event, replacing the two-state system with a mirror that undergoes
wave packet spreading. This creates an experimentally testable version of a
modified Schroedinger's Cat experiment for which a null result is not the
obvious outcome.

defined in a one dimensional cyclic lattice with an odd number of sites. In
each step of time evolution, each particle acts as a source for the
polarization field of the other type of particle with nonlocal action but with
an effect decreasing with the distance: A -->...\bar{B} B \bar{B} B \bar{B} ...
; B --> A \bar{A} A \bar{A} A ... . It is shown that the combined distribution
of these particles obeys the time evolution of a free particle as given by
quantum mechanics.

interpretation as a classical field theory is emphasized. Two coupled real
fields are defined with given equations of motion. Densities and currents
associated to the fields are found with their corresponding conserved
quantities. The behavior of these quantities under a galilean transformation
suggest the association of the fields with a quantum mechanical free particle.
An external potential is introduced in the Lagrange formalism. The description
is equivalent to the conventional Schr\""odinger equation treatment of a
particle. We discuss the attempts to build an interpretation of quantum
mechanics based on this scheme. The fields become the primary onthology of the
theory and the particles appear as emergent properties of the fields. These
interpretations face serious problems for systems with many degrees of freedom.

bound for the deformation parameter of the Heisenberg algebra.
