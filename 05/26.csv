bright SAX event, GRB 990510. The well-sampled optical decay, together with the
radio observations are inconsistent with simple spherical afterglow models. The
achromatic optical steepening and the decay of the radio afterglow both
occuring at $t \sim 1$ day are evidence for hydrodynamical evolution of the
source, and can be most easily interpreted by models where the GRB ejecta are
collimated in a jet. Employing a simple jet model to interpret the
observations, we derive a jet opening angle of $\theta_o = 0.08$, reducing the
isotropic gamma-ray emission of $2.9 \times 10^{53}$ erg by a factor $\sim
300$. If the jet interpretation is correct, we conclude that GRB observations
to-date are consistent with an energy for the central source of $E \lsim
10^{52}$ erg.

has been considered strong evidence for their cosmological origin. However,
subclasses of gamma-ray bursts have been shown to have significantly more
homogeneous brightness distributions. Pendleton et al. (1997) have found such a
result for gamma-ray bursts with no detectable emission at energies >300 keV.
Accordingly, it has been suggested that these no high energy (NHE) emission
bursts represent an underluminous population of nearby sources. A distinct
homogeneous NHE brightness distribution has also been considered as evidence
for beaming of different spectral components of the prompt burst emission. We
synthesize observed distributions of gamma-ray bursts based on a sample of
typical bright BATSE bursts with intrinsic high energy emission and adopt a
single cosmological distance scale for all sources. We find that the resulting
synthetic NHE bursts do indeed have a more nearly homogeneous intensity
distribution when an appropriate decrease in signal to noise and redshifted
spectrum is incorporated. We argue that the definition of NHE bursts, and
soft-spectrum bursts in general, naturally produces a steep distribution. The
NHE class of gamma-ray bursts is therefore likely due to brightness bias.

system suggests that massive clusters may begin to form at redshifts
considerably greater than unity. This scenario is supported by the high degree
of optical and X-ray substructure in ClJ0152.7-1357, which is similarly complex
as that of other X-ray selected distant clusters and consistent with the
picture of cluster formation by mass infall along large-scale filaments. X-ray
emission from ClJ0152.7-1357 was detected already in 1980 with the EINSTEIN
IPC. However, because the complex morphology of the emission caused its
significance to be underestimated, the corresponding source was not included in
the EMSS cluster sample and hence not previously identified. Simulations of the
EMSS source detection and selection procedure suggest a general bias of the
EMSS against X-ray luminous clusters with pronounced substructure. If highly
unrelaxed, merging clusters are common at high redshift, they could create a
bias in some samples as the morphological complexity of mergers may cause them
to fall below the flux limit of surveys that assume a unimodal spatial source
geometry. Conversely, the enhanced X-ray luminosity of mergers might cause them
to, temporarily, rise above the flux limit. Either effect could lead to
erroneous conclusions about the evolution of the comoving cluster space
density. A high fraction of morphologically complex clusters at high redshift

of 22 ``narrow-line'' Seyfert 1 galaxies for which data are available from the
ASCA public archive. Many of these sources, which were selected on the basis of
their relatively narrow H-beta line width (FWHM <= 2000 km/s), show significant
spectral complexity in the X-ray band. Their measured hard power-law continua
have photon indices spanning the range 1.6 - 2.5 with a mean of 2.1, which is
only slightly steeper than the norm for ``broad-line'' Seyfert 1s. All but four
of the sources exhibit a soft excess, which can be modelled as blackbody
emission (T_{bb} ~ 100 - 300 eV) superposed on the underlying power-law. This
soft component is often so strong that, even in the relatively hard bandpass of
ASCA, it contains a significant fraction, if not the bulk, of the X-ray
luminosity, apparently ruling out models in which the soft excess is produced
entirely through reprocessing of the hard continuum.
  Most notably, 6 of the 22 objects show evidence for a broad absorption
feature centred in the energy range 1.1 - 1.4 keV, which could be the signature
of resonance absorption in highly ionized material. A further 3 sources exhibit
``warm absorption'' edges in the 0.7 - 0.9 keV bandpass. Remarkably, all 9
``absorbed'' sources have H-beta line widths below 1000 km/s, which is less
than the median value for the sample taken as a whole. This tendency for very
narrow line widths to correlate with the presence of ionized absorption
features in the soft X-ray spectra of NLS1s, if confirmed in larger samples,
may provide a further clue in the puzzle of active galactic nuclei.

the Galactic center (GC) using Fokker-Planck models. CYCs are very young (< 5
Myr), compact (< 1 pc), and only a few tens of pc away from the GC, while they
appear to be as massive as the smallest Galactic globular clusters (~10^4
Msun). A survey of cluster lifetimes for various initial mass functions,
cluster masses, and galactocentric radii is presented. Short relaxation times
due to the compactness of CYCs, and the strong tidal fields near the GC make
clusters evaporate fairly quickly. Depending on cluster parameters, mass
segregation may occur on a time scale shorter than the lifetimes of most
massive stars, which accelerates the cluster's dynamical evolution even more.
When the difference between the upper and lower mass boundaries of the initial
mass function is large enough, strongly selective ejection of lighter stars
makes massive stars dominate even in the outer regions of the cluster, so the
dynamical evolution of those clusters is weakly dependent on the lower mass
boundary. The mass bins for Fokker-Planck simulations were carefully chosen to
properly account for a relatively small number of the most massive stars. We
find that clusters with a mass <~ 2x10^4 Msun evaporate in <~ 10 Myr. A simple
calculation based on the total masses in observed CYCs and the lifetimes
obtained here indicates that the massive CYCs comprise only a fraction of the
star formation rate (SFR) in the inner bulge estimated from Lyman continuum

  Astrophysical Journal on May 25, 1999",,"10.1086/307871",,"astro-ph",,"  We present an exploration of the significance of Carbon/Oxygen phase
separation in white dwarf stars in the context of self-consistent evolutionary
calculations. Because phase separation can potentially increase the calculated
ages of the oldest white dwarfs, it can affect the age of the Galactic disk as
derived from the downturn in the white dwarf luminosity function. We find that
the largest possible increase in ages due to phase separation is 1.5 Gyr, with
a most likely value of approximately 0.6 Gyr, depending on the parameters of
our white dwarf models.
  The most important factors influencing the size of this delay are the total
stellar mass, the initial composition profile, and the phase diagram assumed
for crystallization. We find a maximum age delay in models with masses of 0.6
solar masses, which is near the peak in the observed white dwarf mass
distribution. We find that varying the opacities (via the metallicity) has
little effect on the calculated age delays.
  In the context of Galactic evolution, age estimates for the oldest Galactic
globular clusters range from 11.5 to 16 Gyr, and depend on a variety of
parameters. In addition, a 4 to 6 Gyr delay is expected between the formation
of the globular clusters and that of the Galactic thin disk, while the observed
white dwarf luminosity function gives an age estimate for the thin disk of 9.5
+/-1.0 Gyr, without including the effect of phase separation. Using the above
numbers, we see that phase separation could add between 0 to 3 Gyr to the white
dwarf ages and still be consistent with the overall picture of Galaxy
formation. Our calculated maximum value of 1.5 Gyr fits within these bounds, as
does our best guess value of 0.6 Gyr.

lobes are less than 10^7 years old. This means that high-redshift radio
galaxies can be used as a high-time-resolution probe of evolution in the early
Universe. Moreover, this result helps to explain many observed trends of
radio-galaxy properties with redshift [(i) the `alignment effect' of optical
emission along radio-jet axes, (ii) the increased distortion in radio
structure, (iii) the decrease in physical sizes, (iv) the increase in radio
depolarisation, and (v) the increase in dust emission] without needing to
invoke explanations based on cosmology or strong evolution of the surrounding
intergalactic medium with cosmic time, thereby avoiding conflict with current
theories of structure formation.

forbidden line of NII. All this agrees well with the formation of relativistic
jets in the burst. It was concluded that the burst resulted in destruction of
external stationary accretion disk regions. The peak X-ray luminosity is about
10E+37 erg/s at the adopted distance of 1 kpc. It is well below the Eddington

through intermediates. The stretching rates of individual molecules show great

increase exponentially with force f till an optimum value which is determined

the lamellae transform smoothly from one orientation to the other, creating the
chevron morphology. As $\theta$ increases, a gradual transition is observed to
an omega morphology characterized by a protrusion of the lamellae along the

transition at $T_{N} \approx {20.0 K}$, followed by a dramatic slowing down of
the dynamics at low temperatures. The latter described by a pure Arrhenius law.
The effect of a superposed dc-field on the antiferromagnetic phase transition
and on the low-temperature dynamics is investigated, and a comprehensive static
and dynamic phase diagram in the H-T plane is derived. In agreement with
earlier results on the same system, $T_{N}(H)$ follows a random-exchange Ising
model to random-field Ising model crossover scaling for fields $H \leq 1.5 T$.
A random-field induced glassy dynamics appears for higher values of H, where
the antiferromagnetic phase transition is destroyed. The low-temperature

tunneling and consequent particle production, to the case of finite
temperature. Using the mathematical equivalence between, the Euclidean path
integral of a $\phi^4 - \phi^2$ quantum field theory (in the saddle point
approximation), on one hand, and the partition function of a 4-dimensional
ferromagnet (in the Ising model approximation), on the other, we derive the
following results. Tunneling is a first order phase transition. The creation of
metastable bound states of instanton-antinstanton pairs under the barrier
,(i.e. resonant tunneling), is the seed that gives rise to particle production.
Through the application of the Lee-Yang theorem for phase transitions, (as well
as demonstrating the underlying connection this has with the poles of the
S-matrix element in the quantum scattering theory), we show that the
fluctuations around the dominant escape paths of instantons (i.e. fluctuations
of the bubble wall) with momenta comparable to the scale curvature of the
bubble, drive the mechanism for resonant tunneling in false vacuum decay. We
also identify the temperature dependence of the parameters in the potential
term, (or equivalently, of the instanton bubbles), for a wide range of
temperatures Finally, we show that the picture of a dilute instanton
gas,remains valid even at finite temperatures, as this gas becomes more and
more dilute with the increase of the temperature. This suppression continues
until we reach the critical temperature, at which point there is only one
instanton left, with an infinitely thick wall.

neutralino, we present a detailed exploration of neutralino-stau coannihilation
channels, including analytical expressions and numerical results. We also
include neutralino coannihilations with the selectron and smuon. We evaluate
the implications of coannihilations for the cosmological relic density of the
LSP, which is assumed to be stable, in the constrained minimal supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model (CMSSM), in which the soft
supersymmetry-breaking parameters are universal at the supergravity GUT scale.
We evaluate the changes due to coannihilations in the region of the MSSM
parameter space that is consistent with the cosmological upper limit on the
relic LSP density. In particular, we find that the upper limit on the mass of
the neutralino is increased from about 200 GeV to about 600 GeV in the CMSSM,
and estimate a qualitatively similar increase for gauginos in the general MSSM.

generally, 5-dimensional CR manifolds of hypersurface type) at uniformly Levi
degenerate points, i.e. Levi degenerate points such that the rank of the Levi
form is constant in a neighborhood. We also require the hypersurface to satisfy
a certain second order nondegeneracy condition (called 2-nondegeneracy) at the
point. Our first result is the construction of a principal bundle $P\to M$ with
an absolute parallelism, uniquely determined by the CR structure on $M$, which
reduces the question of whether two such CR manifolds $M$ and $M'$ are CR
equivalent to the corresponding equivalence problem for the parallelized
bundles $P$ and $P'$.
  A basic example of a hypersurface of the type under consideration is the tube
$\Gamma_\bC$ over the light cone. Our second result is the characterization of
$\Gamma_\bC$ by vanishing curvature conditions in the spirit of the
characterization of the unit sphere as the flat model for strongly pseudoconvex

different propagation velocities along the birefringence axes. We show that the

related to the unequal propagation velocities of the modes along the
