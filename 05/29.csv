which agents with poorly performing strategies can trade in their strategies
for new ones from a different strategy space. In the context of the games
discussed in this paper, this means allowing for strategies that use
information from different numbers of time lags, m. We find, in all the games
we study, that after evolution, wealth per agent is high for agents with
strategies drawn from small strategy spaces (small m), and low for agents with
strategies drawn from large strategy spaces (large m). In the game played with
N agents, wealth per agent as a function of m is very nearly a step function.
The transition is at m=mt, where mt~mc-1. Here mc is the critical value of m at
which N agents playing the game with a fixed strategy space (fixed m) have the
best emergent coordination and the best utilization of resources. We also find
that overall system-wide utilization of resources is independent of N.
Furthermore, although overall system-wide utilization of resources after
evolution varies somewhat depending on some other aspects of the evolutionary
dynamics, in the best cases, utilization of resources is on the order of the
best results achieved in evolutionary games with fixed strategy spaces. Simple
explanations are presented for some of our main results.

1987 outburst of the same source observed by Ginga was much brighter, and
showed a high/soft spectral state. In contrast the 1997-1998 outburst showed a
low/hard spectral state. Both states are typical for black hole binaries. The
RXTE All Sky Monitor observed an outburst duration of 150 to 200 days. PCA and
HEXTE observations covered ~70 days near the maximum of the light curve and
during the flux decline. Throughout the observations, the spectrum can be
approximated by Compton upscattering of soft photons by energetic electrons.
The hot electron cloud has a temperature kT ~30 keV and optical depth tau~4--5.
To fit the data well an additional iron fluorescent line and reflection
component are required, which indicates the presence of optically thick cool
material, most probably in the outer part of the accretion disk. Dramatic fast
variability was observed, and has been analyzed in the context of a shot noise
model. The spectrum appeared to be softest at the peaks of the shot-noise
variability. The shape of the power spectrum was typical for black hole systems
in a low/hard state. We note a qualitative difference in the shape of the
dependence of fractional variability on energy, when we compare systems with
black holes and with neutron stars. Since it is difficult to discriminate these
systems on spectral grounds, at least in their low/hard states, this new
difference might be important.

is a low-frequency (151 MHz) selected sample with a flux-density limit about
25-times fainter than the 3CRR sample. By combining these samples, we can for
the first time distinguish whether the correlations present are controlled by
151 MHz radio luminosity L_151 or redshift z. We find unequivocal evidence that
the dominant effect is a strong positive correlation between narrow line
luminosity L_NLR and L_151, of the form L_NLR proportional to L_151 ^ 0.79 +/-
0.04. Correlations of L_NLR with redshift or radio properties, such as linear
size or 151 MHz (rest-frame) spectral index, are either much weaker or absent.
We use simple assumptions to estimate the total bulk kinetic power Q of the
jets in FRII radio sources, and confirm the underlying proportionality between
jet power and narrow line luminosity first discussed by Rawlings & Saunders
(1991). We make the assumption that the main energy input to the narrow line
region is photoionisation by the quasar accretion disc, and relate Q to the
disc luminosity, Q_phot. We find that 0.05 < Q / Q_phot < 1 so that the jet
power is within about an order of magnitude of the accretion disc luminosity.
The most powerful radio sources are accreting at rates close to the Eddington
limit of supermassive black holes (~ 10^9 - 10^10 solar masses), whilst lower
power sources are accreting at sub-Eddington rates.

greatly reduced. The spin polarisation induced by magnetic impurities has an
oscillatory behaviour reflecting the existing AF correlations between the Cu
spins. Its influence on the NMR spectra opens a way to determine the q
dependence of the static spin susceptibility and the T dependence of the AF
correlation length. NMR measurements demonstrate that non-magnetic impurities
such as Zn induce a local moment behaviour on the neighbouring Cu sites. This
magnetism revealed by spin-less sites can be understood on theoretical grounds
in the case of undoped quantum spin systems, while here the carriers greatly
complicate the situation. Susceptibility data show that the magnitude of the
local moment decreases with increasing hole doping. This experimental evidence
directly reflects the influence of AF correlations and the interference between
the carriers and the Cu hole spins in the cuprates. The anomalously large
scattering of the carriers on spinless defects is another indication of the
originality of the electronic properties of the cuprates, which apparently

striking non-Fermi liquid behavior: R_H follows a Curie-Weiss type temperature
dependence, and |R_H|>>1/|ne| at low temperatures in the under-doped compounds.
Moreover, R_H is positive for hole-doped compounds and is negative for
electron-doped ones, although each of them has a similar hole-like Fermi
surface. In this paper, we give the explanation of this long-standing problem
from the standpoint of the nearly antiferromagnetic (AF) Fermi liquid. We
consider seriously the vertex corrections for the current which are
indispensable to satisfy the conservation laws, which are violated within the
conventional Boltzmann transport approximation. The obtained total current J_k
takes an enhanced value and is no more perpendicular to the Fermi surface due
to the strong AF fluctuations. By virtue of this mechanism, the anomalous
behavior of R_H in high-Tc cuprates is neutrally explained. We find that both
the temperature and the (electron, or hole) doping dependences of R_H in
high-T_c cuprates are reproduced well by numerical calculations based on the
fluctuation-exchange (FLEX) approximation, applied to the single-band Hubbard
model. We also discuss the temperature dependence of R_H in other nearly AF
metals, e.g., V_2O_3, kappa-BEDT-TTF organic superconductors, and heavy fermion
systems close to the AF phase boundary.

remarkable temperature dependence, and its absolute value is enhanced in
comparison with that value simply estimated on the basis of band structure. It
has been recognized that this temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient is
due to highly anisotropic quasiparticle damping rate on the Fermi surface. In
this paper we further take account of the vertex correction to the current
vertex arising from quasiparticle interactions. Then the transport current is
transformed to a large extent from the quasiparticle velocity, and is no longer
proportional to the latter. As a consequence some pieces of the Fermi surface
outside of the antiferromagnetic Brillouin zone make negative contribution to
the Hall conductivity, even if the curvature of the Fermi surface is hole-like.
The Hall coefficient is much larger at low temperatures than the estimate made
without the vertex correction. Temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic
spin correlation length is also crucial to cause remarkable temperature
dependence of the Hall coefficient. In our treatment the Hall coefficient of
the electron-doped cuprates can be negative despite hole-like curvature of the
Fermi surface.

diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. By direct comparison with the two-body
response functions and with the exact solution of the Bethe Ansatz equations,
we can identify both spinon and holon features in the spectra. At half-filling
the spectra have the well-known structure of a low energy holon band and its
shadow---which span the whole Brillouin zone---and a spinon band present for
momenta less than the Fermi momentum. New features related to the twisted
boundary condition are cusps in the spinon band. We show that the spectral
building principle, adapted to account for both the finite system size and the
twisted boundary condition, describes the spectra well in terms of single
spinon and holon excitations. We argue that these finite-size effects are a
signature of spin-charge separation and that their study should help establish
the existence and nature of spin-charge separation in finite-size systems.

fractional charges of strength 1/N_c. Furthermore, the creation operator which
inserts the magnetic charge in the CG picture is explicitly constructed and

isolated fixed points for the symmetries is no longer adequate, because it
would imply the Levi-flatness.
  Among all symmetric CR-manifolds we distinguish a large subclass consisting
of all Shilov boundaries of bounded symmetric domains. For this class we
calculate the polynomial and the rational convex hulls Both hulls are
canonically stratified into real-analytic CR-submanifolds such that the
(unique) stratum of the highest dimension is complex for the polynomial and
Levi-flat for the rational convex hull. It is also proved that the CR-functions
extend continuously to the rational convex hull such that the extension is CR
on every stratum.
