distribution seems to exhibit a more complex structure characterized by several
longer branches running almost parallel to each other across the UV-plane. By
using the wavelet transform technique to analyse the distribution, the branches

They are roughly equidistant with a separation of about 15 km/s for early-type

transform. This branch-like velocity distribution might be due to the galactic

number violating in supersymmetric SU(5+N) (N=0, 1,...) GUTs. The mechanism is
realized through suppression of qqT type couplings, and is implemented by
introducing new `matter' multiplets belonging to symmetric representations of
SU(5+N). Together with the suppression of nucleon decay, these multiplets also
enable one to avoid the unwanted asymptotic mass relations $m_s=m_{\mu}$,
$\frac{m_d}{m_s}=\frac{m_e}{m_{\mu}}$.
  As an example, we consider a SU(6) model with pseudo-Goldstone Higgs. By
supplementing the model with an anomalous ${\cal U}(1)$ flavor symmetry, we
also obtain a simple `all-order' solution of the gauge hierarchy problem and
natural explanation of charged fermion mass hierarchies and values of the CKM
matrix elements. The proton life time $\tau_p\sim 10^{2}\tau_p^{SU(5)}$~yr. is
compatible with experiments, with the dominant decay being $p\to K\nu_{\mu,
\tau}$. Thanks to the SU(6) symmetry, successful unification of the gauge
couplings can be retained, and the value of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(M_Z)$
can be reduced to $\simeq 0.12$.
  Finally, we show how to accommodate the solar and atmospheric neutrino data
through the bi-maximal neutrino mixing scenario, with maximal vacuum
$\nu_e-\nu_{\mu, \tau}$ and large angle $\nu_{\mu}-\nu_{\tau}$ oscillations.

problem of quantum irreversibility. By adding the divergence of a
gauge-invariant current, G_n can be extended to a new notion of Euler density,
linear in the conformal factor. We call it pondered Euler density. This notion
relates the trace-anomaly coefficients a and a' of G_n and Box^{n/2-1}R in a
universal way (a=a') and gives a formula expressing the total RG flow of a as
the invariant area of the graph of the beta function between the fixed points.
I illustrate these facts in detail for n=6 and check the prediction to the
fourth-loop order in the phi^3-theory. The formula of quantum irreversibility
for general n even can be extended to n odd by dimensional continuation.
Although the trace anomaly in external gravity is zero in odd dimensions, I
show that the odd-dimensional formula has a predictive content.

capability to apply weak formulations via integration by parts, which leads to
elements matching at lower degree of continuity and relaxes requirements of
choosing basis functions. However, when applied to nonlinear problems, the
methods of this type require a great amount of computing effort of repeated
numerical integration. It is well known that the method of weighted residual is
the very basis of various popular numerical techniques including the FE and
Galerkin methods. This paper presents a novel methodology of weighted residual
for nonlinear computation with objectives to avoid the above-mentioned
shortcomings. It is shown that the presented nonlinear formulations of the FE
and Galerkin methods can be expressed in the Hadamard product form as in the
collocation and finite difference methods. Therefore, the recently developed
SJT product approach can be applied in the evaluation of the Jacobian matrix of
these nonlinear formulations. This also provides possibility to introduce the
nonlinear uncoupling technique to the FE and Galerkin nonlinear computing.
Furthermore, the present scheme of weighted residuals also greatly eases the
use of the least square and boundary element methods to nonlinear problems

description (of which both Lagrangian and Eulerian descriptions are special
cases) of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid is used. Such a description
enables a distorting finite element mesh to be used for the deforming fluid
domain.
  A new scheme for the linearised approximation of the convective term is
proposed and the improved, second order accuracy of this scheme is proved. A
second theorem, which provides a guideline for the artificial adjustment of the
Reynolds number when applying a continuation technique, is also proved. The
most effective means of eliminating pressure as a variable and enforcing
incompressibility are reviewed. A somewhat novel method to generate finite
element meshes automatically about included rigid bodies, and which involves
finite element mappings, is described.
  The approach taken when approximating the free surface, is that it may be
treated as a material entity, that is, the material derivative of the free
surface is assumed zero. Euler's equations and conservation of linear momentum
are used to determine the motion of the rigid body. A predictor-corrector
method is used to solve the combined sub-problems. The resulting model is
tested in the context of a driven cavity flow, a driven cavity flow with
various, included rigid bodies, a die-swell problem, and a Stokes second order
