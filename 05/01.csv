Plutinos with eccentricities close to Pluto (fractional eccentricity difference

manner similar to the tadpole and horseshoe libration in coorbital satellites.
Plutinos with |e-e_p|/e_p>=0.3 can also be stable; the longitude difference
circulates and close encounters are possible, but the effects of Pluto are weak
because the encounter velocity is high. Orbits with intermediate eccentricity

line emission [OIII], H-alpha, and [SII], and in continuum U, V, R. For
NGC5253, line ratio maps [OIII]/H-beta and [SII]/H-alpha show that in the outer
regions the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) is partially excited by a
non-photoionization process (`shocks'). The `shocked' gas is mostly
concentrated south-west of the galaxy's center, in coincidence with the
position of H-alpha bubbles and with extended soft X-ray emission. The H-alpha
emission from the shock-excited gas is ~1-2% of the total. About 80-90% of the
DIG is consistent with being photoionized, requiring that about 10% of the
ionizing photons escape from the starburst site. The starburst in NGC5253
appears to be fed by gas infalling along the galaxy's optical minor axis, while
hot gas expanding from the starburst has a preferential direction along the
major axis. The results for NGC5236 are less clear than for NGC5253, as the
images are not as deep. The emission line ratio maps show very little or no
evidence for presence of shock excitation and very little or no ionized gas
appears expanding from the center of the galaxy outward along the disk plane.
The starburst in NGC5236 is thus more strongly confined than that in NGC5253,
probably due to the deeper gravitational potential well of the more massive
galaxy.

clumping factor C = <rho^2>/<rho>^2 between 1.3 and 1.4 within a density
contrast of 500 times the critical density. These fluctuations arise from the
cluster history of accretion shocks and major mergers, and their presence
enhances the cluster's luminosity relative to the smooth case. We expect,
therefore, that ICM mass measurements utilizing models which assume uniform
density at a given radius carry a bias of order sqrt(C) = 1.16. We verify this
result by performing ICM mass measurements on X-ray images of the simulations
and finding the expected level of bias.
  The varied cluster morphologies in our ensemble also allow us to investigate
the effects of departures from spherical symmetry on our measurements. We find
that the presence of large-scale substructure does not further bias the
resulting gas mass unless it is pronounced enough to produce a second peak in
the image of at least 1% the maximum surface brightness. We analyze the subset

that dictate the profile of unification in different models. We use them to
study under what conditions unification of couplings can occur in both one and

interesting intermediate scale models with gauge coupling unification such as
the minimal left-right models with the seesaw mechanism with a $M_{W_R}\sim

  Theorem 1. Suppose that p >= 5. Suppose also that \rho:G_\Q -> GL_2(O_L) is a
continuous representation satisfying the following conditions.
  1. \rho ramifies at only finitely many primes.
  2. \rho mod \lambda is modular and absolutely irreducible.
  3. \rho is unramified at p and \rho(Frob_p) has eigenvalues \alpha and \beta
with distinct reductions modulo \lambda.
  Then there exists a classical weight one eigenform
  f = \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_m(f) q^m

a_q(f)=tr(\rho(\Frob_q)). In particular \rho has finite image and for any

semistable arises from a modular form. The main theorem of Wiles establishes
this modularity when the representation in question satisfies various technical
restrictions, together with the key hypothesis that its reduction modulo p
arises itself from a modular form. This article explains how a strong version
of Wiles' ""lifting theorem"" implies the modularity of all hypergeometric
abelian varieties - so-called because their periods are expressed in terms of
values of classical hypergeometric functions. While this strong version remains
unproved, various strengthenings of Wiles' original result, notably those
arising from work of Wiles and Skinner, allow one to unconditionally establish
the modularity of infinite collections of hypergeometric abelian varieties.

and others is a method for comparing homotopy types of topological spaces with
diffeomorphism or homeomorphism types of manifolds of dimension >= 5. In this
paper, a modification of this theory is presented, where instead of fixing a
homotopy type one considers a weaker information. Roughly speaking, one
compares n-dimensional compact manifolds with topological spaces whose
k-skeletons are fixed, where k is at least [n/2]. A particularly attractive
example which illustrates the concept is given by complete intersections. By
the Lefschetz hyperplane theorem, a complete intersection of complex dimension
n has the same n-skeleton as CP^n and one can use the modified theory to obtain
information about their diffeomorphism type although the homotopy
classification is not known. The theory reduces this classification result to
the determination of complete intersections in a certain bordism group. The
restrictions are: If d = d_1 ... d_r is the total degree of a complete
intersection X^n_{d_1,..., d_r} of complex dimension n, then the assumption is,
that for all primes p with p(p-1) <= n+1, the total degree d is divisible by
p^{[(2n+1)/(2p-1)]+1}.
  Theorem A. Two complete intersections X^n_{d_1,.,d_r} and X^n_{d'_1,\ldots ,
d'_s} of complex dimension n>2 fulfilling the assumption above for the total
degree are diffeomorphic if and only if the total degrees, the Pontrjagin
classes and the Euler characteristics agree.

E in R^n is purely unrectifiable if for any Lipschitz function gamma from R to

countable family of Lipschitz functions gamma_i from R to R^n such that H^1(E -
union gamma_i(R)) = 0. It may be seen from this definition that any 1-set E
(that is, E Borel and 0<H^1(E)<\infty) can be decomposed into two disjoint
subsets E_irr and E_rect, where E_irr is purely unrectifiable and E_rect is

for joinings of full entropy on \T^\N. In conjunction with a method of Host,
this yields the following. Denote \sig_q(x) = qx\pmod{1}. Then for every
p-invariant ergodic \mu with positive entropy,
\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}\sig_{c_n}\mu converges weak^* to Lebesgue measure

u,d-quarks while the $\zeta, \phi$ mean fields are coupled to the s-quark. The
coupling constants of the mean fields with the quarks are assumed to satisfy
SU(6) symmetry. The calculations take into account the medium dependence of the
bag parameter on the scalar fields $\sigma, \zeta$. We consider only the octet
baryons $N,\Lambda,\Sigma,\Xi$ in hypernuclear matter. An ideal gas of the
strange mesons $K$ and $K^{*}$ is introduced to keep zero net strangeness
density. Our results for symmetric hypernuclear matter show that a phase
transition takes place at a critical temperature around 180 MeV in which the
scalar mean fields $\sigma, \zeta$ take nonzero values at zero baryon density.
Furthermore, the bag contants of the baryons decrease significantly at and
above this critical temperature indicating the onset of quark deconfinement.
The present results imply that the onset of quark deconfinement in SU(3)
hypernuclear matter is much stronger than in SU(2) nuclear matter.
