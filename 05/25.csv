quasi-stellar objects (BAL QSOs). The continuum, absorption trough, and
emission line polarization of BAL QSOs yield clues about their structure. We
confirm that BAL QSOs are in general more highly polarized than non-BAL QSOs,
consistent with a more equatorial viewing direction for the former than the
latter. We have identified two new highly-polarized QSOs in our sample
(1232+1325 and 1333+2840). The polarization rises weakly to the blue in most
objects, perhaps due to scattering and absorption by dust particles. We find
that a polarization increase in the BAL troughs is a general property of
polarized BAL QSOs, indicating an excess of scattered light relative to direct
light, and consistent with the unification of BAL QSOs and non-BAL QSOs. We
have also discovered evidence of resonantly scattered photons in the red wing
of the C IV broad emission lines of a few objects. In most cases, the broad
emission lines have lower polarization and a different position angle than the
continuum. The polarization characteristics of low-ionization BAL QSOs are
similar to those of high-ionization BAL QSOs, suggesting a similar BAL wind
geometry.

Ionized gas is present over a huge spread in velocity (1100 km/s) in the disk
of NGC 1144, but HI emission is detected over only 1/3 of this velocity range,
in an area that corresponds to the NW half of the disk. In the nuclear region
of NGC 1144, a jump in velocity in the ionized gas component of 600 km/s is
observed. Faint, narrow HI absorption lines are also detected against radio
sources in the SE part of the disk of NGC 1144, which includes regions of
massive star formation and a Seyfert nucleus. The peculiar HI distribution,
which is concentrated in the NW disk, seems to be the inverse of the molecular
distribution which is concentrated in the SE disk. Although this may partly be
the result of the destruction of HI clouds in the SE disk, there is
circumstantial evidence that the entire HI emission spectrum of NGC 1144 is
affected by a deep nuclear absorption line covering a range of 600 km/s, and is
likely blueshifted with respect to the nucleus. In this picture, a high
column-density HI stream is associated with the nuclear ionized gas velocity
discontinuity, and the absorption effectively masks any HI emission that would
be present in the SE disk of NGC 1144.

most powerful phenomena in the Universe, releasing electromagnetic energy
approaching the rest-mass energy of a neutron star in a few seconds. The two
currently popular models for GRB progenitors are the coalescence of two compact
objects (such as neutron stars or black holes) or collapse of a massive star.
An unavoidable consequence of the latter model is that a bright supernovae
should accompany the GRB. The emission from this supernova competes with the
much brighter afterglow produced by the relativistic shock that gives rise to
the GRB itself. Here we present evidence for an unusual light curve for GRB
980326 based on new optical observations. The transient brightened ~3 weeks
after the burst to a flux sixty times larger than that extrapolated from the
rapid decay seen at early time. Furthermore, the spectrum changed dramatically
and became extremely red. We argue that the new source is the underlying
supernova. If our hypothesis is true then this would be the first evidence for
a supernova connection with GRBs at cosmological distances. We suggest that
GRBs with long durations are associated with death of massive stars.

steepening decay, independent of wavelength, approaching asymptotically
$t^{-0.76\pm 0.01}$ at early times ($t\ll 1 day)$ and $t^{-2.40\pm 0.02}$ at
late times, with the break time at $t_0=1.57\pm 0.03 days$. GRB 990510 is the
most rapidly fading of the well-documented GRB afterglows. It is also the first
observed example of broad-band break for a GRB optical counterpart. The optical
spectral energy distribution, corrected for significant Galactic reddening, is
well fitted by a single power-law with $\nu^{-0.61\pm 0.12}$. However, when the
$B$-band point is dropped from the fit, the power-law becomes $\nu^{-0.46\pm
0.08}$, indicating a possible deviation from the power-law in the spectrum,
either intrinsic or due to additional extinction near the source or from an
intervening galaxy at $z=1.62$. Broad-band break behavior broadly similar to
that observed in GRB 990510 has been predicted in some jet models of GRB

  available from http://www-astro.phast.umass.edu/~weinberg/weinberg-pubs.html",,"10.1086/308600",,"astro-ph",,"  A combination of analytic models and n-body simulations implies that the
structural evolution of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is dominated by its
dynamical interaction with the Milky Way. Although expected at some level, the
scope of the involvement has significant observational consequences. First, LMC
disk orbits are torqued out of the disk plane, thickening the disk and
populating a spheroid. The torque results from direct forcing by the Milky Way
tide and, indirectly, from the drag between the LMC disk and its halo resulting
from the induced precession of the LMC disk. The latter is a newly reported
mechanism that can affect all satellite interations. However, the overall
torque can not isotropize the stellar orbits and their kinematics remains
disk-like. Such a kinematic signature is observed for nearly all LMC
populations. The extended disk distribution is predicted to increase the
microlensing toward the LMC. Second, the disk's binding energy slowly decreases
during this process, puffing up and priming the outer regions for subsequent
tidal stripping. Because the tidally stripped debris will be spatially
extended, the distribution of stripped stars is much more extended than the HI
Magellanic Stream. This is consistent with upper limits to stellar densities in
the gas stream and suggests a different strategy for detecting the stripped
stars. And, finally, the mass loss over several LMC orbits is predicted by
n-body simulation and the debris extends to tens of kiloparsecs from the tidal
boundary. Although the overall space density of the stripped stars is low,
possible existence of such intervening populations have been recently reported
and may be detectable using 2MASS.

formation in the central part of the galaxy. We have performed an analysis of
the structural parameters of Phoenix based on an ESO/SRC scanned plate, in
order to search for differentiated component. The results were then used to
obtain the color-magnitude diagrams for three different regions of Phoenix in
order to study the variation of the properties of its stellar population. The
young population located in the central component of Phoenix shows a clear
asymmetry in its distribution, that could indicate a propagation of star
formation across the central component. The HI cloud found at 6 arcmin
Southwest by Young & Lo (1997) could have been involved in this process.
  We also find the presence of a substantial intermediate-age population in the
central region of Phoenix that would be less abundant or absent in its outer
regions. This result is also consistent with the gradient found in the number
of horizontal branch stars, whose frequency relative to red giant branch stars
increases towards the outer part of the galaxy. These results, together with
those of our morphological study, suggest the existence of an old, metal-poor
population with a spheroidal distribution surrounding the younger inner
component of Phoenix. This two-component structure may resemble the halo-disk
structure observed in spirals, although more data, in particular on kinematics,

are produced in star formation regions in distant galaxies by highly
relativistic jets that happen to point in our direction. Relativistic beaming
collimates the emission from the highly relativistic jets into small solid
angles along the jet direction. It implies that we are seeing only a small
fraction of the events that produce GRBs. The observed GRB rate then requires
an event rate which is comparable to the birth rate of neutron stars (NS). The
highly relativistic jets sweep up ambient matter along their trajectories,
accelerate it to cosmic ray (CR) energies and disperse it in hot spots which
they form when they stop in the galactic halo. With an event rate comparable to
the NS birth rate, such events in our Galaxy may be the main source of Galactic
cosmic rays at all energies. Internal interactions and/or external interactions
of these jets with high column density matter and/or radiation at their
production sites or along their trajectories can produce high energy gamma rays
and neutrinos that are highly beamed along the jet direction. Jetted GRBs, like
blazars, may be much more fluent in high energy gamma rays and neutrinos than
in MeV gamma rays. But, TeV gamma rays from large cosmological distances are
unobservable because of their attenuation by electron-positron pair creation on
the intergalactic infrared background radiation. However, high energy neutrinos
from distant GRBs may be observed with large surface/volume telescopes which
are under construction. TeV gamma rays and high energy neutrinos may also be
detected from relatively nearby GRBs by the existing moderate size detectors,

resonance peak should remain sharp even when the temperature is comparable or
greater than the peak frequency. This result agrees qualitatively with recent
experimental observations of the ac conductivity in two-dimensional hole
systems in a magnetically induced insulating state. It is shown, in analogy
with Kohn's theorem, that the electron-electron interaction does not affect the
response of a harmonically pinned Wigner crystal to a spatially uniform
external field at any temperature. We thus focus on anharmonicity in the
pinning potential as a source of broadening. Using a 1/N expansion technique,
we show that the broadening is introduced through the self-energy corrections

channel Kondo model. We first use an argument based on conformal field theory
to establish this precise equivalence with the two channel model. We then use
the numerical renormalization group (NRG) approach to calculate both
one-electron and two-electron response functions for a range of values of the
interaction strength U. We compare the behaviours about the marginal Fermi
liquid and Fermi liquid fixed points and interpret the results in terms of a
renormalized Majorana fermion picture of the elementary excitations. In the
marginal Fermi liquid case the spectral densities of all the Majorana fermion
modes display a |omega| dependence on the lowest energy scale, and in addition
the zero Majorana mode has a delta function contribution. The weight of this
delta function is studied as a function of the interaction U and is found to
decrease exponentially with U for large U. Using the equivalence with the two
channel Kondo model in the large U limit, we deduce the dynamical spin
susceptibility of the two channel Kondo model over the full frequency range. We
use renormalized perturbation theory to interpret the results and to calculate

effect of fluctuations and the inherent ultraviolet divergences. We determine
the region of validity of the expansion around the saddle point. We find that

Hilbert space formalism as does the statistical ensemble interpretation (SQM).
This leads to the well-known paradoxes surrounding the Measurement Problem. We
extend this common mathematical structure to encompass certain natural bundles
with connections over the Hilbert sphere S. This permits a consistent extension
of the statistical interpretation to interacting individual systems, thereby
resolving these paradoxes.
  Suppose V is a physical system in interaction with another system W. The
state vector of V+W has a set of polar decompositions with a vector q of
complex coefficients. These are parameterized by the right toroid T of
amplitudes q, and comprise a singular toroidal bundle over S, which comprises
the enlarged state space of V+W. We prove that each T has a unique natural
convex partition yielding the correct SQM probabilities. In the extended theory
V and W synchronously assume pure spectral states according to which member of
the partition contains q. The apparent indeterminism of SQM is thus
attributable to the effectively random distribution of initial phases.

dimensional harmonic chain considered as a closed quantum mechanical system. By
comparing the properties of a family of coarse-grained descriptions of the
chain, we conclude that local coarse-grainings in this family are more useful
for prediction than nonlocal ones. A quantum mechanical system exhibits
classical behavior when the probability is high for histories having the
correlations in time implied by classical deterministic laws. But approximate
classical determinism holds only for certain coarse-grainings and then only if
the initial state of the system is suitably restricted. Coarse-grainings by the
values of the hydrodynamic variables (integrals over suitable volumes of
densities of approximately conserved quantities) define the histories usually
used in classical physics. But what distinguishes this coarse-graining from
others? This paper approaches this question by analyzing a family of
coarse-grainings for the linear harmonic chain. At one extreme in the family
the chain is divided into local groups of $N$ atoms. At the other extreme the
$N$ atoms are distributed nonlocally over the whole chain. Each coarse-graining
follows the average (center of mass) positions of the groups and ignores the
``internal'' coordinates within each group, these constituting a different
environment for each coarse-graining. We conclude that noise, decoherence, and
computational complexity favor locality over nonlocality for deterministic
predictability.

source is confined to the cavity, one can first of all integrate out the fields

Subsequently, one uses an expansion of the cavity field in terms of its
quasinormal modes (QNMs)-the exact, exponentially damped eigenstates of the
classical evolution operator, which previously have been shown to be complete
for a large class of models. Dissipation causes the effective cavity action to
be nondiagonal in the QNM basis. The inversion of this action matrix inherent
in the Gaussian path integral to obtain the generating functional is therefore
nontrivial, but can be accomplished by invoking a novel QNM sum rule. The
results are consistent with those obtained previously using canonical
quantization.

conditional measurement. Allowing for arbitrary quantum states of both the
input reference modes and the output reference modes on which the measurements
are performed, the setup is described within the concept of two-port
non-unitary transformation, and the overall non-unitary transformation operator
is derived. It is shown to be a product of operators, where each operator is
assigned to one of the beam splitters and can be expressed in terms of an
s-ordered operator product, with s being determined by the beam splitter
transmittance or reflectance. As an example we discuss the generation of and
