main astronomical photometrical bands with a resolution better than 3 km. The
aim is to understand the state of night sky pollution in Europe, to quantify
the present situation and to allow future monitoring of trends. The artificial
sky brightness in each site at a given position on the sky is obtained by the
integration of the contributions produced by every surface area in the
surroundings of the site. Each contribution is computed taking in account the
propagation in the atmosphere of the upward light flux emitted by the area and
measured from DMSP satellites. The project is a long term study in which we
plan to take in account successively of many different details in order to
improve the maps. We present, as a preliminary result, a map of the V-band
artificial sky brightness in Italy in 1998 and we compare it with the map
obtained 27 years earlier by Bertiau, Treanor and De Graeve. Predictions for
the artificial sky brightness within the next 27 years are also shown.

varies by at least a factor of ~4 among the complete halo sight lines thus far
studied. In addition to the high ion absorption, lines of low ionization

which may have a lower than expected abundance resulting from partial
photoionization of gas along the sight line, the absorption strengths are
typical of those expected for the warm, neutral interstellar medium. The sight
line intercepts a cold molecular cloud with log N(H2) ~ 19. The cloud has an

  Revised version, including some significant additions",,"10.1086/308167",,"astro-ph",,"  We present a new theoretical analysis of the PSR B1620-26 triple system in
the globular cluster M4, based on the latest radio pulsar timing data, which
now include measurements of five time derivatives of the pulse frequency. These
data allow us to determine the mass and orbital parameters of the second
companion completely (up to the usual unknown orbital inclination angle $i_2$).
The current best-fit parameters correspond to a second companion of planetary
mass, $m_2 \sin i_2 \simeq 7\times10^{-3} M_\odot$, in an orbit of eccentricity
$e_2\simeq 0.45$ and semimajor axis $a_2\simeq 60 $AU. Using numerical
scattering experiments, we study a possible formation scenario for the triple
system, which involves a dynamical exchange interaction between the binary
pulsar and a primordial star-planet system. The current orbital parameters of
the triple are consistent with such a dynamical origin, and suggest that the
separation of the parent star-planet system was very large, $\go 50 $AU. We
also examine the possible origin of the anomalously high eccentricity of the
inner binary pulsar. While this eccentricity could have been induced during the
same dynamical interaction that created the triple, we find that it could
equally well arise from long-term secular perturbation effects in the triple,
combining the general relativistic precession of the inner orbit with the
Newtonian gravitational perturbation of the planet. The detection of a planet
in this system may be taken as evidence that large numbers of extrasolar
planetary systems, not unlike those discovered recently in the solar
neighborhood, also exist in old star clusters.

kpc using the I-magnitude of the RGB tip. The main-sequence luminosity function
down to I ~25 provides evidence for a roughly constant SFR of approximately
0.00035 solar masses per year across the WFPC2 field of view (0.22 square kpc)
during the past 250-350 Myr. Structure in the blue loop luminosity function
implies that the SFR was ~50% higher 400-900 Myr ago than today. The mean heavy
element abundance of these young stars is 1/10th solar. The best explanation
for a red spur on the main-sequence at I = 24.7 is the blue horizontal branch
component of a very old stellar population at the center of IC 1613. We have
also imaged a broader area of IC 1613 using the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope under
excellent seeing conditions. The AGB-star luminosity function is consistent
with a period of continuous star formation over at least the age range 2-10
Gyr. We present an approximate age-metallicity relation for IC 1613, which

diagram of IC 1613 to similar data for three other Local Group dwarf galaxies,

We derive dust mass from optical extinction as well as from the far infrared

universe, which are thought to be powered by gas accretion onto a supermassive
black hole (SMBH). The dynamical effect exerted either by non-axisymmetric
gravitational potential (such as a stellar bar) or by interaction with other
galaxies has been often considered to cause the efficient gas fueling. However,
recent systematic studies for large samples of Seyfert nuclei have shown that;
1) Seyfert nuclei do not prefer barred galaxies as their hosts, and 2) only
$\simeq$ 10% of Seyfert galaxies have companion galaxies. These findings raise
again a question; ""What is important in the fueling of nuclear activity ?"" Here
we suggest that an alternative fueling mechanism, the minor-merger (i.e.,
mergers between a gas-rich disk galaxy and a bound, less-massive satellite
galaxy) driven fueling appears consistent with almost all important
observational properties of Seyfert galaxies. Nucleated (i.e., either a SMBH or
a dense nuclear star cluster) galaxies and satellites seem necessary to ensure
that the gas in the host disk is surely fueled into the very inner region
(e.g., $\ll$ 1 pc). Taking account that local quasars may be formed by major
mergers between/among galaxies, we propose that all the AGNs in the local
universe were made either by minor or by major mergers.

properties of the eight radio-selected cluster members and show that these

simplest interpretation of the radio emission from these galaxies is that they
are currently forming massive stars, contradicting their classification as
post-starburst systems based on the optical spectra. We suggest that this star
formation is hidden from view in the optical by the same obscuring dust which
is apparent in our comparison on the optical and near-infrared morphologies of

(Bertelli et al . 1994, Girardi et al. 1999). We find that the ages of these
clusters fall in the range 4 to 9-10 Gyr: Melotte 66 is the youngest whereas
NGC 6791 and Berkeley 17 have ages of about 9-10 Gyr. Previous estimates for
Berkeley 17 indicated an age as old as 12 Gyr, almost falling within the range
of classical globular clusters. In our analysis, this cluster is always very
old but perhaps somewhat younger than in previous studies. However we call
attention on the fact that the above ages are to be taken as provisional
estimates, because of the many uncertaintes still affecting stellar models in
the mass range 1.0 to 1.5 Mo. Despite this drawback of extant theory of stellar
structure, if NGC 6791 and Berkeley 17 set the limit to the age of the Galactic
Disk, this component of the Milky Way can be as old as 9-10 Gyr, but surely
younger than the Galactic Halo, at least as inferred from recent determinations
of the age of globular clusters. Finally, it is worth recalling that open
clusters can only provide a lower limit to the age of the Galactic Disk, while
other indicators - like White Dwarfs - are perhaps more suited to this task.

therefore provide a valuable resource for understanding the cosmic evolution of

of 54 radio sources fairly reliable redshifts have been obtained for 44

sources of which 46 have fairly reliable redshifts. We discuss possible biases
in the observed redshift distribution, and some interesting individual objects.
Using the 8C-NEC and 7C-III samples in conjunction, we form the first sample
selected on low-frequency flux in the rest-frame of the source, rather than the
usual selection on flux density in the observed frame. This allows us to remove
the bias associated with an increasing rest-frame selection frequency with
redshift. We investigate the difference this selection makes to correlations of
radio source properties with redshift and luminosity. We show in particular
that flux-density-based selection leads to an overestimate of the steepness of

tunneling matrix element, and decreases with the bandwidth of the
single-electron intralayer excitation spectrum. The width also increases as the
Fermi level is moved towards regions where the excitation spectrum flattens
out. We argue that our qualitative conclusions are valid also for a
two-dimensional model. This indicates that at or close to half-filling in two
dimensions, when the Fermi-surface gap for zero broadening attains its peaks at

the monopole moduli space the SU(N) gauge group is broken down to $U(1)^{N-1}$
reproducing the key feature of 't Hooft's Abelian projection. There are certain
points in the moduli space where monopole positions coincide, gauge symmetry is
enhanced and gluons emerge as massless excitations. We show that there is a
linearly rising potential between zerobranes. This indicates the presence of a
stretched flux tube between monopoles. The lowest energy state is achieved when
monopoles are sitting on top of each other and gauge symmetry is enhanced. In
this case they behave as free massive particles and can condense. In fact, we
find a constant eigenfunction of the corresponding Hamiltonian which describes
condensation of monopoles. Using the monopole quantum mechanics, we argue that
large $N$ QCD in this T-dual picture is a theory of a closed bosonic membrane
propagating in {\em five} dimensional space-time. QCD point-like monopoles can
be regarded in this approach as constituents of the membrane.

Duistermaat-Heckman integration formula.
  In addition, it is studied if one can possibly derive a generalized Selberg's
trace formula on locally homogeneous manifolds using localization techniques.
However, a definite answer is obtained only in the Lie group case (we complete
the work of R. Picken) in which it is an application of the Duistermaat-Heckman
integration formula. Also a new derivation of DeWitt's term is reported.
  Furthermore, connections between evolution operators of integrable models and
localization methods are studied. A derivative expansion localization is
presented and it is conjectured to apply also to integrable models, for example
the Toda lattice.
  Moreover, a pedagogical introduction to the localization techniques is given,
as well as a list of selected references that might be useful for a beginning

  Algebras Over an Algebraically Closed Field","11 pages, latex",,,,"math.QA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we classify triangular semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf
algebras over any algebraically closed field k. Namely, we construct, for each
positive integer N, relatively prime to the characteristic of k if it is
positive, a bijection between the set of isomorphism classes of triangular
semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf algebras of dimension N over k, and the set of
isomorphism classes of quadruples (G,H,V,u), where G is a group of order N, H
is a subgroup of G, V is an irreducible projective representation of H over k
of dimension |H|^{1/2}, and u\in G is a central element of order \le 2.
  This classification implies, in particular, that any triangular semisimple
and cosemisimple Hopf algebra over k can be obtained from a group algebra by a
twist. We also answer positively the question from our previous paper whether
the group underlying a minimal triangular semisimple Hopf algebra is solvable.
We conclude by showing that any triangular semisimple and cosemisimple Hopf
algebra over k of dimension bigger than 1 contains a non-trivial grouplike
element.
  The classification uses Deligne's theorem on Tannakian categories and the
results of a paper of Movshev in an essential way. The proof of solvability and
existence of grouplike elements relies on a theorem of Howlett and Isaacs that
any group of central type is solvable, which is proved using the classification
of finite simple groups. The classification in positive characteristic relies
also on the lifting functor from our previous paper.

Fedosov star products on a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ by means of which
we are able to compute Deligne's characteristic class of these star products.
We show that this class is given by $1/\nu[\omega]+1/\nu[\Omega]$ where $\Omega
= \sum_{i=1}^\infty \nu^i \Omega_i$ is a formal series of closed two-forms on
$M$ the cohomology class of which coincides with the one introduced by Fedosov
to classify his star products. Moreover, our result implies that the
normalisation condition used by Fedosov does not have any effect on the
isomorphy class of the resulting star product. Finally we consider star
products that have additional algebraic structures and compute the effect of
these structures on the corresponding characteristic classes of these star
products. Specifying the constituents of Fedosov's construction we obtain star
products with these special properties. Finally we investigate equivalence
transformations between such special star products and prove existence of
equivalence transformations being compatible with the considered algebraic
structures.

of the older measurements. An analysis of the world's 12C(e,e'p) data has
yielded precise values of the spectroscopic factor for 1p-shell and 1s-shell

the 12C nucleus for 1p-shell and 1s-shell protons separately on the basis of
recent high-energy 12C(e,e'p) data taken at a four-momentum transfer squared of
1.1 GeV/c^2. As the resulting average value of the nuclear transparency,
0.81(0.04), is considerably higher than the value obtained from previous
analyses and theoretical estimates, the high Q^2 data were used instead for an
independent determination of the spectroscopic strength for 1p + 1s knockout.
Combining these results with the low Q^2 data the spectroscopic factors appear
to be momentum-transfer dependent. Possible explanations of these surprising
results in terms of reaction-mechanism effects or a possible breakdown of the
quasi-particle concept at high Q^2 are discussed as well.
