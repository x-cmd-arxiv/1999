the VLBA over a period of two years and measured relative positions with an
accuracy approaching 0.1 mas. The apparent proper motion of Sgr A* relative to
J1745-283 is 5.90 +/- 0.4 mas/yr, almost entirely in the plane of the Galaxy.
The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic Center can account for
this motion, and any residual proper motion of Sgr A*, with respect to
extragalactic sources, is less than about 20 km/s. Assuming that Sgr A* is at
rest at the center of the Galaxy, we estimate that the circular rotation speed
in the Galaxy at the position of the Sun is 219 +/- 20 km/s, scaled by Ro/8.0
kpc.
  Current observations are consistent with Sgr A* containing all of the nearly
2.6 x 10^6 solar masses, deduced from stellar proper motions, in the form of a
massive black hole. While the low luminosity of Sgr A*, for example, might
possibly have come from a contact binary containing of order 10 solar masses,
the lack of substantial motion rules out a ""stellar"" origin for Sgr A*. The
very slow speed of Sgr A* yields a lower limit to the mass of Sgr A* of about
1,000 solar masses. Even for this mass, Sgr A* appears to be radiating at less
than 0.1 percent of its Eddington limit.

short-duration X-ray transients. In this paper we discuss their possible
relationship to peculiar stars. Only one of the fast (few hours) X-ray
transients (GRS 1100-771) might be tentatively ascribed to a superflare arising
from a young stellar object in the Chamaeleon I star-forming cloud. At the
distance of 150 pc, Lx = 1.35 x 10E34 erg/s (8-15 keV), or 2.6 x 10E34 erg/s
(0.1-2.4 keV) assuming a thermal spectrum with kT = 10 keV, a temperature
higher than those previously seen in T Tauri stars (Tsuboi et al. 1998). The
peak X-ray luminosity is at least 2 times higher than that derived for the
protostar IRS 43 (Grosso et al. 1997) which would make -to our knowledge- the
strongest flare ever seen in a young stellar object. However, the possibility
of GRS 1100-771 being an isolated neutron star unrelated to the cloud cannot be
excluded, given the relatively large error box provided by WATCH. Regarding the
longer duration (about 1 day) X-ray transients, none of them seem to be related
to known objects. We suggest that the latter are likely to have originated from
compact objects in low-mass or high-mass X-ray binaries, similarly to XTE
J0421+560.

between lrho and the residuals to the Fundamental Plane, R_f. Our sample of
galaxies covers the range of densities, between field galaxies and poor

galaxie s containing a younger stellar sub-population while the majority of
galaxies, in any environment, are equally old. The galaxies which are likely to
contain a young stellar sub-population (negative R_a and R_f) are
preferentially found in the less dense environment.
  This segregation of the stellar population may reflect the morphology-density
relation or may result from a higher rate of recent star formation activity in
sparse environments. Using the rotational support to assess the presence of a
disk and to parameterize the morphology, we subtracted the contribution of the
morphological segregation to population segregation. It is not yet possible to
rule out that the morphology-density relation is at the origin of the

for the first time, enables one to build Schwarzschild models with known
distribution functions (DFs). The new extension makes it possible to combine a
DF that depends only on classical integrals with orbits that respect
non-classical integrals. With such a combination, Schwarzschild's orbits are
used only to represent the difference between the true galaxy DF and an
approximating classical DF. The new method is used to construct a dynamical
model of the inner Galaxy. The model is based on an orbit library that contains
22168 regular orbits. The model aims to reproduce the three-dimensional mass
density of Binney, Gerhard & Spergel (1997), which was obtained through
deprojection of the COBE surface photometry, and to reproduce the observed
kinematics in three windows - namely Baade's Window and two off-axis fields.
The model fits essentially all the available data within the innermost 3 kpc.
The axis ratio and the morphology of the projected density contours of the COBE
bar are recovered to good accuracy within corotation. The kinematic quantities
- the line-of-sight streaming velocity and velocity dispersion, as well as the
proper motions when available - are recovered, not merely for the fitted
fields, but also for three new fields. The dynamical model deviates most from
the input density close to the Galactic plane just outside corotation, where
the deprojection of the surface photometry is suspect. The dynamical model does
not reproduce the kinematics at the most distant window, where disk
contamination may be severe.

arbitrary potential. Two specific ``improved'' potentials (suppressing leading
scaling corrections) are selected by Monte Carlo computation. Critical
exponents are extracted from high-temperature series specialized to improved
potentials, achieving high accuracy; our best estimates are:
$\gamma=1.2371(4)$, $\nu=0.63002(23)$, $\alpha=0.1099(7)$, $\eta=0.0364(4)$,
$\beta=0.32648(18)$. By the same technique, the coefficients of the small-field
expansion for the effective potential (Helmholtz free energy) are computed.
These results are applied to the construction of parametric representations of
the critical equation of state. A systematic approximation scheme, based on a
global stationarity condition, is introduced (the lowest-order approximation
reproduces the linear parametric model). This scheme is used for an accurate
determination of universal ratios of amplitudes. A comparison with other
theoretical and experimental determinations of universal quantities is
presented.

this effect is related to the concomitant changes in the energy landscape. The

analysed to extract interfunnel rate constants for the Lennard-Jones cluster.

presented by the present author, this paper proposes a novel philosophy of
nonlinear computation and analysis. The nonlinear problems are considered an
ill-posed linear system. In this way, all nonlinear algebraic terms are instead
expressed as Linearly independent variables. Therefore, a n-dimension nonlinear
system can be expanded as a linear system of n(n+1)/2 dimension space. This
introduces the possibility to applying generalized inverse of matrix to
computation of nonlinear systems. Also, singular value decomposition (SVD) can
be directly employed in nonlinear analysis by using such a methodology.

Asymptotically Locally Euclidean (QALE) metrics. These satisfy a complicated
asymptotic condition, implying that g is asymptotic to the Euclidean metric on
C^m/G away from its singular set. When C^m/G has an isolated singularity, QALE
metrics are just ALE metrics.
  Our main interest is in Ricci-flat QALE Kahler metrics on X. We prove an
existence result for Ricci-flat QALE Kahler metrics: if G is a subgroup of
SU(m) and X a crepant resolution of C^m/G, then there is a unique Ricci-flat
QALE Kahler metric on X in each Kahler class. This is proved using a version of
the Calabi conjecture for QALE manifolds. We also determine the holonomy group
of the metrics in terms of G.

iterated AAFT (IAAFT), which is more consistent in representing the null

inferences of nonlinearity after marginal rejection of the null hypothesis were
premature and have to be re-investigated taken into account the inaccuracies in
the AAFT algorithm, mainly concerning the mismatching of the linear
correlations. In order to deal with such inaccuracies we propose the use of
linear together with nonlinear polynomials as discriminating statistics. The
application of this setup to some well-known real data sets cautions against
