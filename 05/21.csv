distinguish the cosmological signal from foreground contamination. We present a
comprehensive treatment of this problem and study how foregrounds degrade the
accuracy with which the Boomerang, MAP and Planck experiments can measure
cosmological parameters. Our foreground model includes not only the
normalization, frequency dependence and scale dependence for each physical
component, but also variations in frequency dependence across the sky. When
estimating how accurately cosmological parameter can be measured, we include
the important complication that foreground model parameters (we use about 500)
must be simultaneously measured from the data as well. Our results are quite
encouraging: despite all these complications, precision measurements of most
cosmological parameters are degraded by less than a factor of 2 for our main
foreground model and by less than a factor of 5 in our most pessimistic
scenario. Parameters measured though large-angle polarization signals suffer
more degradation: up to 5 in the main model and 25 in the pessimistic case. The
foregrounds that are potentially most damaging and therefore most in need of
further study are vibrating dust emission and point sources, especially those
in the radio frequencies. It is well-known that E and B polarization contain
valuable information about reionization and gravity waves, respectively.
However, the cross-correlation between polarized and unpolarized foregrounds
also deserves further study, as we find that it carries the bulk of the
polarization information about most other cosmological parameters.

used to test the validity of three independent sets of stellar evolutionary
tracks. A statistical method is described and applied to the colour-magnitude
diagram of the six selected components, giving rise to $\chi^2$-contours in the
metallicity--age plane. The effects of the Hipparcos parallaxes on these
confidence regions are studied in detail for these binaries through a
comparison with very accurate but older orbital parallaxes. There are no
significant differences in 51 Tau and $\theta^2$ Tau, and hence the test
validates the sets of theoretical tracks used. However the orbital parallax of
V818 Tau leads to metallicities too large in comparison with the observed
range, while the Hipparcos parallax give consistent results, at the 1$\sigma$
level. Comparisons between the predicted and measured masses are also made and
show a good agreement. However, even if the Padova tracks predict correct

correlation with the peak temperatures or the cooling timescales during
outbursts. Among the combinations of white dwarf and envelope masses which give
the same peak temperature, the explosion is more violent for a lower white
dwarf mass owing to its smaller gravitational potential. Comparison of the
nucleosynthesis results with observations implies that at least two-third of
the white dwarf masses for the observed ONeMg novae are $\simeq 1.1 M_\odot$,
which are significantly lower than estimated by previous hydrodynamic studies
but consistent with the observations of V1974 Cyg. Moreover, the envelope
masses derived from the comparison are $\gtrsim 10^{-4} M_\odot$, which are in
good agreement with the ejecta masses estimated from observations but
significantly higher than in previous hydrodynamic studies. With such a low
mass white dwarf and a high mass envelope, the nova can produce interesting
amounts of $\gamma$-ray emitters $^7$Be, $^{22}$Na, and $^{26}$Al. We suggest
that V1974 Cyg has produced $^{22}$Na as high as the upper limit derived from

body. Significant amounts of dark matter may play an equally important role:
the dark matter gravitational potential tends to concentrate baryons towards
the center, thus enhancing both the star formation rate and metal production.
Also, the dynamical properties of the ISM, and the occurrence of a blowout or
blowaway are shown to be determined by the dark matter content. We present
detailed analytical/numerical models describing the evolution of dwarf
Irregular galaxies including the above and other effects. The main results are:
(i) dwarfs with total masses $M\simlt 5\times 10^6 M_\odot$ are blown away;
those with gas masses up to $\simeq 10^9 M_\odot$ lose mass in an outflow; (ii)
metallicities are found to correlate tightly with dark matter content and are
consistent with a range of dark-to-visible mass ratios $\phi\approx 0-30$ with
about 65% of the dwarfs in the sample having $\phi\approx 0-10$; (iii) we
predict a lower limit to the oxygen abundance in dIs of $12+log(O/H)\approx
7.2$; (iv) outflows are not particularly important for the metallicity
evolution of dwarf galaxies and certainly less than star formation for gas
consumption; however, dwarfs with gas masses few $\times 10^8 M_\odot$ are
shown to be the major pollutants of the IGM; (v) the ISM HI velocity dispersion
correlates with metallicity and, indepentently of dark matter, scales as

the sake of comparison, we also simulate a CDM model with spectral index n=0.8
(TCDM), also COBE normalized. We argue that, in our non--hydro simulations,
where CDM particles describe both actual CDM and baryons, the galaxy
distribution traces CDM particles. Therefore, we use them to define clusters
and their velocities to work out cluster masses. As CDM particles are more
clustered than HDM and therefore have, in average, greater velocities, this
leads to significant differences from PS predictions.
  Such predictions agree with simulations if both HDM and CDM are used to
define clusters.
  Clusters defined through CDM in MDM models, instead, are less numerous than
PS estimates, by a factor ~0.3, at the low mass end; the factor becomes
\~0.6-0.8, depending on the mix, on intermediate mass scales (~4-5, h^-1 10^14

expected to overproduce clusters over intermediate scales are viable; (ii) the
greater reduction factor at small scales agrees with the observational data
dependence on the cluster mass M (which, however, may be partially due to
sample incompleteness); (iii) the higher spectral normalization is felt at
large scales, where MDM models produce more objects (hence, large clusters)
than CDM. MDM1 even exceeds Donahue et al. (1998) findings, while MDM2 is
consistent with them. (abridged)

approximately over a factor of 10^4 - from 1 min up to more than 1 month. We
find that the distributions for $\Delta t \leq$ 4 days (1560 mins) are
consistent with a power-law asymptotic behavior, characterized by an exponent
$\alpha \approx 3$, well outside the stable L\'evy regime $0 < \alpha < 2$. To
test the robustness of the S&P result, we perform a parallel analysis on two
other financial market indices. Database (iv) contains 3560 daily records of
the NIKKEI index for the 14-year period 1984-97, and database (v) contains 4649
daily records of the Hang-Seng index for the 18-year period 1980-97. We find
estimates of $\alpha$ consistent with those describing the distribution of S&P
500 daily-returns. One possible reason for the scaling of these distributions
is the long persistence of the autocorrelation function of the volatility. For
time scales longer than $(\Delta t)_{\times} \approx 4$ days, our results are
consistent with slow convergence to Gaussian behavior.

the kinetics of the early stages of homopolymer collapse following a quench
from temperatures above to below the theta temperature. In the first stage,
nascent droplets of the dense phase are formed, with little effect on the
configurations of the bridges that join them. The droplets then grow by
accreting monomers from the bridges, thus causing the bridges to stretch.
During these two stages the overall dimensions of the chain decrease only
weakly. Further growth of the droplets is accomplished by the shortening of the
bridges, which causes the shrinking of the overall dimensions of the chain. The
characteristic times of the three stages respectively scale as the zeroth, 1/5
and 6/5 power of the the degree of polymerization of the chain.

the most famous example illustrating self-similarity. It is well-known that the
Gutenberg-Richter distribution has to be modified for large seismic moments,
due to energy conservation and geometrical reasons. Several models have been
proposed, either in terms of a second power law with a larger b-value beyond a
cross-over magnitude, or based on a ``hard'' magnitude cut-off or a ``soft''
magnitude cut-off using an exponential taper. Since the large scale tectonic
deformation is dominated by the very largest earthquakes and since their impact
on loss of life and properties is huge, it is of great importance to constrain
as much as possible the shape of their distribution. We present a simple and
powerful probabilistic theoretical approach that shows that the Gamma
distribution is the best model, under the two hypothesis that the
Gutenberg-Richter power law distribution holds in absence of any condition
(condition of criticality) and that one or several constraints are imposed,
either based on conservation laws or on the nature of the observations
themselves. The selection of the Gamma distribution does not depend on the
specific nature of the constraint. We illustrate the approach with two
constraints, the existence of a finite moment release rate and the observation
of the size of a maximum earthquake in a finite catalog. Our predicted ``soft''
maximum magnitudes compare favorably with those obtained by Kagan [1997] for
the Flinn-Engdahl regionalization of subduction zones, collision zones and
mid-ocean ridges.

observations, we explore the theoretical hypothesis in which each earthquake
can produce a series of aftershock independently of its size according to its
``local'' Omori's law with exponent $p=1+\theta$. In this scenario, an
aftershock of the main shock produces itself other aftershocks which themselves
produce aftershocks, and so on. The global observable Omori's law is found to
have two distinct power law regimes, the first one with exponent $p_-=1 -
\theta$ for time $t < t^* \sim \kappa^{-1/\theta}$, where $0<1-\kappa <1$
measures the fraction of triggered earthquakes per triggering earthquake, and
the second one with exponent $p_+=1 + \theta$ for larger times. The existence
of these two regimes rationalizes the observation of Kisslinger and Jones
[1991] that the Omori's exponent $p$ seems positively correlated to the surface
heat flow: a higher heat flow is a signature of a higher crustal temperature,
which leads to larger strain relaxation by creep, corresponding to fewer events
triggered per earthquake, i.e. to a larger $\kappa$, and thus to a smaller
$t^*$, leading to an effective measured exponent more heavily weighted toward
$p_+>1$.

  127-162, Springer Verlag, 1999",,,"cs.NE cs.LG",,"  Several researchers have experimentally shown that substantial improvements
can be obtained in difficult pattern recognition problems by combining or
integrating the outputs of multiple classifiers. This chapter provides an
analytical framework to quantify the improvements in classification results due
to combining. The results apply to both linear combiners and order statistics
combiners. We first show that to a first order approximation, the error rate
obtained over and above the Bayes error rate, is directly proportional to the
variance of the actual decision boundaries around the Bayes optimum boundary.
Combining classifiers in output space reduces this variance, and hence reduces
the ""added"" error. If N unbiased classifiers are combined by simple averaging,
the added error rate can be reduced by a factor of N if the individual errors
in approximating the decision boundaries are uncorrelated. Expressions are then
derived for linear combiners which are biased or correlated, and the effect of
output correlations on ensemble performance is quantified. For order statistics
based non-linear combiners, we derive expressions that indicate how much the
median, the maximum and in general the ith order statistic can improve
classifier performance. The analysis presented here facilitates the

meta-learners has led to substantial improvements in several difficult pattern
recognition problems. In the typical setting investigated till now, each
classifier is trained on data taken or resampled from a common data set, or
(almost) randomly selected subsets thereof, and thus experiences similar
quality of training data. However, in certain situations where data is acquired
and analyzed on-line at several geographically distributed locations, the
quality of data may vary substantially, leading to large discrepancies in
performance of individual classifiers. In this article we introduce and
investigate a family of classifiers based on order statistics, for robust
handling of such cases. Based on a mathematical modeling of how the decision
boundaries are affected by order statistic combiners, we derive expressions for
the reductions in error expected when such combiners are used. We show
analytically that the selection of the median, the maximum and in general, the
$i^{th}$ order statistic improves classification performance. Furthermore, we
introduce the trim and spread combiners, both based on linear combinations of
the ordered classifier outputs, and show that they are quite beneficial in
presence of outliers or uneven classifier performance. Experimental results on
several public domain data sets corroborate these findings.

  Decomposition","63 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.LG",,"  This paper presents the MAXQ approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning
based on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy
of smaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an
additive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The paper
defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational
power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions.
The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves
that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known
as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of
state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q
through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that
MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much
faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the
value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and
execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the
policy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the
effectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the
paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the
design tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning.

hierarchical RL. In this paper, we define five conditions under which state
abstraction can be combined with the MAXQ value function decomposition. We

show experimentally that state abstraction is important for the successful
application of MAXQ-Q learning.

interact via a hard-core repulsion and an induced, long-range -1/r^3

not the `empty' state with no phions, but is a state with a non-zero density of
phions Bose-Einstein condensed in the zero-momentum mode. The condensate
corresponds to the spontaneous-symmetry-breaking vacuum with <Phi> neq 0 and
its excitations (""phonons"" in atomic-physics language) correspond to Higgs
particles. The phase transition happens when the phion's physical mass m is
still positive; it does not wait until m^2 passes through zero and becomes
negative. However, at and near the phase transition, m is much, much less than
the Higgs mass M_h. This interesting physics coexists with `triviality;' all
scattering amplitudes vanish in the continuum limit, but the vacuum condensate
becomes infinitely dense. The ratio m/M_h, which goes to zero in the continuum
limit, can be viewed as a measure of non-locality in the regularized theory. An
intricate hierarchy of length scales naturally arises. We speculate about the
possible implications of these ideas for gravity and inflation.

  17-25, 1999",,,,"hep-ph astro-ph cond-mat hep-ex hep-th physics.hist-ph",,"  Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) is often discussed using models of the
$TH\epsilon \mu $ type which involve, basically, energy independent parameters.
However, if LSV is generated at the Planck scale or at some other fundamental
length scale, it can naturally preserve Lorentz symmetry as a low-energy limit
(deformed Lorentz symmetry, DLS). Deformed relativistic kinematics (DRK) would
be consistent with special relativity in the limit $k$ (wave vector) $\to ~0$
and allow for a deformed version of general relativity and gravitation. We
present an updated discussion of the possible implications of this pattern for
cosmic-ray physics at very high energy. A $\approx ~10^{-6}$ LSV at Planck
scale, leading to a DLS pattern, would potentially be enough to produce very
important observable effects on the properties of cosmic rays at the $\approx
\~10^{20} eV$ scale (absence of GZK cutoff, stability of unstable particles,
lower interaction rates, kinematical failure of the parton model...). We
compare our approach with more recent similar claims made by S. Coleman and S.
Glashow from models of the $TH\epsilon \mu$ type.

that in the supersymmetric case they can even contain subsingular vectors.
After choosing a suitable ordering for the N=1 Ramond algebra generators we
compute the ordering kernel, which turns out to be two-dimensional for complete
Verma modules and one-dimensional for G-closed Verma modules. These
two-dimensional ordering kernels allow us to derive multiplication rules for
singular vector operators and lead to expressions for degenerate singular
vectors. Using these multiplication rules we study descendant singular vectors
and derive the Ramond embedding diagrams for the rational models. We give all
explicit examples for singular vectors, degenerate singular vectors, and
subsingular vectors until level 3. We conjecture the ordering kernel

[-1,1]. Let E(A), where A is a subset of [-1,1], be a family of spectral
projectors for Delta and m(A)=(E(A)e, e) be the corresponding spectral measure.
Here e is the characteristic function of the unit element of the group H. We
estimate the value m([-1,-1+t] \cup [1-t,1]) when t tends to 0. More precisely
we prove the inequality m([-1,-1+t] \cup [1-t,1]) > const t^{2+alpha} for any
positive alpha.

  In a previous paper this problem was solved in the case of the unit interval
for many weights M. Here we investigate the extent to which the methods used
previously apply to general compact plane sets, and introduce some new methods.
In particular, we obtain many results for the case of the closed unit disc.

the case of a fixed final endpoint. Using this observation, we give an
elementary proof of the Morse Index Theorem for Riemannian geodesics with two
variable endpoints, in the spirit of the original Morse's proof. This approach
reduces substantially the effort required in the proofs of the Theorem given in
previous articles on the subject. Exactly the same argument works also in the
case of timelike geodesics between two submanifolds of a Lorentzian manifold.
For the extension to the lightlike Lorentzian case, just minor changes are
required and one obtains easily a proof of the focal index theorems of Beem,
Ehrlich and Kim.

interactions of composite, high-spin hadrons is proposed. Because there are no
known wave equations without significant problems, we propose to construct the
phenomenology without explicit reference to a wave equation. This is done by
constructing the individual pieces of a perturbation theory and then utilizing
the perturbation theory as the definition of the phenomenology. The covariant
spinors for a particle of spin $j$ are constructed directly from Lorentz
invariance and the basic precepts of quantum mechanics following the logic put
forth originally by Wigner and developed by Weinberg. Explicit expressions for
the spinors are derived for j=1, 3/2 and 2. Field operators are constructed
from the spinors and the free-particle propagator is derived from the vacuum
expectation value of the time-order product of the field operators. A few
simple examples of model interactions are given. This provides all the
necessary ingredients to treat at a phenomenological level and in a covariant
manner particles of arbitrary spin.

incomplete. The complete system of dynamic equations arises after appending Lin
constraints which describe motion of fluid particles in a given velocity field.
The complete system of dynamic equations for the ideal fluid can be integrated.
Description in terms of hydrodynamic potentials (DTHP) arises as a result of
this integration. The integrated system contains indefinite functions of three
arguments, which can be expressed via initial and boundary conditions. The
remaining initial and boundary conditions for the integrated system can be made
universal (i.e. the same for all fluid flows), and the resulting system of
equations contains full information about the fluid flow including initial and
boundary conditions for the fluid flow. Some hydrodynamic potentials appear to
be frozen into the fluid, and the Kelvin's theorem on the velocity circulation
can be formulated in a contour-free form. Description in terms of the wave
function (DTWF) appears to be a kind of DTHP. Calculation of slightly
rotational flows can be carried out on the basis of DTHP, or DTWF. Such a
description of a rotational flow appears to be effective.

  British Journal for Philosophy of Science",,,,"quant-ph",,"  Peter Lewis ([1997]) has recently argued that the wavefunction collapse
theory of GRW (Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber [1986]) can only solve the problem
of wavefunction tails at the expense of predicting that arithmetic does not
apply to ordinary macroscopic objects. More specifically, Lewis argues that the
GRW theory must violate the enumeration principle: that `if marble 1 is in the
box and marble 2 is in the box and so on through marble $n$, then all $n$
marbles are in the box' ([1997], p. 321). Ghirardi and Bassi ([1999]) have
replied that it is meaningless to say that the enumeration principle is
violated because the wavefunction Lewis uses to exhibit the violation cannot
persist, according to the GRW theory, for more than a split second ([1999], p.
709). On the contrary, we argue that Lewis's argument survives Ghirardi and
Bassi's criticism unscathed. We then go on to show that, while the enumeration
principle can fail in the GRW theory, the theory itself guarantees that the
principle can never be empirically falsified, leaving the applicability of
arithmetical reasoning to both micro- and macroscopic objects intact.

essential that the distribution function $P(x)$ of the results of a position
measurement is identical with $|\Psi|^2$ of the wavefunction $\Psi$ of the
single system under consideration. It is shown that this feature is not an
additional assumption, but can be derived strictly from the chaotic motion of a
