regions of regular clusters using ROSAT PSPC data. Outside the cooling flow
region, the beta-model describes the observed surface brightness closely, but
not precisely. Between 0.3 and 1 virial radii, the profiles are characterized
by a power law with slope, expressed in terms of the beta parameter, in the
range beta=0.65 to 0.85. The values of beta in this range of radii are
typically larger by ~0.05 than those derived from the global fit. There is a
mild trend for the slope to increase with temperature, from <beta>~0.68 for 3
keV clusters to ~0.8 for 10 keV clusters; however, even at high temperatures
there are clusters with flat gas profiles, 0.7. Our values of beta at large
radius are systematically higher, and the trend of beta with temperature is
weaker than was previously found; the most likely explanation is that earlier
studies were affected by an incomplete exclusion of the central cooling flow
regions. For our regular clusters, the gas distribution at large radii is quite
close to spherically symmetric and this is shown not to be an artifact of the
sample selection. The gas density profiles are very similar when compared in
the units of cluster virial radius. The radius of fixed mean gas overdensity
1000 (corresponding to the dark matter overdensity 200 for Omega=0.2) shows a
tight correlation with temperature, R~T**0.5, as expected from the virial
theorem for clusters with the universal gas fraction. At a given temperature,
the rms scatter of the gas overdensity radius is only ~7% which translates into
a 20% scatter of the gas mass fraction, including statistical scatter due to
measurement uncertainties.

collapse supernovae with 1<lt> z <lt> 2, but about one third will have z > 2.
Rates at z > 5 are highly uncertain. For ground based 8-10 m class telescopes
we predict ~ 0.1 supernova per square arcmin to I_AB = 27, with about twice as
many core collapse SNe as Type Ia's. The typical redshift will be z ~ 1, with
an extended tail up to z ~ 2. Detectability of high redshift supernovae from

of the highest X-ray and radio luminosities L_x ~ 1.1 x 10^{44} erg/s, L_{1.37

to be for diffuse clumps in the northeast tail/plume about 20'' (~20 kpc in

strong emission from the [O III] doublet with Seyfert 2-like line ratios, which

spectroscopic data with state-of-the-art non-LTE photospheric models
demonstrates that the observed opacity to EUV radiation probably results from a
more complex structure than a simple H+He, chemically layered atmosphere.
Instead, EUV photometry and phase resolved EUV spectroscopy indicate a likely
spatial non-uniformity in the surface distribution of helium, which is
consistent with a model in which material is accreted from the wind of the dM
secondary. The rotational modulation of the spatially inhomogeneous EUV opacity
allows us to estimate the rotation period of the white dwarf (0.463 +/- 0.004
days). We have also reviewed two plausible origins proposed by Burleigh et al.

introduce a new parallel switching method that allows faster gate operation by
switching all external parameters simultaneously. These two methods are applied

of short-distance structures, if described by linear operators: they can be
continuous, discrete or ""unsharp"" in one of two ways. In the literature,
various quantum gravity models of space-time at short distances point towards
one of these two types of unsharpness. Here, we investigate the properties of
fields over such unsharp coordinates. We find that these fields are continuous
- but possess only a finite density of degrees of freedom, similar to fields on
lattices. We observe that this type of unsharpness is technically the same as
the aperture induced unsharpness of optical images. It is also of the same type
as the unsharpness of the time-resolution of bandlimited electronic signals.
Indeed, as a special case we recover the Shannon sampling theorem of
information theory.

  Island, Korea",,,"UPR-848T","hep-th",,"  In the first lecture, we derive the five-dimensional effective action of
strongly coupled heterotic string theory for the complete (1,1) sector of the
theory by performing a reduction, on a Calabi-Yau three-fold, of M-theory on
S1/Z2. The supersymmetric ground state of the theory is a multi-charged BPS
three-brane domain wall, which we construct in general. In this first lecture,
we assume the ``standard'' embedding of the spin connection into the E8 gauge
connection on one orbifiold fixed plane. In the second lecture, we generalize
these results to ``non-standard'' embeddings. That is, we allow for general E8
X E8 gauge bundles and for the presence of five-branes. Properties of these
``non-perturbative''vacua, as well as of the resulting low-energy theories, are
discussed. In the last lecture, we review the spectral cover formalism for
constructing both U(n) and SU(n) holomorphic vector bundles on elliptically
fibered Calabi-Yau three-folds which admit a section. Restricting the structure
group to SU(n), we derive, in detail, a set of rules for the construction of
three-family particle physics theories with phenomenologically relevant gauge
groups. We illustrate these ideas by constructing several explicit three-family
non-perturbative vacua.

analytical solution of the BPS equation for the near-horizon and asymptotically

equation must be considered separately and, in general, the embeddings of the

the gravitational field with an eigenspinor of the Dirac operator via the

generalizing the notion of Killing spinors. The solutions of this spinorial
field equation are called weak Killing spinors (WK-spinors). They are special
solutions of the Einstein-Dirac equation and in dimension n=3 the two equations
essentially coincide. It turns out that any Sasakian manifold with Ricci tensor
related in some special way to the metric tensor as well as to the contact
structure admits a WK-spinor. This result is a consequence of the investigation
of special spinorial field equations on Sasakian manifolds (Sasakian
quasi-Killing spinors). Altogether, in odd dimensions a contact geometry
generates a solution of the Einstein-Dirac equation. Moreover, we prove the
existence of solutions of the Einstein-Dirac equations that are not WK-spinors
in all dimensions n > 8.

focal points (counted with multiplicity) along a semi-Riemannian geodesic
$\gamma$. For a Riemannian or a non spacelike Lorentzian geodesic, such number
is equal to the intersection number (Maslov index) of a continuous curve with a
subvariety of codimension one of the Lagrangian Grassmannian of a symplectic
space. Such intersection number is proven to be stable in a large variety of
circumstances. In the general semi-Riemannian case, under suitable hypotheses
this number is equal to an algebraic count of the multiplicities of the
conjugate points, and it is related to the spectral properties of a non
self-adjoint differential operator. This last relation gives a weak extension
of the classical Morse Index Theorem in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry. In
this paper we reprove some results that were incorrectly stated by Helfer in a
previous reference; in particular, a counterexample to one of Helfer's results,
which is essential for the theory, is given. In the last part of the paper we
discuss a general technique for the construction of examples and
counterexamples in the index theory for semi-Riemannian metrics, in which some
new phenomena appear.

significant when the classical phase space area escaping through the cantorus
