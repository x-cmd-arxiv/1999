from the clusters Abell 1795 and Abell 2199, which represents the large scale
presence of a new and very soft emission component, is an illusion in the EUVE
Deep Survey (DS) detector image. Specifically BBK found that the radial profile
of photon background surface brightness, for concentric annuli centered at a
detector position which has been used to observe cluster targets, shows an
intrinsic `hump' of excess at small radii which resembles the detection of
extended cluster EUV. We accordingly profiled background data, but found no
evidence of significant central excess. However, to avoid argument concerning
possible variability in the background pattern, we performed a clincher test
which demonstrates that a cluster's EUV profile is invariant with respect to
photon background. The test involves re-observation of A2199 and A1795 when the
photon background was respectively three and two times higher than before, and
using a different part of the detector. The radial profiles of both clusters,
which have entirely different shapes, were accurately reproduced. In this way
the BBK scenario is quantitatively excluded, with the inevitable conclusion
that the detected signals are genuinely celestial.

abundances and physical conditions in the diffuse interstellar clouds seen
along the line of sight to the star 23 Ori. Strong low-velocity (SLV)
absorption, due to cool, moderately dense neutral gas and representing about
92% of the total N(H I), is seen for various neutral and singly ionized species
at +20 km/s < v < +26 km/s. Weaker low-velocity absorption, probably largely
due to warmer neutral gas, is seen primarily for various singly ionized species
at 0 km/s < v < +30 km/s. Absorption from a number of singly and doubly ionized
species, perhaps due to a radiative shock, is seen at -108 km/s < v < -83 km/s.
Weak absorption components from ionized gas are seen at intermediate velocities
(-43 km/s < v < -4 km/s). The large range in n_e (from 0.04 cm^{-3} to 0.95
cm^{-3}) derived independently from nine pairs of neutral and singly ionized
species in the SLV gas suggests that additional processes besides simple
photoionization and radiative recombination affect the ionization balance. The
adopted average SLV electron density, n_e = 0.15+/-0.05 cm^{-3}, implies a
relatively large n_e/n_H ~ 0.01, and thus some ionization of hydrogen in these
predominantly neutral components. Comparisons of the SLV depletions and n_H
with those found for the strong ``component B'' (v ~ -14 km/s) blend toward
zeta Oph hint at a possible relationship between depletion and local density
for relatively cold interstellar clouds. Calcium appears to be more severely
depleted in warm, low density gas than has generally been assumed. An appendix
summarizes the most reliable oscillator strengths currently available for a

giant stars to solar mass stars located on the red giant branch. The model
assumes that the planet is dissipated at the bottom of the convective envelope
of the giant star. The giant's evolution is then followed in detail. We analyze
the effects of different accretion rates and different initial conditions. The
computations indicate that the accretion process is accompanied by a
substantial expansion of the star, and in the case of high accretion rates, hot
bottom burning can be activated. The possible observational signatures that
accompany the engulfing of a planet are also extensively investigated. They
include : the ejection of a shell and a subsequent phase of IR emission, an
increase in the 7Li surface abundance and a potential stellar metallicity
enrichment, spin-up of the star due to the deposition of orbital angular
momentum, the possible generation of magnetic fields and a related X-ray
activity due to the development of shear at the base of the convective
envelope, and the effects on the morphology of the horizontal branch in
globular clusters. We propose that the IR excess and high Li abundance observed
in 4-8% of the G and K giants originate from the accretion of a giant planet, a
brown dwarf or a very low-mass star.

prediction of strong-field general relativity. The signature of the marginally
stable orbit is a saturation in QPO frequency, assumed to track inner disk
radius, versus mass accretion rate. Previous studies of 4U1820-30 have used
x-ray count rate as an indicator of mass accretion rate. However, x-ray count
rate is known to not correlate robustly with mass accretion rate or QPO
frequency in other sources. Here, we examine the QPO frequency dependence on
two other indicators of mass accretion rate: energy flux and x-ray spectral
shape. Using either of these indicators, we find that the QPO frequency
saturates at high mass accretion rates. We interpret this as strong evidence

nuclei (AGNs). It involves photoionization calculations of a large number of
clouds, in several pre-determined geometries, and a comparison of the
calculated line intensities with observed emission line light curves. Fitting
several observed light curves simultaneously provides strong constraints on
model parameters such as the run of density and column density across the
nucleus, the shape of the ionizing continuum, and the radial distribution of
the emission line clouds. When applying the model to the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC
5548, we were able to reconstruct the light curves of four ultraviolet
emission-lines, in time and in absolute flux. This has not been achieved by any
previous work. We argue that the Balmer lines light curves, and possibly also
the MgII2798 light curve, cannot be tested in this scheme because of the
limitations of present-day photoionization codes. Our fit procedure can be used
to rule out models where the particle density scales as r^{-2}, where r is the
distance from the central source. The best models are those where the density
scales as r^{-1} or r^{-1.5}. We can place a lower limit on the column density
at a distance of 1 ld, of N_{col}(r=1) >~ 10^{23} cm^{-2} and limit the
particle density to be in the range of 10^{12.5}>N(r=1)>10^{11} cm^{-3}. We
have also tested the idea that the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the
ionizing continuum is changing with continuum luminosity. None of the
variable-shape SED tried resulted in real improvement over a constant SED case
although models with harder continuum during phases of higher luminosity seem
to fit better the observed spectrum. Reddening and/or different composition
seem to play a minor role, at least to the extent tested in this work.

conclude that on kinematic grounds, two M dwarfs have space motions that

a CM diagram derived from accurate photometry and Hipparcos parallaxes, these
two possible proper-motion companions to beta Pic are very young; we derive an

Mazzitelli. In fact, the proposed beta Pic companions comprise two of the three
youngest M dwarfs in the sample of 160 dM stars for which we have data. The
chromospheric and coronal activity of these two stars also confirm that they

with previous measurements. At higher energies, the spectrum does not require
non-thermal components and the observation of a line at 6.8 keV supports the
ASCA interpretation of the source as an accreting white dwarf. Assuming a
source distance of 188 pc, the bolometric luminosity in the 2-10 keV band is 6

sources that were unidentified in the deep HST and ground-based R-band images
used in Smail et al (1998). We place limits on colours of these sources from
deep high-resolution Keck II imaging and find they have 2-sigma limits of
(I-K)>6.8 and (I-K)>6.0 respectively. Both sources thus class as EROs. Using
the spectral properties of the submm source in the radio and submm we argue
that these EROs are probably the source of the submm emission, rather than the
bright spiral galaxies previously identified by Smail et al. (1998). From the
surface density of these submm-bright EROs we suggest that this class accounts
for the majority of the reddest members of the ERO population, in good
agreement with the preliminary conclusions of pointed submm observations of
individual EROs. We conclude that the most extreme EROs represent a population
of dusty, ultraluminous galaxies at high redshifts; further study of these will
provide insights into the nature of star formation in obscured galaxies in the
early Universe. The identification of similar counterparts in blank field submm
surveys will be extremely difficult owing to their faintness (K~20.5, I>26.5).

discovered here and suggest that both galaxies lie at z>2.

infinitely larger than the root-mean-square longitudinal turbulent fluctuations
$v_T$, the effective Taylor advection velocity $V_{ad}$ should take the latter
into account.
  (iii) When two or more probes are employed the application of the Taylor
hypothesis and the optimal choice of the effective advecting wind $V_{ad}$ need
extra care. We present practical considerations for minimizing the errors
incurred in experiments using one or two probes. (iv) Analysis of the Taylor

simulation for black hole formation after the scale of the density fluctuations

spherically symmetric black hole formation in the radiation-dominated,
spatially flat background universe for a realistic initial condition supplied
from the analytic solution. It is found that the initial metric perturbation
has to be non-linear (the maximum value of 3D conformal factor $\psi_0$ at
$t=0$ should be larger than $\sim 1.4$) for a black hole to be formed, but the
threshold amplitude for black hole formation and the final black hole mass
considerably depend on the initial density (or metric) profile of the
perturbation: The threshold value of $\psi_0$ at $t=0$ for formation of a black
hole is smaller for a high density peak surrounded by a low density region than
for that surrounded by the average density region of the flat universe. This
suggests that it is necessary to take into account the spatial correlation of
density fluctuations in the study of primordial black hole formation.

velocity relative to surrounding matter, and not to the observer's reference
frame. The minimal velocity (i.e., the velocity that minimizes these
quantities) relative to a single large body being a function of the distance to
and mass of the body. In consequence, the minimal velocity is a function of
position, and the reference frame associated to this velocity is strictly of
local validity. We further assume that, at any given point, light propagates
isotropically solely in the minimal-velocity local frame existing at the point.
We obtain the following results: (i) After showing the compatibility of the
gravitational field eqs. with our assumptions, we find the functional
dependance of the minimal velocity on the distance to and mass of a single
large body. (ii) A permanent gravitational field is the convective rate of
change of the minimal velocity field. (iii) A Lorentz transformation connects
the values of quantities related to a particle, for two different velocities of
the particle relative to its minimal-velocity local frame. However, a Lorentz
transformation does not connect this frame with any other moving uniformly with

the individual holes to ``boosted Schwarzschild'' form. We attempt to compute
this radiation by treating the geometry for a single boosted conformally flat

second order perturbation theory. In this we attempt to mimic a previous

find that the boosted black hole case presents additional subtleties, and
although one can evolve perturbatively and compute radiated energies, it is
much less clear than in the spinning case how useful for the study of

symmetry down to the discrete subgroup respected by the lattice theory. We
find, however, that the O(a^2) terms in the potential of the chiral Lagrangian
maintain an SO(4) subgroup of SU(4). It follows that the leading discretization
errors in the pion masses are SO(4) symmetric, implying three degeneracies
within the seven lattice irreducible representations. These predictions hold
also for perturbatively improved versions of the action. These degeneracies are
observed, to a surprising degree of accuracy, in existing data. We argue that
the SO(4) symmetry does not extend to the masses and interactions of other
hadrons (vector mesons, baryons, etc), nor to higher order in a^2. We show how
it is possible that, for physical quark masses of O(a^2), the new SO(4)
symmetry can be spontaneously broken, leading to a staggered analogue of the
Aoki-phase of Wilson fermions. This does not, however, appear to happen for
presently studied versions of the staggered action.

superconformal anomaly in supergravity. This scenario is naturally realized if
supersymmetry is broken in a hidden sector whose couplings to the observable
sector are suppressed by more than powers of the Planck scale, as occurs if
supersymmetry is broken in a parallel universe living in extra dimensions. This
scenario is extremely predictive: soft supersymmetry breaking couplings are
completely determined by anomalous dimensions in the effective theory at the
weak scale. Gaugino and scalar masses are naturally of the same order, and
flavor-changing neutral currents are automatically suppressed. The most glaring
problem with this scenario is that slepton masses are negative in the minimal
supersymmetric standard model. We point out that this problem can be simply
solved by coupling extra Higgs doublets to the leptons. Lepton flavor-changing
neutral currents can be naturally avoided by approximate symmetries. We also
describe more speculative solutions involving compositeness near the weak
scale. We then turn to electroweak symmetry breaking. Adding an explicit \mu
term gives a value for B\mu that is too large by a factor of order 100. We
construct a realistic model in which the \mu term arises from the vacuum
expectation value of a singlet field, so all weak-scale masses are directly
related to m_{3/2}. We show that fully realistic electroweak symmetry breaking

theory as an example of how the method works, we discuss the formulation of the
Quantum Action Principle (QAP) in the ERG and show that the Slavnov-Taylor
identities can be directly derived for the cutoff effective action at any
momentum scale. Firstly the QAP is exploited to analyse the breaking of
dilatation invariance occurring in the scalar theory in this approach. Then we
address SU(N) Yang-Mills theory and extensively treat the key issue of the
boundary conditions of the flow equation which, in this case, have also to
ensure restoration of symmetry for the physical theory. In case of a chiral
gauge theory, we show how the chiral anomaly can be obtained in the ERG.
