submillimeter (submm)-wave surveys, because their positional accuracy is only
several arcseconds. Currently, centimeter-wave VLA observations are required in
order to determine sub-arcsec positions, and so to make reliable optical
identifications. Carilli & Yun (1999) pointed out that the ratio of the radio
and submm-wave flux densities provides a redshift indicator for dusty
star-forming galaxies, when compared with the tight correlation observed
between the far-infrared and radio flux densities for low-redshift galaxies.
This method provides a useful, albeit imprecise, indication of the distance to
a submm-selected galaxy. However, because the degeneracy between the effects of
increasing the redshift of a galaxy and decreasing its dust temperature is not
broken, it does not provide an unequivocal redshift estimate.

redshift galaxy groups found by Boyle, Fong & Shanks (1988), on the assumption
that it is caused by gravitational lensing of a flat QSO number count, rather
than any other systematic effect (e.g dust). An isothermal sphere lens model,
requires a velocity dispersion of 1286+72-91 km/s. Addition of a constant
density plane reduces this to 1143+109-153 km/s, while the plane density is
0.081+-0.032h g/cm**2. Both these values are considerably larger than the
400-600km/s expected for poor clusters and groups and imply that the mass
associated with such groups is ~4 times larger than inferred from virial
analyses. If due to lensing, this measurement clearly tends to favour high
values of Omega_0. We demonstrate how an estimate of Omega_0 may be obtained,
finding Omega_0=1.3(n/3x10^-4h^3Mpc^-3)(r/1Mpc)(sigma/1286km/s)^2. Systematic
uncertainties in r, the extent of the anti-correlation, and n, the group space
density, currently dominate this determination, but this will be a route to
estimating Omega_0 in improved galaxy-QSO datasets where systematics can be
better controlled. We compared our result to that of Williams & Irwin (1998)
who find a positive correlation between bright LBQS QSOs and APM galaxies.
Adapting the analysis of Williams & Irwin to our use of galaxy groups, we find
agreement between the amplitude of the positive cross-correlation found for
bright QSOs and the negative cross-correlation found for faint QSOs. This
analysis leads to a common estimate of Omega_0*sigma_8~3-4. This, however, is
significantly higher than indicated from several other analyses. Further tests
of the accuracy of galaxy-QSO cross-correlations and their implications for
Omega_0 and sigma_8 will soon be available from the new 2dF QSO catalogue.

expressed in terms of an effective entropy: Gaussian initial conditions are a
maximum entropy realisation of the initial power spectrum, gravitational

the specific case of the Coma and Virgo clusters, for which upper limits on the
gamma ray emission exist, that equipartition implies gamma ray fluxes that are
close or even in excess of the EGRET limit, depending on the adopted model of
CR injection. We use this bound to limit the validity of the equipartition

  LaTeX2e with aaspp4 (AAS-TeX v4.0). Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We propose a new, two-stage algorithm for inverting strong gravitational
lenses. The key to the algorithm is decoupling the effects of lens
magnification and intrinsic structure in the background source in the
appearance of lensed arcs. First, the distribution of mass on the deflector
plane and the geometry of the source-deflector-observer optical system are
established. This is done by numerically simulating the lensing of light past a
parametric mass model, and adjusting the handful of model parameters to match
the positions and shapes of the observed and simulated lensed arcs. At the same
time, this determines the magnification of the background source induced by the
lensing process. The predicted magnification is then removed from the data to
reveal the intrinsic, though still distorted, background distribution of light.
After tracing each lensed ray back to the source plane, the data are combined
to produce a surface brightness distribution of the source. This two-stage
inversion scheme produces a parametric model of the deflector and a pixelized
rendering of the background source which together mimic the observed
gravitationally lensed features. We test the viability of scheme itself on a
well-studied collection of lensed objects in the galaxy-cluster MS 2137.
Confident in the algorithm, we apply it second time to predict the distribution
of mass in the galaxy-cluster MS 1455 responsible for an observed triplet of
lensed arcs. Our predictions about the lens in MS 1455 make it particularly
interesting, for a single background source is responsible for both tangential
arcs and a radial arc.

$Y$ resulting from this asymmetry, taking into account both the time evolution
of the $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ distribution function and the spectral
distortions in these. We calculate this change in two schemes: (1) a lepton
asymmetry directly generated by $\nu_e$ mixing with a lighter right-handed
sterile neutrino $\nu_s$; and (2) a lepton asymmetry generated by a
$\nu_\tau\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ or $\nu_\mu\leftrightarrow\nu_s$ transformation
which is subsequently partially converted to an asymmetry in the
$\nu_e\bar\nu_e$ sector by a matter-enhanced active-active neutrino
transformation. In the first scheme, we find that the percentage change in $Y$
is between -1% and 9% (with the sign depending on the sign of the asymmetry),
bounded by the Majorana mass limit $m_{\nu_e}\la 1$ eV. In the second scheme,
the maximal percentage reduction in $Y$ is 2%, if the lepton number asymmetry
in neutrinos is positive; Otherwise, the percentage increase in $Y$ is $\la 5%$
for $m^2_{\nu_\mu,\nu_\tau}-m^2_{\nu_s}\la 10^4$ eV. We conclude that the

respect to iron do not show scatters on a [alpha/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, but this
does not imply that interstellar matter in the halo was homogeneous because a
chemical evolution path on this diagram is degenerate in the star formation
rate. On the other hand, apparent spread of [Sr/Fe] ratio among metal-poor halo
stars does not reflect an inhomogeneous metal enrichment, instead it is due to
a sharp increase in a production rate of strontium that is probably synthesised
in slightly less massive stars than progenitor of iron-producing SNII.

reflection and warm plasma scattering of the nuclear radiation. When this
continuum is extrapolated downwards to 0.1 keV, further components arise. The
NGC1068 spectrum is rich in emission lines, mainly due to K-alpha transitions
of He-like elements from oxygen to iron, plus a K-alpha fluorescent line from
neutral iron. If the ionized lines originate in the warm scatterer, its thermal
and ionization structure must be complex. From the continuum and line
properties, we estimate a column density, of the warm scatterer less than a few
10^21 atoms/cm/cm. In the Circinus Galaxy, the absence of highly ionized iron
is consistent with a scattering medium with ionization parameter U<5 and
density about a few times 10^22 atoms/cm/cm. In both cases the neutral iron
line is most naturally explained as fluorescence in the medium responsible for
the Compton reflection continuum. In NGC1068 an optically thin plasma emission
with kT~500 eV and strongly sub-solar metallicity is required, while such a
component is only marginal in the Circinus Galaxy. We tentatively identify this

relative to nuclear disks in non-active spirals. We find no strong evidence for
rapid in-fall or out-flow of neutral hydrogen, but our limits on the mass
infall rates are compatible with that required to feed a Seyfert nucleus.
  Among the galaxies surveyed here, neutral hydrogen absorption traces
parsec-scale gas only in NGC 4151. Based on the kinematics of the absorption
line, the disk symmetry axis appears to align with the radio jet axis rather
than the outer galaxy axis. The most surprising result is that we detect no 21
cm absorption towards the central radio sources of the hidden Seyfert 1 nuclei
Mrk 3, Mrk 348, and NGC 1068. Moreover, 21 cm absorption is commonly observed
towards extended radio jet structure but appears to avoid central, compact
radio sources in Seyfert nuclei. To explain these results, we propose that 21
cm absorption towards the nucleus is suppressed by either free-free absorption,
excitation effects (i.e., enhanced spin temperature), or rapid motion in the
obscuring gas. Ironically, the implications of these effects is that the
obscuring disks must be small, typically not larger than a few tens of parsecs.

the total flux and number counts of submillimeter sources, it can affect the
number counts and fluxes of flux-limited samples. Therefore imposing a flux cut
on point sources not only reduces the overall Poisson noise, but imprints the
correlations between lensing clusters on the unresolved flux distribution.
Using a simple model, we quantify the lensing anisotropy induced in
flux-limited samples and compare this to Poisson noise. We find that while the
level of induced anisotropies on the scale of the cluster angular correlation
length is comparable to Poisson noise for a slowly evolving cluster model, it
is negligible for more realistic models of cluster evolution. Thus the removal
of point sources is not expected to induce measurable structure in the

discussed, including production cross sections, NLSP decay widths, branching
ratios and distributions, for dominant and rare channels. We sketch how to

measured via, e.g. threshold-scanning techniques. Several experimental methods
to measure the NLSP mass and lifetime are proposed and simulated in detail. We

they are relevant for any general low-energy SUSY breaking scenario. Values of

be studied in great detail with a LC operating at \sqrt s>m_h+m_Z. In the TESLA
scenario, with 500 fb^-1 accumulated at \sqrt s = 350 GeV, about 10^5 hZ events
could be produced through the Higgstrahlung process. At a future LC with a \sim
1 cm beam-pipe radius and a thin Si detector there will be excellent separation
between the various flavours. With the high statistics available it will thus
become possible to measure the various branching ratios with a few % error.
Typically one expects 8 % precision on BR(h\to\bar cc), 6 % on BR(h\to gg) and
\sim 1 % on \sigma(hZ) x BR(h\to\bar bb) access to BR(h\to WW^*) and, as
explained in section 3, this measurement can give access to the Higgs total
decay width and therefore to all partial widths. In particular one can
precisely measure \Gamma(h\to\bar bb) and \Gamma(h\to\tau^+\tau^-) which have a
high sensitivity to MSSM effects\cite{gunion} and therefore allow an essential
test of the Higgs sector. If m_A < 1 TeV, it becomes possible to measure a
significant deviation and, within MSSM, to give an indirect estimate of m_A
thus extending the effective sensitivity above the discovery domain of LHC. In
the following section we describe a detailed analysis on the measurement of

implies an identification of Grassmann coordinate fields of lower dimensional

With this identification the covariant current distribution forms with support
on the superbrane worldvolumes become invariant under the target space
supersymmetry and can be used to write the coupled superbrane action as an
integral over the D-dimensional manifolds ((D-1)-brane worldvolume). We compare
the equations derived from this new ('Goldstone fermion embedded') action with
the ones produced by a more straightforward generalization of the free brane
actions based on the incorporation of the boundary terms with Lagrange
multipliers ('superspace embedded' action). We find that both procedures
produce the same equations of motion and thus justify each other. Both actions
