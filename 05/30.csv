cosmology might be today without it. The Einstein-de Sitter model would not
have been so keenly defended, and there might have been more interest in
negative space curvature, but the observations would have driven us to about
where we are. We would have had much the same ideas about structure formation,
but they would have been considered incomplete because the initial conditions
would have to be invoked ad hoc. And there would not have been the exciting
sense in the community that we might be approaching the end game. Whether or
not it is true it certainly has been an important factor in the present high
level of activity in cosmology.

studied at the atomic scale. The basic drift mechanisms are identified using a
complete set of energy barriers for adatom hopping on the Cu(001) surface,
combined with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. The energy barriers are
calculated by the embedded atom method, and parameterized using a simple model.
The dependence of the flow on the temperature, the size of the clusters, and
the strength of the applied field is obtained. For both islands and voids it is
found that edge diffusion is the dominant mass-transport mechanism. The rate
limiting steps are identified. For both islands and voids they involve
detachment of atoms from corners into the adjacent edge. The energy barriers
for these moves are found to be in good agreement with the activation energy
for island/void drift obtained from Arrhenius analysis of the simulation
results. The relevance of the results to other FCC(001) metal surfaces and

how the boundary theory, initially at zero temperature self thermalizes and
acquires a finite temperature. Yang-Mills theory is known to be chaotic
(classically) and the imaginary part of the gluon self-energy (damping rate of
the gluon plasma) is expected to give the Lyapunov exponent. We explain how the
imaginary part would arise in the corresponding supergravity calculation due to
absorption at the horizon of the black hole.

presumption of the space-time continuum, and bases physical theory on a small
number of rational and empirical principles. After briefly describing the
philosophical principles underlying the theory, we rigorously construct a
discrete model of quantum mechanics. Kets are names, or labels which categorise
states of matter but do not directly describe them. The principle of
superposition is seen as a definitional truism in the categorisation of states.
This resolves the measurement problem of quantum mechanics by attributing the
collapse of the wave function to information. The probability interpretation
has a natural meaning in which the configuration of interacting particles plays
the role of a hidden variable. The model supports a form of relativistic
quantum field theory which does not depend on quantisation or second
quantisation from classical mechanics. Continuous laws of wave mechanics are
found in a discrete metaphysic which does not involve waves. Classical law is
the expected behaviour of many elementary particles. The constraints on the
theory are sufficient to establish that particles are point-like entities with
specific properties found in nature. Newton's first law and conservation of
momentum are established from the principle of homogeneity. Maxwell's equations
are derived from the simple interaction in which a Dirac particle emits or
absorbs a photon. Feynman rules are calculated for the discrete theory and
differ from the standard rules by the removal of the ultraviolet divergence and
the use of proper loop integrals. They give finite and unambiguous results.
