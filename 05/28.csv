emission and (2) provides additional disk heating on top of the direct stellar
radiation. Detailed radiative transfer calculations based on the simplest model
for envelope-embedded disks successfully fit the data from UV to mm wavelengths
and show that the disks have central holes. This model also resolves naturally
some puzzling results of IR imaging.

continuum, H2 fluorescence, and CIV 155 nm emission. In our first flight, we
mapped one quarter of the sky with 5-10 arcminute imaging resolution. In this
paper, we model the dominant contribution of the background, dust-scattered

independent measurements in 6.25 by 6.25 sq. degree bins. Stars and
instrumental stellar halos are removed from the data. We present a map of the
continuum background obtained in the 174 nm telescope. We use a model that
follows Witt, Friedman, and Sasseen (1997: WFS) to account for the
inhomogeneous radiation field and multiple scattering effects in clouds. We
find that the dust in the diffuse interstellar medium displays a moderate
albedo (a=0.55+/-0.1) and highly forward scattering phase function parameter
(g=0.75+/-0.1) over a large fraction of the sky, similar to dust in star
forming regions. We also have discovered a significant variance from the model.

models differ from those in general relativity only slightly, we find that MAP

theory that is competitive to solar-system tests. For example, if all other
parameters except for the CMB normalization are fixed, a value of the
Brans-Dicke parameter omega as large as 500 could be identified with MAP, and
for Planck, values as large as omega \simeq3000 could be identified; these
sensitivities are decreased roughly by a factor of 3 if we marginalize over the
baryon density, Hubble constant, spectral index, and reionization optical
depth. In more general scalar-tensor theories, omega may evolve with time, and
in this case, the CMB probe would be complementary to that from solar-system

  Abundance ratios for Sc, Ti, V, Ni, & Eu are typical of halo field and
cluster stars. However, Si, Al, Ba, & La are overabundant with respect to what
is seen in other globular clusters of similar metallicity. Superimposed on the
primordial abundance distribution is evidence for the existence of
proton-capture synthesis. We recover some of the C, N, O, Na, Mg, & Al
abundance swings and correlations found in other more metal-poor globular
clusters but the range of variation is muted. The Al enhancements appear to be
from the destruction of 25,26Mg, not 24Mg. The C+N+O abundance sum is constant
to within the observational errors, and agrees with the C+N+O total that might
be expected for M4 stars at birth.

capture nucleosynthesis than is found in the less-evolved stars of the RGB.

a hot quasi-spherical region plus a cold outer disk for this source. We thus
concentrate on geometrically thin Shakura-Sunyaev type disks (Shakura & Sunyaev
1973; hereafter SS73). We have devised a modified viscosity law that has a
quasi-stable upper branch. Via numerical simulations, we show that the model
does account for several gross observational features of GRS 1915+105. On the
other hand, the rise/fall time scales are not short enough, and no rapid
oscillations on time scales $\simlt$ 10 s emerge naturally from the model.
  We then consider and numerically test a more elaborate model that includes
the cold disk, a corona, and plasma ejections from the inner disk region and
show that this model allows us to reproduce several additional observed
features of GRS 1915+105. We conclude that the most likely structure of the
accretion flow in this source is that of a cold disk with a modified viscosity
prescription, plus a corona that accounts for much of the X-ray emission, and
unsteady plasma ejections that occur when the luminosity of the source is high.

  R. Cornett, (San Francisco: ASP)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The rest-frame UV contains the most sensitive indicators of age for
elliptical galaxies. While the near-UV flux from young ellipticals isolates the
main sequence turnoff, the far-UV flux in old ellipticals is dominated by hot
horizontal branch (HB) stars. This evolved population was first revealed by
early UV observations showing a sharp flux increase shortward of rest-frame
2500 A, subsequently dubbed the ""UV upturn."" The phenomenon has since been
characterized in many local ellipticals, and measurements at intermediate
redshifts are now underway. Once ellipticals reach ages of 5-10 Gyr, stellar
and galactic evolution theories predict that the UV-to-optical flux ratio can
increase by orders of magnitude over timescales of a few Gyr, making the UV
upturn the most rapidly evolving feature of these galaxies. It is thus expected
to fade dramatically with increasing redshift.
  I review the imaging and spectroscopic evidence for the nature of the UV
upturn in nearby ellipticals, and then present observations that measure the UV
upturn at an epoch significantly earlier than our own. Far-UV data from the HUT
demonstrate that the spectra of nearby ellipticals are dominated by hot HB
stars. FOC UV imaging of M32 and the M31 bulge detected the UV-bright phases of
post-HB stars, but did not reach the HB itself. Recent STIS observations were
the first to image the hot HB and post-HB stars in the center of the nearest
elliptical galaxy, M32; these observations also show a striking lack of
UV-bright post-AGB stars. FOC observations of Abell 370, a rich galaxy cluster
at z=0.375, show that giant ellipticals at a lookback time of 4 Gyr can exhibit
strong UV luminosity, with no evidence of evolution in the UV upturn between
this epoch and our own, thus implying a high redshift of formation (z_f > 4).

  Functional Derivatives of the Integer-State Energy Density Functionals","7 pages, 17 references",,,"LA-UR-99-1824","cond-mat.mtrl-sci",,"  Open-system density functional theory may be formulated in terms of ensemble
averages arising from interaction with a bath. The system is allowed to
exchange particles with the bath and the states in the ensemble average are
those corresponding to integer numbers of particles. The weights in the
ensemble average are typically equated with time-averaged values of the
occupation numbers of the various states comprising the open system. As a
result, there are two constraints on the occupation numbers: (1) Their sum must
be unity so that the ensemble average is a probability function and (2) The sum
of the occupation numbers times the number of particles for the associated
state must equal the time-averaged number of particles.
  By solving explicitly the first constraint we arrive at an expression for the
energy having a form structurally equivalent to a Gibbs thermodynamic function.
  From this form follows both chemical potential equalization and the
identification of the functional derivative of the energy for a particular
state with respect to its integer-state density as the chemical potential. We
highlight a distinction between functional derivatives of the time-averaged and
the integer-state energies with respect to integer-state densities. From this
we can restate the jump discontinuity behavior of the exchange-correlation
functional in terms of integer-state behavior.

Hubbard model with two inequivalent sites, whose on-site energies differ by an
offset Delta. The study is carried out both in D=1 and D=2 (square and
honeycomb lattices), using exact Lanczos diagonalization, finite-size scaling,
and Berry's phase calculations of the polarization. The Born effective charge
jump from positive infinity to negative infinity previously discovered in D=1
by Resta and Sorella is confirmed to be directly connected with the transition
from the band insulator to the Mott insulating state, in agreement with recent
work of Ortiz et al.. In addition, symmetry is analysed, and the transition is
found to be associated with a reversal of inversion symmetry in the ground
state, of magnetic origin. We also study the D=1 excitation spectrum by Lanczos
diagonalization and finite-size scaling. Not only the spin gap closes at the
transition, consistent with the magnetic nature of the Mott state, but also the
charge gap closes, so that the intermediate state between the two insulators
appears to be metallic. This finding, rationalized within unrestricted
Hartree-Fock as due to a sign change of the effective on-site energy offset
Delta for the minority spin electrons, underlines the profound difference
between the two insulators. The band-to-Mott insulator transition is also
studied and found in the same model in D=2. There too we find an associated,
although weaker, polarization anomaly, with some differences between square and
honeycomb lattices. The honeycomb lattice, which does not possess an inversion
symmetry, is used to demonstrate the possibility of an inverted piezoelectric
effect in this kind of ionic Mott insulator.

HERA to leptoquarks, and to squarks of R-parity violating supersymmetry, is
confronted to existing indirect constraints from rare and forbidden
semi-leptonic decays, atomic parity violation and neutrinoless double-beta
decay, as well as to direct constraints from LEP and Tevatron colliders. The
HERA and Tevatron colliders are found to offer exciting prospects for new

that the next-order coefficient is anomalously small: $h_{thr}=(2/ \pi) \gamma
+ 0.002 \gamma^3$. Our approach is based on a singular perturbation expansion
of the soliton near the turning point; it allows to evaluate $h_{thr}(\gamma)$
to all orders in $\gamma$ and can be easily reformulated for other perturbed
soliton equations.

turbulent soap film is presented. A two probe laser Doppler velocimeter enables
a non-intrusive simultaneous measurement of the velocity at spatially separated
points. The breakdown of Taylor's hypothesis is quantified using the cross
correlation between two points displaced in both space and time; correlation is
better than 90% for scales less than the integral scale. A quantitative study
of the decorrelation beyond the integral scale is presented, including an
analysis of the failure of Taylor's hypothesis using techniques from
predictability studies of turbulent flows. Our results are compared with
similar studies of 3D turbulence.

there are infinitely many sets of directions giving the maximum level of

triorthogonal states |Psi> = c_1 |z_1>|z_2>|z_3> + c_2 |-z_1>|-z_2>|-z_3>. It

epitaxial heterostructures to design a transistor that can sense and control a
single donor electron spin. Spin resonance transistors may form the
technological basis for quantum information processing. One and two qubit
operations are performed by applying a gate bias. The bias electric field pulls
the electron wave function away from the dopant ion into layers of different
alloy composition. Owing to the variation of the g-factor (Si:g=1.995,
Ge:g=1.563), this displacement changes the spin Zeeman energy, allowing
single-qubit operations. By displacing the electron even further, the overlap
with neighboring qubits is affected, which allows two-qubit operations. Certain
Silicon-Germanium alloys allow a qubit spacing as large as 200 nm, which is
well within the capabilities of current lithographic techniques. We discuss
manufacturing limitations and issues regarding scaling up to a large size
computer.

We find that under three photon resonant conditions, in some region of the
parameter space of the rabi frequencies $\Omega_1,\Omega_2,\Omega_3$, emission
is dominantly by the level 4 at the line center even though there is an almost
equal distribution of populations in all the levels. As one increases
$\Omega_3$ with $\Omega_1 and \Omega_2$ held fixed, the four level system
'dynamically collapses' to a two level system. The steady state populations and
the the resonance flourescence from all the levels provide adequate evidence to
this effect.
