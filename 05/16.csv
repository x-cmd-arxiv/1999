Uses mn.sty and mncite.sty. Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02764.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Single-armed, stationary density waves can propagate in very weakly
self-gravitating gas disks dominated by a central mass. Examples include
circumstellar disks of protostars and molecular disks in galactic nuclei. We
explore the linear and nonlinear dynamics of such waves. Variational methods
yield nonlinear versions of the dispersion relation, angular momentum flux, and
propagation velocity in the tight-winding limit. The pitch angle increases with
amplitude until the tight-winding approximation breaks down. We also find a
series of nonlinear logarithmic spirals which is exact in the limit of small
disk mass and which extends to large pitch angle.

  of a highly-active R Coronae Borealis star","AJ in press (June), 7 figures, 4 tables",,"10.1086/300897",,"astro-ph",,"  We examine long-term low-dispersion IUE, SWP and LWP spectroscopy of the R
Coronae Borealis (RCB) star V854 Cen, obtained across the deep 1991, 1992-1993
and 1994 declines. We also report the optical light curve for the star in the
interval 1987-1998, including multi-color photometry obtained during 1989-1998.
  Analysis of the UV emission line spectra indicates most lines decay during
the deep declines on characteristic timescales comparable to that reported for
optical features. Fe, Mg and neutral C lines decay on timescales of typically
50-100 d. Other lines, notably ionized C lines, decay on longer timescales (>
200 d) or appear to be unaffected by the declines. The general nature of the UV
emission lines and other UV features during the declines is consistent with the
E1/E2/BL line-region model developed from the behavior of optical spectral
features during declines. However, the detailed line-behavior indicates large
intrinsic variability between decline events inconsistent with the simple
E1/E2/BL model. Limited temporal coverage prevents detailed examination of the
geometry of the emission line region or the obscuring dust. We also report the
first detection of the transition-region line C IV 1550 in the spectrum of an
RCB star.

are found to exhibit a zigzag shape which remains under tension, becoming
linear just before breaking. At room temperature they are found to spin, what
explains the extremely long apparent interatomic distances shown by electron
microscopy.The zigzag structure is stable if the tension is relieved, the wire
holding its chainlike shape even as a free-standing cluster. This unexpected
metallic-wire stiffness stems from the transverse quantization in the wire, as
shown in a simple free electron model.

Lagrangian. The model is constrained by the known symmetries of QCD in the m_Q
-> infinity limit for the heavy quarks, and chiral symmetry in the light quark
sector. Using a limited number of free parameters it is possible to compute
several phenomenological quantities, e.g. the leptonic B and B** decay
constants; the Isgur-Wise form factors: xi, tau(3/2), tau (1/2), describing the
semi-leptonic decays B -> D(*) l nu, B -> D** l nu; the form factors for heavy
to light decays B -> rho l nu, B -> a_1 l nu. I show that the semileptonic
heavy-to-light form factors calculated in the model fulfill the general
relations that hold in QCD in the large energy limit for the final hadron.

nature of pulsars, including whether they are composed of $\beta$-stable
nuclear matter or strange quark matter. Observations of the newly discovered
millisecond X-ray pulsar \sax with the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer place firm
constraint on the radius of the compact star. Comparing the mass - radius
relation of \sax with the theoretical mass - radius relation for neutron stars
and for strange stars, we find that a strange star model is more consistent
with SAX J1808.4-3658, and suggest that it is a likely strange star candidate.

  Lyapunov exponent","10 pages",,,,"math-ph math.MP math.SP",,"  In this paper we introduce a method that allows one to prove uniform local
results for one-dimensional discrete Schr\""odinger operators with Sturmian
potentials. We apply this method to the transfer matrices in order to study the
Lyapunov exponent and the growth rate of eigenfunctions. This gives uniform
vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent on the spectrum for all irrational rotation
numbers. For irrational rotation numbers with bounded continued fraction
expansion, it gives uniform existence of the Lyapunov exponent on the whole
complex plane. Moreover, it yields uniform polynomial upper bounds on the
growth rate of transfer matrices for irrational rotation numbers with bounded
density. In particular, all our results apply to the Fibonacci case.
