glassy one-step replica symmetry breaking and aging, whereas for r>=p only the
replica symmetric phase exists.

created just after inflation, with number density $\sim 10^{-2}M^3$ where $M$
is the mass of the inflaton. Here, we argue that creation may be expected to
continue, maintaining about the same number density, until a usually much later
epoch. This epoch is either the `intermediate epoch' when Hubble parameter
falls below the gravitino mass, or the reheat epoch if that is earlier. We
verify that such late-time creation indeed occurs if only a single chiral
superfield is relevant, using the description of the helicity 1/2 gravitino
provided recently by Kallosh et. al. (hep-th/9907124) and Giudice et. al.
(hep-ph/9907510). Arguments are presented in favor of late-time creation in the
general case. For the usual inflation models, $M$ is rather large and
gravitinos from late-time creation are so abundant that a subsequent era of
thermal inflation is needed to dilute them.

anomalous dimensions. It is also easy to resum rainbow-free self-energy chains.
Taming the combinatoric explosion of all possible nestings and chainings of a
primitive self-energy divergence is a much more demanding problem. We solve it
in terms of the coproduct $\Delta$, antipode S, and grading operator Y of the
Hopf algebra of undecorated rooted trees. The vital operator is $S\star Y$,
with a star product effected by $\Delta$. We perform 30-loop Pad\'e-Borel
resummation of 463 020 146 037 416 130 934 BPHZ subtractions in Yukawa theory,
at spacetime dimension d=4, and in a trivalent scalar theory, at d=6,
encountering residues of $S\star Y$ that involve primes with up to 60 digits.
Even with a very large Yukawa coupling, g=30, the precision of resummation is
remarkable; a 31-loop calculation suggests that it is of order $10^{-8}$.

noncommutative QED. The theory is obtained by examining the consistent minimal
coupling to noncommutative U(1) gauge field. The *-product admits the coupling
of the matter with only three varieties of charges, i.e., 0, +1 and -1.
Ultraviolet divergence can be absorbed into the rescaling of the fields and the
parameters at least at one loop level. To examine the infrared aspect of the
theory the anomalous magnetic dipole moment is calculated. The dependence on
the direction of photon momentum reflects the Lorentz symmetry violation of the
system. The explicit calculation of the finite part of the photon vacuum
polarization shows the singularity ln({q C^TC q}) (C^{\mu\nu} is a
noncommutative parameter.) in the infrared side which also exists in
noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. It is associated with the ultraviolet
behavior of the theory. We also consider the extension to chiral gauge theory
in the present context, but the requirement of anomaly cancellation allows only
noncommutative QED.

variations associated with Poincare transformations. I find that both Lorentz
and translational invariance are anomalously violated in general, but that they
are respected when the variations of the determinant are regularized to give a
Wess-Zumino consistent anomaly (the Bardeen anomaly). If the variations are
regularized to give a covariant anomaly, then Poincare invariance is not
respected. Following Manohar in an investigation of Poincare anomalies in a
chiral gauge theory, this gives an alternative way to understand the need for a
consistent regularization of the variations of the fermionic determinant.
