implying that it is dominated by a fluid whose equation of state is negative.
Quintessence is a possible explanation. In particular, the concept of tracking
solutions permits to adress the fine-tuning and coincidence problems. We study
this proposal in the simplest case of an inverse power potential and
investigate its robustness to corrections. We show that quintessence is not
affected by the one-loop quantum corrections. In the supersymmetric case where
the quintessential potential is motivated by non-perturbative effects in gauge
theories, we consider the curvature effects and the K\""ahler corrections. We
find that the curvature effects are negligible while the K\""ahler corrections
modify the early evolution of the quintessence field. Finally we study the
supergravity corrections and show that they must be taken into account as
$Q\approx m_{\rm Pl}$ at small red-shifts. We discuss simple supergravity
models exhibiting the quintessential behaviour. In particular, we propose a
model where the scalar potential is given by $V(Q)=\frac{\Lambda^{4+\alpha
}}{Q^{\alpha}}e^{\frac{\kappa}{2}Q^2}$. We argue that the fine-tuning problem
can be overcome if $\alpha \ge 11$. This model leads to $\omega_Q\approx -0.82$
for $\Omega_{\rm m}\approx 0.3$ which is in good agreement with the presently
available data.

IRAS 14348-1447 is presented. The merger system has a molecular gas mass of
\~3x10^10 solar masses and a projected nuclear separation of 4.8 kpc (3.5""),
making it one of the most molecular gas-rich galaxies known and an ideal
candidate for studying the intermediate stages of an ultraluminous merger
event. The CO morphology shows two molecular gas components associated with the
stellar nuclei of the progenitors, consistent with the idea that the molecular
disks are gravitationally bound by the dense bulges of the progenitor galaxies
as the interaction proceeds. In contrast, less luminous infrared galaxies
observed to date with projected nuclear separations of ~<5 kpc show a dominant
CO component between the stellar nuclei. This discrepancy may be an indication
that the progenitors of mergers with lower infrared luminosity do not possess
massive bulges, and that the gas is stripped during the initial encounter of
their progenitors. A comparison of the CO and radio luminosities of the NE and
SW component show them to have comparable radio and CO flux ratios of
f(NE)/f(SW) ~0.6, possibly indicating that the amount of star-forming molecular
gas in the progenitors is correlated with the supernovae rate. The estimate of
molecular gas masses of the nuclei and the extent of the radio emission are
used to infer that the nuclei of IR 14348-1447 have gas densities comparable to
the cores of elliptical galaxies.

  In order to study the formation of MSPNe, we have performed numerical
simulations following the evolution of the stellar winds for a 1 solar mass

the stellar wind and taking into account the effects of a moving central star,
an asymmetric halo is formed as a consequence of the interaction with the ISM.

wider field of possibilities for the future of our Universe than it was usually
thought before. Definite predictions may be made for finite (though very large)
intervals of time only, as well as in other branches of science. In particular,
our Universe will continue to expand as far as the Lambda-term remains positive
and does not decay to other forms of matter, even if the Universe is closed.
Two new effects due to the presence of a constant Lambda-term are discussed:
reversal of a sign of the redshift change with time for sufficiently close
objects and inaccessibility of sufficiently distant objects in the Universe for
us. A number of more distant and speculative possibilities for the future
evolution of the Universe is listed including hitting a space-time singularity
during an expansion phase. Finally, in fantastically remote future, a part of
our Universe surrounding us can become supercurved and superdense due to
various quantum-gravitational effects. This returns us to the past, to the
origin of our Universe from a superdense state about 14 Gy ago. According to
the inflationary scenario, this state was almost maximally symmetric (de
Sitter-like). Though this scenario seems to be sufficient for the explanation
of observable properties of the present Universe, and its predictions have been
confirmed by observations, the question of the origin of the initial de Sitter
(inflationary) state itself remains open. A number of conjectures regarding the
very origin of our Universe, ranging from ""creation from nothing"" to ""creation
from anything"", are discussed.

inverse Compton emission. This is so far the best example in which both the
synchrotron and the Inverse Compton component are detected simultaneously and

decrease of the X-ray flux of about 30% below the break between the first and

beamed. The beamed GRB afterglow evolution has been discussed by several
authors in the ultra-relativistic case.
  It has been shown that the dynamics of the blast wave will be significantly
modified by the sideways expansion, and there may be a sharp break in the
afterglow light curves under certain circumstances. However, this is true only
when the fireball is still relativistic. Here we present an analytical approach
to the evolution of the beamed GRB blast wave expanding in the surrounding
medium (density $n\propto r^{-s}$) in the non-relativistic case, our purpose is
to explore whether the sideways expansion will strongly affect the blast wave
evolution as in the relativistic case. We find that the blast wave evolution is
strongly dependent on the speed of the sideways expansion. If it expands with
the sound speed, then the jet angle $\theta $ increases with time as $\theta
\propto ln t$, which means that the sideways expansion has little effect on the
afterglow light curves, the flux $F\propto t^{-\frac{3(5\alpha -1)}{5}}$ for
$s=0$ and $F\propto t^{-\frac{7\alpha +1}{3}}$ for $s=2$.It is clear that the
light curve of $s=2$ is not always steeper than that of $s=0$, as in the
relativistic case.We also show that if the expansion speed is a constant, then
the jet angle $\theta \propto t$, and the radius $r \propto t^{0}$, in this
case the sideways expansion has the most significant effect on the blast wave
evolution, the flux $F\propto t^{-(5\alpha -1)}$ independent of $s$, and we
expect that there should be a smooth and gradual break in the light curve.

not see AGNs at the center of most elliptical galaxies rather than in only (at
most) a few per cent of them? We propose here the simple idea that feedback
from accretion events heats the ambient gas retarding subsequent infall. In
this context, we present a class of 1D hydrodynamical evolutionary sequences
for the gas flows in elliptical galaxies with a massive central BH. The
resulting evolution is characterized by strong oscillations, in which very fast
and energetic bursts of the BH are followed by longer periods in which the
X-ray galaxy emission comes from the coronal gas. We also allow for departures
from spherical symmetry by examining scenarios in which the central engine is
either an ADAF or a more conventional accretion disk that is optically thick
except for a polar region. In all cases the duty cycle (fraction of the time
that the system will be seen as an AGN) is quite small and in the range 10^{-4}
- 10^{-3}. Thus, for any reasonable value of the efficiency, the presence of a
massive BH at the center of a galaxy seems to be incompatible with the presence
of a long-lived cooling flow.

preliminary analysis of these data, we find that > 65% of the candidates
studied show strong evidence of being real physical associations, over the

spectroscopic measurements, in others indirectly from the detection of
overdensities of objects with either the same color or the same photometric
redshift, or from a combination of color and spectroscopic information.
Preliminary results also suggest that the redshift derived from the
matched-filter algorithm is a reasonable measure of the cluster's redshift,
possibly overestimating it by Delta z ~0.1, at least for systems at z<0.7.
Overdensities of red objects have been detected in over 100 candidates, 38 of
which with estimated redshifts >0.6, and six candidates in the interval
0.45<z<0.81 have either been identified directly from measured redshifts or
have been confirmed by the measurement of at least one redshift for galaxies
located along a red-sequence typical of cluster early-type galaxies. Lastly,
five candidates among those already observed in the infrared have (I-Ks) colors

constrain the amplitude of variability in ensembles of low signal-to-noise
light curves. We find evidence for trends in this variability amplitude with
both redshift and luminosity. The mean variability amplitude declines sharply
with luminosity, as seen in local AGN, but with some suggestion of an upturn
for the most powerful sources. We find tentative evidence that this is caused
by redshift evolution, since the high redshift QSOs ($z>0.5$) do not show the
anti-correlation with luminosity seen in local AGN. We speculate on the

earlier work (Chubukov et al. cond-mat/9304046) that the low-temperature

\Delta and a spin-wave velocity c. Here we establish the remarkable fact that
no additional parameters are necessary for an antiferromagnet with a dilute

characterized by a integer/half-odd-integer valued spin, S, which measures the
net uncompensated Berry phase due to spin precession in its vicinity. We

antiferromagnet: the damping occurs on an energy scale \Gamma= n_{imp} (\hbar

analyze a database documenting every transaction for 1000 US stocks over the

complex variant of diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient fluctuates
drastically in time. We relate the analog of the diffusion coefficient to two
microscopic quantities: (i) the number of transactions $N_{\Delta t}$ in
$\Delta t$, which is the analog of the number of collisions and (ii) the local
variance $w^2_{\Delta t}$ of the price changes for all transactions in $\Delta
t$, which is the analog of the local mean square displacement between
collisions. We study the distributions of both $N_{\Delta t}$ and $w_{\Delta
t}$, and find that they display power-law tails. Further, we find that
$N_{\Delta t}$ displays long-range power-law correlations in time, whereas
$w_{\Delta t}$ does not. Our results are consistent with the interpretation
that the pronounced tails of the distribution of $G_{\Delta t} are due to
$w_{\Delta t}$, and that the long-range correlations previously found for $|

evidence for a 3D-2D crossover is found from temperature-dependent torque
measurements carried out in different magnetic fields at different field

occurrence of this ""crossing phenomenon'' is explained in a phenomenological

lattice, leading to the so called Bragg glass (BrG) phase. We first show that
the long-range topological order of the BrG is also destroyed by a parallel
current. Nonetheless, some degree of short-range order should remain, whose
destruction by thermal and impurity fluctuations, as well as the current, is
studied here. To this end, we employ a cage model for a single FL in the
presence of impurities and current, and study it analytically (by replica
variational methods), and numerically (using a transfer matrix technique). The
results are in good agreement, and in conjunction with a Lindemann criterion,
provide the boundary in the magnetic field--temperature plane for destruction
of short-range order. In all cases, we find that the addition of impurities or
current (singly or in combination) leads to further increase in equilibrium FL
fluctuations. Thus pinning to point impurities does not stabilize FLs in a
parallel current $j_z$, although the onset of this instability is much delayed
due to large potential barriers that diverge as $j_z^{-\mu}$.

variable. A metric tensor as well as a metric compatible connection is
generated by a coframe in a unique manner. The Lagrangian is a general linear

amplitude and background s-wave amplitude in low-energy neutron scattering from
a heavy nucleus which goes through the compound nucleus stage. The first effect
is in the difference between the forward and backward scattering cross
sections. Because of the chaotic nature of the compound states, this effect is
a random variable with zero mean. However, a statistical consideration shows
that the probability distribution of this effect does not obey the standard
central limit theorem. That is, the probability density for the effect averaged
over n resonances does not become a Gaussian distribution with the variance
decreasing as 1/sqrt(n) (``violation'' of the theorem!). We derive the
probability distribution of the effect and the limit distribution of the
average. It is found that the width of this distribution does not decrease with
the increase of n, i.e., fluctuations are not suppressed by averaging.
Furthermore, we consider the correlation between the neutron spin and the
scattering plane and find that this effect, although much smaller, shows
fluctuations which actually increase upon averaging over many measurements.
Limits of the effects due to finite resonance widths are also considered. In

in addition to surface tension forces. At fixed angular momentum, centripetal
forces become large when the radius of the jet goes to zero. We study the
possible importance of this observation for the pinching of a jet within a
slender jet model. A linear stability analysis shows the model to break down at
low viscosities. Numerical simulations indicate that angular momentum is
expelled from the pinch region so fast that it becomes asymptotically
irrelevant in the limit of the neck radius going to zero.

that if the rank of $\rho$ equals N then it is separable, and that bound
entangled states have rank larger than N. We also give a separability criterion
for a generic density operator such that the sum of its rank and the one of its
partial transpose does not exceed 3N. If it exceeds this number we show that
one can subtract product vectors until decreasing it to 3N, while keeping the
positivity of $\rho$ and its partial transpose. This automatically gives us a
sufficient criterion for separability for general density operators. We also
prove that all density operators that remain invariant after partial
transposition with respect to the first system are separable.
