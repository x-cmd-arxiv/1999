of galaxies are affected by a certain amount of non-gravitational energy input,
as indicated by the scaling properties of X-ray halos. Such a view has been
recently confirmed by the detection of an excess entropy in the center of
groups. It is not easy, however, to identify unambiguously the source and the

gravitational lensing effects in inhomogeneous universes. Their use of
realistic galaxy models has been limited to the singular, truncated isothermal
sphere with a fixed mass. In this paper, their method is generalized to allow
for matter distributions more accurately describing the actual properties of
galaxies, as derived from observations and N-body simulations. This includes
the density profile proposed by Navarro, Frenk and White, as well as a
distribution of galaxy masses. As an example of the possible applications of
the method, we consider lensing effects on supernova luminosity distributions.
  We find that results for different mass distributions of smooth dark matter
halos are very similar, making lensing effects predictable for a broad range of
halo profiles. We also note, in agreement with other investigations, that one
should be able to discriminate smooth halos from a dominant component of dark
matter in compact objects. For instance, a sample of 100 supernovae at redshift
z=1 can, with 99 % certainty, discriminate the case where all matter is in
compact objects from the case where matter is in smooth halos.

from well known present-day galaxies or directly observed for galaxies at
different look back times. This requires clear and consistently matched
selection criteria for galaxy samples. There is a net decrease of rest-frame,
UV luminosity density, at least since z = 1. It is interpreted as an important
decline of the star formation since the last ~9 Gyr. A similar trend is found
for the evolution of the IR luminosity density which accounts for heavily
extincted starbursts. Interestingly the global star formation density, after
including IR selected galaxies, is twice the value of estimates based on the UV
luminosity density, and this holds from z=0 to z=1.
  Large disks are not contributing much to the observed decrease, which is
mainly related to significant changes with the epoch in the distribution of
galaxy morphologies. A significant fraction of the global star formation occurs
in luminous galaxies which are apparently small or in interacting galaxies
detected in the deepest IR or radio surveys.

period, we obtained a high signal-to-noise snapshot of the UV spectrum from
1150-3300 A using the FOS on HST. This spectrum allows us to disentangle the UV
continuum more accurately from the broad wings of the emission lines, to
identify clean continuum windows free of contaminating emission and absorption,
and to deblend line complexes such as Lya+NV, CIV+HeII+OIII], SiIII]+CIII], and
MgII+FeII. Using the FOS spectrum as a template, we have fit and extracted line
and continuum fluxes from the IUE monitoring data. The cleaner continuum
extractions confirm the discovery of time delays between the different UV
continuum bands by Wanders et al. Our new measurements show delays increasing
with wavelength for continuum bands centered at 1485 A, 1740 A and 1825 A

many other Seyfert 1 galaxies, the UV spectrum of NGC 7469 shows intrinsic,

visible in archival ASCA X-ray spectra. The strength of the UV absorption,
however, is not compatible with a single-zone model in which the same material
absorbs both the UV and X-ray light. Similar to other Seyfert galaxies such as
NGC 3516, the UV-absorbing gas in NGC 7469 has a lower ionization parameter and
column density than the X-ray absorbing material. While the UV and X-ray
absorption does not arise in the same material, the frequent occurrence of both
associated UV absorption and X-ray warm absorbers in the same galaxies suggests
that the gas supply for each has a common origin.

appear to be associated with supernova shell remnants (SNRs) with typical ages

demonstrate that the interstellar media which surrounded the SGR and AXP

around most young radio pulsars and SNRs. We explore the implications of this
evidence on magnetar and propeller-based models for the rapid spin-down of SGRs

magnetars and the external ISM. Propeller-driven spin-down by fossil accretion
disks for SGRs and AXPs appears to be consistent with dense environments since
the environment can facilitate the formation of such a disk. This may occur in
two ways: 1) formation of a ``pushback'' disks from the innermost ejecta pushed
back by prompt reverse shocks from supernova remnant interactions with massive
progenitor wind material stalled in dense surrounding gas, or 2) acquisition of
disks by a high velocity neutron stars, which may be able to capture a
sufficient amounts of co-moving outflowing ejecta slowed by the prompt reverse

galaxies are held together by the gravitational force of unseen (dark) matter.
Today, the case is stronger and more precise: Dark, nonbaryonic matter accounts
for 30% +/- 7% of the critical mass density, with baryons (most of which are
dark) contributing only 4.5% +/- 0.5% of the critical density. The large-scale
structure that exists in the Universe indicates that the bulk of the
nonbaryonic dark matter must be cold (slowly moving particles). The
SuperKamiokande detection of neutrino oscillations shows that particle dark
matter exists, crossing an important threshold. Over the past few years a case
has developed for a dark-energy problem. This dark component contributes about
80% +/- 20% of the critical density and is characterized by very negative
pressure (p_X < -0.6 rho_X). Consistent with this picture of dark energy and
dark matter are measurements of CMB anisotropy that indicate that total
contribution of matter and energy is within 10% of the critical density.
Fundamental physics beyond the standard model is implicated in both the dark
matter and dark energy puzzles: new fundamental particles (e.g., axion or
neutralino) and new forms of relativistic energy (e.g., vacuum energy or a
light scalar field). A flood of observations will shed light on the dark side

within the fireball model framework, that radiating electrons are shock
accelerated to a power-law energy distribution, with universal index p \approx
2.2, and that the fraction of shock energy carried by electrons, \xi_e, is
universal and close to equipartition, \xi_e ~ 1/3. For universal p and \xi_e, a
single measurement of the X-ray afterglow flux on the time scale of a day
provides a robust estimate of the fireball energy per unit solid angle,
\epsilon, averaged over a conical section of the fireball of opening angle
\theta ~ 0.1.
  Applying our analysis to BeppoSAX afterglow data we find that: (i) Fireball
energies are in the range of 4\pi\epsilon=10^{51.5} to 10^{53.5} erg; (ii) The
ratio of observed $\gamma$-ray to total fireball energy per unit solid angle,
\epsilon_\gamma / \epsilon, is of order unity, satisfying
abs[log10(\epsilon_\gamma/\epsilon)]<0.5; (iii) If fireballs are jet like,
their opening angle should satisfy \theta>=0.1.
  Our results imply that if typical opening angles are \theta ~ 0.1, a value
consistent with our analysis, the total energy associated with a GRB event is
in the range of 10^{50} erg to 10^{51.5} erg.

resolution of the SPH simulations and excludes physical processes not included

remarkably similar properties, although there are some differences in the gas
cooling rates and in the number of galaxies that populate halos of different
mass. The full semi-analytic model, which has effectively no resolution limit

somewhat different (but readily understandable) results. Agreement is
particularly good for the present-day global fractions of hot gas, cold dense
(i.e. galactic) gas and uncollapsed gas, for which the SPH and stripped-down
semi-analytic calculations differ by at most 25%. In the most massive halos,
the stripped-down semi-analytic model predicts, on the whole, up to 50% less
gas in galaxies than is seen in the SPH simulations. The two techniques
apportion this cold gas somewhat differently amongst galaxies in a given halo.
This difference can be tracked down to the greater cooling rate in massive
halos in the SPH simulation compared to the semi-analytic model. (abridged)

the experimental results with the simulated ones by CORSIKA (COsmic Ray

component and low energy muons observed by AGASA can be well reproduced by
CORSIKA. The form of the lateral distribution of charged particles agrees well
with the experimental one between a few hundred metres and 2000 m from the
core, irrespective of the hadronic interaction model studied and the primary
composition (proton or iron). It does not depend on the primary energy between
10^17.5 and 10^20 eV as the experiment shows. If we evaluate the particle
density measured by scintillators of 5 cm thickness at 600 m from the core
(S_0(600), suffix 0 denotes the vertically incident shower) by taking into
account the similar conditions as in the experiment, the conversion relation
from S_0(600) to the primary energy is expressed as E [eV] = 2.15 x 10^17 x
S_0(600)^1.015, within 10% uncertainty among the models and composition used,
which suggests the present AGASA conversion factor is the lower limit. Though
the form of the muon lateral distribution fits well to the experiment within
1000 m from the core, the absolute values change with hadronic interaction
model and primary composition. The slope of the rho_mu(600) (muon density above
1 GeV at 600 m from the core) vs. S_0(600) relation in experiment is flatter
than that in simulation of any hadronic model and primary composition. Since
the experimental slope is constant from 10^15 eV to 10^19 eV, we need to study
this relation in a wide primary energy range to infer the rate of change of
chemical composition with energy. keywords: cosmic ray, extensive air shower,

analytical model of the cluster and void distribution, based on 88 nearby
groups, 854 clusters and 163 voids, with some of the clusters and all of the

  The dipole for the whole PSCz sample appears to have converged within a
distance of 200 $h^{-1}$Mpc and yields a value for $\beta = \Omega^{0.6}/b$ =
0.75 (+0.11,-0.08), consistent with earlier determinations from IRAS samples by

  The direction of the dipole is within 13$^o$ of the CMB dipole, the main
uncertainty in direction being associated with the masked area behind the

that the question of the origin of the CMB dipole is essentially resolved.

Their low luminosities arise from frictional heating in the neutron star. SGRs
and AXPs are accreting at $\dot{M} \sim 10^{15} gm/s $. The limited range of
near equilibrium periods corresponds to a limited range of mass inflow rates
$\dot{M}$. For lower rates the source of mass inflow may be depleted before the
asymptotic stage is reached, while sources with higher $\dot{M}$ or later ages
possess circumstellar material that is optically thick to electron scattering,

the system and if not taken into account has a considerable effect upon radial
velocity measurements of the mass donor star. We obtain a new radial velocity
amplitude for the mass donor star of K2 = 202 +/- 3 km/s, which compares with
the value of K2 = 135 +/- 3 km/s obtained in Stover, Robinson & Nather's
classic 1981 study of EM Cyg. The revised value of the amplitude combined with
a measurement of rotational broadening of the mass donor vsini = 140 +/- 6
km/s, leads to a new mass ratio of q = M2/M1 = 0.88 +/- 0.05. This solves a
long standing problem with EM Cyg because Stover et al.'s measurements
indicated a mass ratio q > 1, a value which should have led to dynamically
unstable mass transfer for the secondary mass deduced by Stover et al. The
revised value of the mass ratio combined with the orbital inclination i = 67

synchrotron emission from discrete supernova remnants, and diffuse synchrotron
emission from cosmic ray electrons spread over the galactic disk and halo. Each
of these components has a different spectral index so that the total radio
spectral index of a galaxy depends sensitively on their relative contribution
and on the processes shaping the diffuse synchrotron emission. In the present
paper we calculate the contribution of supernova remnants to the total
synchrotron emission and conclude that it is about 10%. This moderate
contribution has a noticeable effect on the nonthermal spectral index, lowering
it by $\simeq 0.1$ for steep spectra. We then calculate the diffuse synchrotron
emission in two simple models, a diffusion and a convection model. We find that
the spatially integrated nonthermal spectral index is in general a poor
diagnostic for the type of propagation or the importance of energy losses.
Spatially resolved radio data for the halo of galaxies are necessary in order
to draw firm conclusions. The steepening of the spectrum away from the disk is
a clear indication that synchrotron and inverse Compton losses are taking place
during the propagation of cosmic ray electrons in the halo. In those galaxies
for which spatially resolved data for the halos exist such a steepening has
been found. We conclude therefore that energy losses are generally important
and that cosmic ray electrons cannot freely escape from galaxies.

norm. Indeed, we demonstrate that the Levy's stability index of a vector rather
correspond to a linear application than to a scalar, and we show that the

both in low and high temperature superconductors, which include: low frequency
noise, slow voltage oscillations, history dependent dynamic response, memory of
the direction, amplitude, duration, and frequency of the previously applied
current, suppression of a large ac vortex response by a very small dc bias, and
a strong frequency dependence. Taken together, these phenomena are incompatible
with the current understanding of bulk vortex dynamics. We propose a generic
mechanism to account for these observations in terms of the competition between
the injection of a disordered vortex phase through the surface barriers at the
sample edges, and the annealing of this metastable disorder by the transport
current. The model is confirmed by investigating the current distribution
across NbSe2 single crystals using arrays of Hall sensors. For an ac current
only narrow regions near the edges are in the pinned disordered phase resulting
in a large response. In the presence of a dc bias a wide region of the sample
is filled by the disordered phase preventing vortex motion. The resulting
spatial variation of the disorder across the sample acts as an active memory of
the previously applied current sequence.

corresponding to an equal number of Mn3+ and Mn4+. At room temperature all
three samples are paramagnetic and single phase, with crystallographic symmetry
Pnma. The samples then all become ferromagnetic (FM) at $T_C\approx 265$ K. At
$\sim 230$ K, however, a second distinct crystallographic phase (denoted A-II)
begins to form. Initially the intrinsic widths of the peaks are quite large,
but they narrow as the temperature decreases and the phase fraction increases,
indicating microscopic coexistence. The fraction of the sample that exhibits
the A-II phase increases with decreasing temperature and also increases with
increasing Ca doping, but the transition never goes to completion to the lowest
temperatures measured (5 K) and the two phases therefore coexist in this
temperature-composition regime. Phase A-II orders antiferromagnetically (AFM)
below a N\'{e}el temperature $T_N \approx 160$ K, with the CE-type magnetic
structure. Resistivity measurements show that this phase is a conductor, while
the CE phase is insulating. Application of magnetic fields up to 9 T
progressively inhibits the formation of the A-II phase, but this suppression is
path dependent, being much stronger for example if the sample is field-cooled
compared to zero-field cooling and then applying the field. The H-T phase
diagram obtained from the diffraction measurements is in good agreement with
the results of magnetization and resistivity.

model system we choose the silver mean or `octonacci' chain. The
two-dimensional labyrinth tiling, which is related to the octagonal tiling, is
derived from a product of two octonacci chains. This makes it possible to treat
rather large systems numerically. For the octonacci chain, one finds singular
continuous energy spectra and critical eigenstates which is the typical
behaviour for one-dimensional Schr""odinger operators based on substitution
sequences. The energy spectra for the labyrinth tiling can, depending on the
strength of the quasiperiodic modulation, be either band-like or fractal-like.
However, the eigenstates are multifractal. The temporal spreading of a
wavepacket is described in terms of the autocorrelation function C(t) and the
mean square displacement d(t). In all cases, we observe power laws for C(t) and
d(t) with exponents -delta and beta, respectively. For the octonacci chain,
0<delta<1, whereas for the labyrinth tiling a crossover is observed from
delta=1 to 0<delta<1 with increasing modulation strength. Corresponding to the
multifractal eigenstates, we obtain anomalous diffusion with 0<beta<1 for both
systems. Moreover, we find that the behaviour of C(t) and d(t) is independent
of the shape and the location of the initial wavepacket. We use our results to
check several relations between the diffusion exponent beta and the fractal
dimensions of energy spectra and eigenstates that were proposed in the

dynamical properties of many-body theories formulated in terms of
(unrenormalized) bare propagators (and more generally, in terms of meromorphic
functions, or convolutions over meromorphic functions) to a very high accuracy.
We demonstrate the method by applying it to a T-matrix theory of the attractive
Hubbard model in two dimensions. We expand the pair propagator using a partial
fraction decomposition, and then solve for the residues and pole locations of
such a decomposition using a computer algebra system to an arbitrarily high
accuracy (we used MapleV and obtained these quantities to a relative error of
10^(-80)). Thus, this method allows us to bypass all inaccuracies associated
with the traditional analytical continuation problem. Our results for the
density of states make clear the pronounced development of a pseudogap as the
temperature is lowered in this formulation of the attractive Hubbard model.

evolution of the universe and the gravitational scalar $\phi$ is ascribed to
play the role of inflaton. The theory is characterized by the specified
coupling function $\omega(\phi)$ and the cosmological function $\lambda(\phi)$.
The function $\lambda(\phi)$ is nearly constant for $0<\phi<0.1$ and
$\lambda(1)=0$. The functions $\lambda(\phi)$ and $\omega(\phi)$ provide a
double-well potential for the motion of $\phi(t)$. Inflation commences and ends
naturally by the dynamics of the scalar field. The energy density of matter
increases steadily during inflation. When the constant $\Gamma$ in the action
is determined by the present matter density, the temperature at the end of
inflation is of the order of $10^{14} GeV$ in no need of reheating.
Furthermore, the gravitational scalar is just the cold dark matter that men
seek for.

governed by a natural extension of Newton's second law, which implies geodesic

metric in the spherical static situation. It also predicts gravitation waves
with the velocity of light. The equations of motion are recast into the ""flat
space - uniform time"" form, and compared with the geodesic equations of motion.
The principles of the post-Newtonian approximation of this theory are given,
including the way to account for preferred-frame effects. This approximation is
then developed more particularly for photons. It is found that the
preferred-frame effects do not occur in this case, nor does the difference
between Newton's second law and geodesic assumption. Thus, the post-Newtonian
predictions of this theory for photons are indistinguishable from the standard
post-Newtonian predictions of general relativity.

expansion where all orders of alpha_s\ln(1/x) are kept on an equal footing. The
anomalous dimension is very different from that obtained from the fixed

function as x ->0 which is far weaker, i.e. about x^(-0.2). The NLO corrections

with one Higgs doublet as at least three loops are required in this case. In
the models with two or more Higgs doublets the dominant source of theta is the
phases in the scalar potential, induced by CP violation in leptonic sector.
Thus, in the MSSM framework the imaginary part of the trilinear soft-breaking
parameter A_l generates the corrections to the theta angle already at one loop.
These corrections are large, excluding the possibility of large phases, unless
the universality in the slepton sector is strongly violated.

reduces the field content of the unconstrained superfield but leaves the

Low Temp.Phys. 112, 227 (1998); cond-mat/9811148, which contradicts to the
second law of thermodynamics. According to this result, the thermal
fluctuations can induce a voltage with direct component in a inhomogeneous
superconducting ring at an unaltered temperature corresponded to the resistive
transition of the ring segment with the lowest critical temperature. This
result arises from obvious statements: 1) the switching of a ring segment
$l_{b}$ into and out of the normal state, while the rest of the ring (segment
$l_{a}$) remains superconducting, can induced a voltage with dc component (It
is shown that, in spite of the wide spread opinion, this statement is correct
because the superconductivity is a macroscopic quantum phenomena); 2) the
thermal fluctuations switch the mesoscopic ring segment $l_{b}$ with lowest
critical temperature $T_{sb}$ into and out of the normal state at $T \simeq
T_{sb}$, while the rest of the ring remains superconducting if $T_{sa} > T
\simeq T_{sb}$. In order to resolve the contradiction between these obvious
statements and the second law of thermodynamics a possibility of the second
order perpetuum mobile is considered theoretically. It is shown that from two
type of the perpetuum mobile, only type ""b"" and only in quantum systems is
possible. According to the presented interpretation, the total entropy, as the
measure of the chaos, may be systematically reduced in some quantum system
because a ""switching"" between the classical and quantum mechanics is possible.

  A, Feb 2000",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.61.022720",,"physics.atom-ph",,"  The aim of this work is to identify the mechanisms responsible for very large
rates and other peculiarities observed in low-energy positron annihilation on
molecules. The two mechanisms considered are: (i) Direct annihilation of the
incoming positron with one of the molecular electrons. This mechanism dominates
for atoms and small molecules. I show that its contribution to the annihilation
rate can be related to the positron elastic scattering cross section. This
mechanism is characterized by strong energy dependence of the annihilation rate
at small positron energies if a low-lying virtual level or a weakly bound state
exists for the positron. (ii) Resonant annihilation, which takes place when the
positron undergoes resonant capture into a vibrationally excited quasibound
state of the positron-molecule complex. This mechanism dominates for larger
molecules capable of forming bound states with the positron. For this mechanism
the energy-averaged annihilation rate is proportional to the level density of
the positron-molecule complex, which is basically determined by the spectrum of
molecular vibrational states populated in the positron capture. For
room-temperature positrons this mechnism can produce annihilation rates up to 5
orders of magnitude greater than the first one. Its contribution is inversely
proportional to the positron momentum at small positron energies.
