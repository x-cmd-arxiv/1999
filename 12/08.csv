N-body simulations of a representative volume of three Cold Dark Matter
Universes. By assuming that (1) the density and peculiar velocities of baryons
trace those of the dark matter, and (2) the temperature of plasma is
proportional to the velocity dispersion of the dark matter particles in regions
where the crossing times is smaller than the supercluster free-fall time, we
investigate how thermal motions of electrons in the intra-cluster medium and
peculiar velocity of clusters can affect the secondary anisotropies in the
cosmic microwave background (CMB). We show that the thermal effect dominates
the kinematic effect and that the largest thermal decrements are associated
with the most massive clusters in superclusters. Thus, searching for the
presence of two or more close large CMB decrements represents a viable strategy
for identifying superclusters at cosmological distances. Moreover, maps of the
kinematic effect in superclusters are characterized by neighboring large peaks
of opposite signs. These peaks can be as high as ~ 10 microK at the arcminute
angular resolution. Simultaneous pointed observations of superclusters in the
millimeter and submillimeter bands with upcoming sensitive CMB experiments can
separate between the thermal and kinematic effect contributions and constrain
the evolution of the velocity field in large overdense regions.

algorithms for MHD which enables us to evolve highly stratified disks for many
orbital times. We find that MHD turbulence driven by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) produces strong amplification of weak fields within two scale
heights of the disk midplane in a few orbital times. About 25 % of the magnetic
energy generated by the MRI within two scale heights escapes due to buoyancy,
producing a strongly magnetized corona above the disk. Most of the buoyantly
rising magnetic energy is dissipated between 3 and 5 scale heights, suggesting
the corona will also be hot. The average vertical disk structure consists of a
weakly magnetized turbulent core below a strongly magnetized corona which is
stable to the MRI. The largescale field structure in both the disk and corona
is toroidal. The functional form of the stress is flat within two scale
heights, but proportional to the density above two scale heights.
  For initially weak uniform vertical fields, we find the exponential growth of
magnetic field via axisymmetric vertical modes of the MRI produces strongly
buoyant sheets of magnetic energy which break the disk apart into horizontal
channels. These channels rise several scale heights vertically before the onset
of the Parker instability distorts the sheets and allows matter to flow back
towards the midplane and reform a disk. We suggest this evolution may be
relevant to the dynamical processes which disrupt the inner regions of a disk
when it interacts with a strongly magnetized central object.

field strength and initial spin period, we demonstrate that a rapidly rotating

onto the neutron star switches off after a short time, and the star becomes an

`double-double' radio galaxy consists of a pair of double radio sources with a
common centre. Furthermore, the two lobes of the inner radio source must have a
clearly extended, edge-brightened radio morphology. Adopting this definition we
find several other candidate DDRGs in the literature. We find that in all
sources the smaller (inner) pair of radio lobes is less luminous than the
larger (outer) pair, and that the ratio of 1.4-GHz flux density of these two
pairs appears to be anti-correlated with the projected linear size of the inner
source. Also, the outer radio structures are large, exceeding 700 kpc. We
discuss possible formation scenarios of the DDRGs, and we conclude that an
interruption of the jet-forming central activity is the most likely mechanism.
For one of our sources (B 1834+620) we have been able to observationally
constrain the length of time of the interruption to a few Myr. We discuss
several scenarios for the cause of the interruption and suggest multiple
encounters between interacting galaxies as a possibility. Finally, we discuss
whether such interruptions help the formation of extremely large radio sources.

analytical model in which the peculiar radio structure of DDRGs is caused by an

restarted AGN give rise to an inner source structure within the region of the
old, outer cocoon. Standard models of the evolution of FRII sources predict gas
densities within the region of the old cocoon that are insufficient to explain
the observed properties of the inner source structure. Therefore, additional
material must have passed from the environment of the source through the bow
shock surrounding the outer source structure into the cocoon. We propose that
this material is warm clouds ($\sim\!10^4$ K) of gas embedded in the hot IGM
which are eventually dispersed over the cocoon volume by surface instabilities
induced by the passage of cocoon material. The derived lower limits for the
volume filling factors of these clouds are in good agreement with results
obtained from optical observations. The long time scales for the dispersion of
the clouds ($\sim\!10^7$ yr) are consistent with the apparently exclusive
occurrence of the DDRG phenomenon in large ($\ga 700$ kpc) radio sources and

source. Both sources apparently originate in the same host galaxy, which has a
R_s-magnitude of 19.7 and a redshift of 0.5194, as determined from the strong
emission-lines in the spectrum. We have determined the rotation measures
towards this source, as well as the radio spectral energy distribution of its
components. The radio spectrum of the large outer source is steeper than that
of the smaller inner source. The radio core has a spectrum that peaks at a
frequency of a few GHz. The rotation measures towards the four main components
are quite similar, within $\sim\!2$ rad m$^{-2}$ of 58 rad m$^{-2}$. They are
probably largely galactic in origin. We have used the presence of a bright
hotspot in the northern outer lobe to constrain the advance velocity of the
inner radio lobes to the range between 0.19c and 0.29c, depending on the
orientation of the source. This corresponds to an age of this structure in the

functions with the COBE-DMR data. Our results demonstrate that strong
constraints on compactness arise: if the universe is small compared to the
`horizon' size, correlations appear in the maps that are irreconcilable with
the observations. This conclusion is qualitatively insensitive to the matter
content of the universe, in particular, the presence of a cosmological
constant. If the universe is of comparable size to the 'horizon', the
likelihood function is very dependent upon orientation of the manifold wrt the
sky. While most orientations may be strongly ruled out, it sometimes happens
that for a specific orientation the predicted correlation patterns are
preferred over those for the conventional infinite models. The full Bayesian
analysis we use is the most complete statistical test that can be done on the
COBE maps, taking into account all possible signals and their variances in the
theoretical skies, in particular the high degree of anisotropic correlation
that can exist. We show that standard visual measures for comparing theoretical
predictions with the data such as the isotropized power spectrum $C_\ell$ are
not so useful in small compact spaces because of enhanced cosmic variance
associated with the breakdown of statistical isotropy.

singular value decomposition that allows one to propagate the covariance matrix
on the angular correlation function through to that of the spatial power
spectrum and to reconstruct smooth power spectra without underestimating the
errors. Within a parameter space of the CDM shape Gamma and the amplitude
sigma_8, we find that the angular correlations in the APM survey constrain
Gamma to be 0.19-0.37 at 68% confidence when fit to scales larger than k=0.2h

X-ray-dim superbubble DEM L 106. We use these images to examine the shell
morphology and [S II]/H-alpha ratio variations in detail.
  Of these three superbubbles, DEM L 152 has the highest X-ray surface
brightness, the most filamentary nebular morphology, the largest expansion
velocity, and the highest [S II]/H-alpha ratio. Its [S II]/H-alpha ratio
increases outwards and peaks in sharp filaments along the periphery. DEM L 192
has a moderate X-ray surface brightness, a complex but not filamentary
morphology, a moderate expansion velocity, and a low [S II]/H-alpha ratio. DEM
L 106 is not detected in X-rays. Its shell structure is amorphous and has
embedded dusty features; its expansion velocity is low.
  None of the three superbubbles show morphological features in the shell
interior that can be identified as directly associated with SNR shocks,
indicating that the SNR shocks have not encountered very dense material. We
find that the [S II]/H-alpha ratios of X-ray-bright superbubbles are strongly
dependent on the UV radiation field of the encompassed OB associations.
Therefore, a tight correlation between [S II]/H-alpha ratio and X-ray surface

luminosity by using realistic profiles of the proto-neutron star (PNS) as well

luminosity is studied systematically. Comparisons with the analytic treatment
in the previous studies are also done. In the cases with the realistic PNS, we
found that the entropy per baryon and the expansion time scale are neither high
nor short enough for the r-process within the current assumptions. On the other
hand, we found that the expansion time scale obtained by the hydrodynamical
simulations is systematically shorter than that in the analytic solutions due
to our proper treatment of the equation of state. This fact might lead to the
increase of the neutron-to-seed ratio, which is suitable for the r-process in
the neutrino-driven wind. Indeed, in the case of massive and compact

the presence of two independent mass functions that combine in different ways
above and below a characteristic mass given by the thermal Jeans mass in the

intermediate to high mass follows primarily from the hierarchical structure of
interstellar clouds, which is sampled by various star formation processes and
converted into stars at the local dynamical rate. This power law part is
independent of the details of star formation inside each clump and therefore
has a universal character. The flat part of the IMF at low mass is proposed
here to result from a second, unrelated, physical process that determines only
the probability distribution function for final star mass inside a clump of a
given mass, and is independent of both this clump mass and the overall cloud
structure. Both processes operate for all potentially unstable clumps in a
cloud, regardless of mass, but only the first shows up above the thermal Jeans

WDM free-streaming masses, the disk galaxy formation angular momentum problem
can be completely resolved by going to the WDM structure formation scenario,
without having to invoke stellar feedback processes at all. We also confirm our
previous suspicion, that part of the angular momentum problem is due to
numerical effects, most likely related to the shock capturing, artificial
viscosity used in SPH. Furthermore we find that we can match the observed
I-band Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, provided that the I-band mass-to-light ratio
of disk galaxies is about 0.8. We argue that this is quite a reasonable value
in comparison with various dynamical and spectrophotometric estimates,
including one given in this paper. We speculate that our success in matching
the TF relation may be due to WDM halos being less centrally concentrated than
CDM halos and suggest to check this exciting possibility with high resolution
simulations, in particular in low Omega_M, WDM cosmologies. Finally, we discuss
possible physical candidates for WDM particles extensively. We find that the

instead by the cubic model at the cubic fixed point. For N=3, the critical

of the dilaton coupling to the brane. The same positive features are exhibited
in solutions found in the presence of non-vanishing cosmological constants both
on the brane (\Lambda_{br}) and in the bulk (\Lambda_B). Moreover, the
restoration of the Friedmann equation, with the correct sign, takes place for
both signs of $\Lambda_B$ so long as the sign of $\Lambda_{br}$ is opposite
$\Lambda_B$ in order to cancel the energy densities of the two cosmological
constants. We further extend our single-brane thin-wall solution to allow a
brane with finite thickness.

studied in the Standard Model on the base of investigation of symmetry
behaviour within the consistent effective potential of the scalar and magnetic
fields at finite temperature. It includes the one-loop and daisy diagram
contributions. All discovered fundamental fermions and bosons are taken into
consideration with their actual masses. The Higgs boson mass is chosen to be in
the energy interval 75 GeV $\le m_H \le$ 115 GeV. The effective potential
calculated is real at sufficiently high temperatures due to mutual cancellation
of the imaginary terms entering the one-loop and the daisy diagram parts.
Symmetry behaviour shows that neither the magnetic nor the hypermagnetic field
does not produce the sufficiently strong first order phase transition. For the
field strengths $H, H_Y$ $\ge 10^{23}$ G the electroweak phase transition is of
second order at all. Therefore, baryogenesis does not survive in the Standard
Model in smooth magnetic fields. The problems on generation of the fields at
high temperature and their stabilization are also discussed in a consistent
way. In particular, it is determined that the nonabelian component of the
magnetic field $ (gH)^{1/2} \sim g^{4/3}T$ has to be produced spontaneously. To
investigate the stability problem the $W$-boson mass operator in the magnetic
field at high temperature is calculated in one-loop approximation. The
comparison with results obtained in other approaches is done.

those arising from their correlation with the reaction plane. However, quantum
HBT correlations also produce short range azimuthal correlations between
identical particles. This creates apparent azimuthal anisotropies of a few
percent when pions are used to estimate the direction of the reaction plane.
These should not be misinterpreted as originating from collective flow. In
particular, we show that the peculiar behaviour of the directed and elliptic
flow of pions observed by NA49 at low p_T can be entirely understood in terms
of HBT correlations. Such correlations also produce apparent higher Fourier
harmonics (of order n larger than 3) of the azimuthal distribution, with
magnitudes of the order of 1%, which should be looked for in the data.

For technical reasons, the model allows maximal one meson to be present
explicitly. Thus the Hilbert space contains besides $NN$ and $N\Delta$ also
configurations consisting of two nucleons and one meson. For this reason, only
two- and three-body unitarity is obeyed, and the model is suited for reactions
in the two nucleon sector only, where one pion is produced or absorbed.
Starting from a realistic pure nucleonic retarded potential, which had to be
renormalized because of the additional $\pi$ and $\Delta$ degrees of freedom, a
reasonable fit to experimental $NN$-scattering data could be achieved.

densities (such as number, momentum, energy), and these typically evolve
according to evolution equations of hydrodynamic form. To explain the emergent
classicality of these variables from an underlying quantum theory, it is
therefore necessary to show, firstly, that these variables exhibit negligible
interference, and secondly, that the probabilities for histories of them are
peaked around hydrodynamic evolution. The implementation of this programme in
the context of the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory is
described. It is argued that, for a system of weakly interacting particles, the
eigenstates of local densities (averaged over a sufficiently large volume)
remain approximate eigenstates under time evolution. This is a consequence of
their close connection with the corresponding exactly conserved (and so exactly
decoherent) quantities. The subsequent derivation of hydrodynamic equations
from decoherent histories is discussed.
