life expectancy of an offspring may be mutated with respect to that of the
parent. While the total population of the system always reaches a steady state,
the fitness and age characteristics exhibit counter-intuitive behavior as a
function of the mutational bias. By analytical and numerical study of the
underlying rate equations, we show that if deleterious mutations are favored,
the average fitness of the population reaches a steady state, while the average
population age is a decreasing function of the overall fitness. When
advantageous mutations are favored, the average population fitness grows
linearly with time t, while the average age is independent of fitness. For no
mutational bias, the average fitness grows as t^{2/3}.

empirical relations, describing different aspects of the spectral evolution of

are: i) the hardness-intensity correlation, and ii) the hardness-photon fluence
correlation. From these we find a self-consistent, quantitative, and compact
description for the temporal evolution of pulse decay phases within a GRB light
curve. In particular, we show that in the case of the two empirical relations
both being valid, the instantaneous photon flux (intensity) must behave as
1/(1+ t/\tau) where \tau is a time constant that can be expressed in terms of
the parameters of the two empirical relations. The time evolution is fully
defined by two initial constants, and two parameters. We study a complete
sample of 83 bright GRB pulses observed by the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory

follows a reciprocal law in time. It is unclear what physics causes such a

Hydrogen-deficiency can originate from mixing and subsequent convective burning

Dredge-up alone may also be responsible for hydrogen-deficiency of post-AGB
stars. Models of the last thermal pulse on the AGB with very small envelope
masses have shown efficient third dredge-up. The hydrogen content of the
envelope is diluted sufficiently to produce H-deficient post-AGB stars (AFTP).
Moreover, dredge-up alone may also cause H-deficiency during the Born-again
phase (LTP). During the second AGB phase a convective envelope develops. A
previously unknown lithium enrichment at the surface of Born-again stellar
models may be used to distinguish between objects with different post-AGB
evolution. The observed abundance ratios of C, O and He can be reproduced by
all scenarios if an AGB starting model with inclusion of overshoot is used for
the post-AGB model sequence.

characteristics: red-shifted absorption in the far-ultraviolet O VI resonance
doublet up to +250 km/s, and extremely hard X-ray emission implying gas at
temperatures in excess of 10^7 K. We describe a phenomenological model to
explain these properties. We assume the wind of tau Sco consists of two
components: ambient gas in which denser clumps are embedded. The clumps are
optically thick in the UV resonance lines primarily responsible for
accelerating the ambient wind. The reduced acceleration causes the clumps to
slow and even infall, all the while being confined by the ram pressure of the
outflowing ambient wind. We calculate detailed trajectories of the clumps in
the ambient stellar wind, accounting for a line radiation driving force and the
momentum deposited by the ambient wind in the form of drag. We show these
clumps will fall back towards the star with velocities of several hundred
km/sec for a broad range of initial conditions. The infalling clumps produce
X-ray emitting plasmas with temperatures in excess of (1-6)x10^7 K in bow
shocks at their leading edge. The infalling material explains the peculiar
red-shifted absorption wings seen in the O VI doublet. The required mass loss
in clumps is 3% - 30% ofthe total mass loss rate. The model developed here can
be generally applied to line-driven outflows with clumps or density
irregularities. (Abstract Abridged)

cluster selection tchniques as well as a wide range in mass scale and can be
considered statistically independent. We have calculated new cluster X-ray and
optical luminosities if not available in the literature. Based on 126 systems,
our analysis shows that the total optical luminosity of a cluster is directly
proportional to the total X-ray luminosity over a wide mass range and across
all four cluster samples studied herein. We also show that total cluster
optical luminosity is a good indicator of cluster virial mass, but richness is
not. Our results suggest that (1) the selection method of galaxy clusters may
not be crucial, providing wider latitude in assembling catalogs, (2) the
luminosity per baryon does not vary systematically between systems ranging from
groups to very rich clusters. We propose that future optical catalogs of
clusters use the total optical luminosity of a cluster, instead of galaxy
richness, as luminosity appears to be a better measure of cluster mass and can
be directly related to X-ray catalogs of clusters. This will also facilitate
the first direct comparison between the growing number of X-ray and optical

speeds of visible galaxies. Upcoming redshift surveys will allow the linewidth
distribution of galaxies to be determined at both z~1 and the present day. In

from the {\it N}-body simulations of cold dark-matter halos, is a strong
candidate for a galaxy or cluster profile. In order to check the usability of
the NFW profile as a first approximation of a galaxy model, we studied the
characteristic overdensity and scale radius of galaxies by reproducing the
image positions and flux ratios of 2-image gravitational lens systems, under
the following simple assumptions: the galaxies are spherically symmetric, and
stars and external shear do not contribute to the gravitational lens. The scale
radii of the lensing galaxies are smaller, and the characteristic overdensities
are larger than the predicted value in the {\it N}-body simulations. These
results indicate that our assumptions are overly simplified. It may be
impossible to simply adopt the NFW profile, which does not include stars, to
probe the cosmological parameters or the light propagation in an inhomogeneous
universe and so on. If we adopt a softened isothermal profile to the lensing
galaxies, the scale radii and the central matter densities agree with models
which are derived from other observational results for early-type galaxies and
which are independent of gravitational lensing. The isothermal sphere as a
first approximation of a galaxy model has no serious problem.

hierarchical growth of dark matter halos, within which the baryons condense
into stars after cooling down from a hot diffuse phase. The latter is
replenished by infall of outer gas into the halo potential wells; this includes
a fraction previously expelled and preheated, due to momentum and energy fed
back by the SNe which follow the star formation. We identify such an implied
hot phase with the medium known to radiate powerful X-rays in clusters and in

the current star formation models is enough to be observable out to redshifts
$z \approx 1.5$ in forthcoming deep surveys from {\it Chandra} and {\it XMM},
especially in case the star formation rate is high at such and earlier $z$.

reddening-corrected color, $(\mv-\mi)_0=1.06\pm0.21$, we infer a temperature
$\Teff=4800\pm800 $K. The white-dwarf mass is known accurately from
measurements of the Shapiro delay of the pulsar signal,
$\Mcomp=0.258^{+0.028}_{-0.016} \Msun$. Hence, given a cooling model, one can
use the measured temperature to determine the cooling age. The main uncertainty
in the cooling models for such low-mass white dwarfs is the amount of residual
nuclear burning, which is set by the thickness of the hydrogen layer
surrounding the helium core. From the properties of similar systems, it has
been inferred that helium white dwarfs form with thick hydrogen layers, with
mass $\simgt3\times10^{-3} \Msun$, which leads to significant additional
heating. This is consistent with expectations from simple evolutionary models
of the preceding binary evolution. For PSR B1855+09, though, such models lead
to a cooling age of $\sim10 $Gyr, which is twice the spin-down age of the
pulsar. It could be that the spin-down age were incorrect, which would call the
standard vacuum dipole braking model into question. For two other pulsar
companions, however, ages well over 10 Gyr are inferred, indicating that the
problem may lie with the cooling models. There is no age discrepancy for models
in which the white dwarfs are formed with thinner hydrogen layers
($\simlt3\times10^{-4} \Msun$).

stands out for its high redshift $z\ge 3$ and the Ly$\alpha$ emission line

of the expanding supershell. From a profile fitting analysis we estimate the
expansion velocity of the supershell $v_{exp} = 1500\kms$ and the neutral
column density $N_{HI}=10^{20}\cm^{-2}$. The redshift $z=3.418$ of the host
galaxy proposed by Kulkarni et al. (1998) has been revised to be $z=3.425$ from
our profile analysis. The observed Ly$\alpha$ profile is fitted well by a
Gaussian curve, which yields the Ly$\alpha$ luminosity
$L_{Ly\alpha}=(1.8\pm0.8)\times10^{42}\ergs \s^{-1}$. Assuming that the photon
source is a giant H II region, we deduce the electron number density in the H
II region $n_e=(40\pm10) ({R \over {100 \pc}})^{-1.5}\cm^{-3}$, which
corresponds to the illumination by about $10^4$ O5 stars. We estimate the
star-formation rate to be $R_{SF} = (7\pm3){\rm M}_\odot\yr^{-1}$ with the
internal and the Galactic extinction corrected. The theory on the evolution of
supernova remnants is used to propose that the supershell is at the adiabatic
phase, with its radius $R = 18 E_{53}^{1/2} \pc$, its age $t = 4.7\times10^3\
E_{53}^{1/2} \yrs$, and the density of the ambient medium $n_1 = 5.4\
E_{53}^{-1/2}\cm^{-3}$, where $E_{53}= E/10^{53}\ergs$.And we estimate the
kinetic energy of the supershell to be $E_k=7.3\times10^{52} E_{53} \ergs$.
These values are consistent with the hypothesis that the supershell is the

potential is determined by the functional integral corresponding to the phi^4
theory with a `wrong' sign of the interaction constant. The special role of the
dimension d=4 for such a problem can be seen from different viewpoints but is
fundamentally determined by the renormalizability of the theory. The
construction of an epsilon-expansion in direct analogy with the
phase-transition theory gives rise to the problem of a `spurious' pole. To
solve this problem, a proper treatment of the factorial divergency of the
perturbation series is necessary. Simplifications arising in high dimensions
can be used for the development of a (4-epsilon)-dimensional theory, but this
requires successive consideration of four types of theories: a
nonrenormalizable theory for d>4, nonrenormalizable and renormalizable theories
in the logarithmic situation (d=4), and a super-renormalizable theory for d<4.
An approximation is found for each type of theory giving asymptotically exact
results. The qualitative effect is the same in all four cases and consists in a
shifting of the phase transition point in the complex plane. This results in
the elimination of the `spurious' pole and in regularity of the density of
states for all energies. A discussion is given of the calculation of high
orders of perturbation theory and a perspective of the epsilon-expansion for
the problem of conductivity near the Anderson transition.

two generalized Bloch equations proposed in this work. The first form of the
generalized Bloch equation is linear, but with a temperature-dependent

correlated diffusion equation (porous medium equation). Furthermore, we can

localized oscillations, or one/two unbound attractors corresponding to directed
movement in the ratchet potential. Considering an ensemble of particles, we
show that in the deterministic case two currents into different directions can
occur, which however depend on a supercritical supply of energy. Considering
stochastic influences, we find the current only in one direction. We further
investigate how the current reversal depends on the strength of the stochastic
force and the asymmetry of the potential. We find both a critical value of the
noise intensity for the onset of the current and an optimal value where the net
current reaches a maximum. Eventually, the dynamics of our model is compared

neutrality conditions by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. We observe that
sequence space is traversed by neutral networks, i.e. sets of sequences with
the same fold connected by point mutations. Typical pairs of sequences on a
neutral network are nearly as different as randomly chosen sequences. The
fraction of neutral neighbors has strong sequence to sequence variations, which
influence the rate of neutral evolution. In this paper we study the
thermodynamic stability of different protein sequences. We relate the high
variability of the fraction of neutral mutations to the complex energy
landscape within a neutral network, arguing that valleys in this landscape are
associated to high values of the neutral mutation rate. We find that when a
point mutation produces a sequence with a new ground state, this is likely to
have a low stability. Thus we tentatively conjecture that neutral networks of
different structures are typically well separated in sequence space. This
results indicates that changing significantly a protein structure through a
biologically acceptable chain of point mutations is a rare, although possible,

Product expansion. In the most interesting case of QCD, there is yet no
derivation of short strings and we turn to phenomenology to find evidence pro
or contra their existence. The short strings in QCD lead to non-standard power
corrections. A tentative conclusion of the analysis of existing data, both in
numerical simulations and in real experiments, is that the novel power
corrections are present, at least at the mass scale of 1-2 GeV.

modified Bianchi identity appears to depend on an arbitrary parameter b, we
show that requiring G to be globally well-defined, i.e. invariant under small
and large gauge and local Lorentz transformations, fixes b=1. This value also
is necessary for a consistent reduction to the heterotic string in the
small-radius limit. Insisting on properly defining all fields on the circle, we
find that there is a previously unnoticed additional contribution to the
anomaly inflow from the eleven-dimensional topological term. Anomaly
cancellation then requires a quadratic relation between b and the combination
lambda^6/kappa^4 of the gauge and gravitational coupling constants lambda and
kappa. This contrasts with previous beliefs that anomaly cancellation would
give a cubic equation for b. We observe that our solution for G automatically
satisfies integer or half-integer flux quantization for the appropriate cycles.
We explicitly write out the anomaly cancelling terms of the heterotic string as
inherited from the M-theory approach. They differ from the usual ones by the
addition of a well-defined local counterterm. We also show how five-branes

  lattices","57 pages",,,,"math.CO math-ph math.MP math.PR nlin.SI",,"  Matrix Fourier-like integrals over the classical groups O_+(n), O_-(n), Sp(n)
and U(n) are connected with the distribution of the length of the longest
increasing sequence in random permutations and random involutions and the
spectrum of random matrices. One of the purposes of this paper is to show that
all those integrals satisfy the Painlev\'e V equation with specific initial
conditions. In this work, we present both, new results and known ones, in a
unified way.
  Our method consists of inserting one set of time variables t=(t_1,t_2,...) in
the integrals for the real compact groups and two sets of times (t,s) for the
unitary group. The point is that these new time-dependent integrals satisfy
integrable hierarchies:
  (i) O(n) and Sp(n) correspond to the standard Toda lattice. (ii) U(n)
corresponds to the Toeplitz lattice, a very special reduction of the discrete
sinh-Gordon equation.
  Both systems, the standard Toda lattice and the Toeplitz lattice are also
reductions of the 2-Toda lattice, thus leading to a natural vertex operator,
and so, a natural Virasoro algebra, a subalgebra of which annihilates the
tau-functions. Combining these equations leads to the Painlev\'e V equation for
the integrals.

caused by scattering, decay, etc.). After reviewing how this information has
been previously exploited by others, we describe extensions which add power to
breakpoint detection and characterization. We show how complete fits to the
entire track, with breakpoint parameters added, can be easily obtained from the
information from unbroken fits. Tests inspired by the Fisher F-test can then be
used to judge breakpoints. Signed quantities (such as change in momentum at the
breakpoint) can supplement unsigned quantities such as the various chisquares.
We illustrate the method with electrons from real data, and with Monte Carlo
simulations of pion decays.
