demonstrates that if the putative magnetars are indeed isolated neutron stars,
their unusual attributes cannot be only a consequence of their large inferred

that ejecta from stellar winds combined with supernovae of type II failed to

(modeled as magnetic dipole radiation). Our phenomenological description of
nonlinear r-modes is similar to, but distinct from, that of Owen et al. (1998)
in that our treatment is consistent with the principle of adiabatic invariance
in the limit when direct driving and damping of the mode are absent. We show
that, while magnetic braking tends to increase the r-mode amplitude by spinning
down the neutron star, it nevertheless reduces the efficiency of gravitational
wave emission from the star. For B >= 10^14 (\nus/300 Hz)^2 G, where \nus is
the spin frequency, the spindown rate and the gravitational waveforms are
significantly modified by the effect of magnetic braking. We also estimate the
growth rate of the r-mode due to electromagnetic (fast magnetosonic) wave
emission and due to Alfven wave emission in the neutron star magnetosphere. The
Alfven wave driving of the r-mode becomes more important than the gravitational
radiation driving when B >= 10^13 (\nus/150 Hz)^3 G; the electromagnetic wave
driving of the r-mode is much weaker. Finally, we study the properties of local
Rossby-Alfven waves inside the neutron star and show that the fractional change

tidally locked binaries, such as the RS CVns. We show that two of the three
X-ray detected black hole binaries (A0620-00 and GRO J1655-40) exhibit X-ray
fluxes entirely consistent with coronal emission. The X-ray spectra of these
objects should be best fit with thermal Raymond-Smith models rich in lines when
coronal emission predominates. One black hole system (V404 Cyg) is too X-ray
bright to be explained as coronal emission. The quiescent X-ray emission from
the neutron star binaries is far too bright for coronal emission. It might be
that all SXT's have variable accretion rates in quiescence and that the basal
quiescent X-ray flux is set by either coronal emission from the companion or --
when present -- by thermal emission from the neutron star. We also show that
the lithium abundances in the black hole systems are comparable to those in the
RS CVns, reducing the need for production mechanisms that involve the compact
object.

suffered a single scattering event can be larger by up to 50 per cent in the
former case. This should affect the photon exchange between cold accretion
disks and hot coronae or ADAF flows in the vicinity of relativistic compact
objects; as well as the rate of cooling (through multiple inverse-Compton
scattering of seed photons supplied from outside) of optically thick clouds of
relativistic electrons in compact radiosources. The forward-backward scattering
asymmetry also causes spatial diffusion of photons to proceed slower in hot
plasma than in cold one, which is important for the shapes of Comptonization
spectra and the time delays between soft and hard radiations coming from
variable X-ray sources.

persistent current, typically on the order of the Thouless energy, $ e/\tau_D$,
is much larger than the theoretical results, obtained with or without electron
interaction. In considering the phenomenology of both decoherence and
persistent current, usually observed in similar systems, we argue towards a
dynamic role played by decoherence in the generation of a persistent current. A
field-induced phase shift from near-equilibrium high-frequency
fluctuations---which otherwise gives rise to decoherence---under certain
conditions of periodicity and asymmetry due to disorder, is argued to induce a
steady state diffusion current on the order of $e/\tau_D$, comparable to the
observed persistent current.

what level depends on the dissipation depth and other physical parameters. For
LIGO II, the high breaking strength of pristine fused silica filaments, the
correct choice of ribbon aspect ratio (to minimize thermoelastic damping), and
low dissipation depth combined with the other achievable parameters can reduce
the pendulum mode thermal noise in a ribbon suspension well below the radiation
pressure noise. Despite producing higher levels of pendulum mode thermal noise,
cylindrical fiber suspensions provide an acceptable alternative for LIGO II,

superstructure of a web of lumps in a stochastic discrete network structure. As
in preceding work (mentioned below), our analysis is based on the working
philosophy that both physics and the corresponding mathematics have to be
genuinely discrete on the primordial (Planck scale) level. This strategy is
concretely implemented in the form of \tit{cellular networks} and \tit{random
graphs}. One of our main themes is the development of the concept of
\tit{physical (proto)points} or \tit{lumps} as densely entangled subcomplexes
of the network and their respective web, establishing something like
\tit{(proto)causality}. It may perhaps be said that certain parts of our
programme are realisations of some early ideas of Menger and more recent ones
sketched by Smolin a couple of years ago. We briefly indicate how this
\tit{two-story-concept} of \tit{quantum} space-time can be used to encode the
(at least in our view) existing non-local aspects of quantum theory without
violating macroscopic space-time causality.

this framework the kinematical acceleration of the cosmic fluid or,

Carlo lattice configurations, I compare hadron spectroscopy on this instanton

the zero mode zone in simple instances I find that the optimised action gives a
satisfactory description of it. Through the Banks-Casher formula, instantons by
themselves are shown to break chiral symmetry but hadron correlators on the
instanton backgrounds are strongly influenced by free quark propagation. This
results in unnaturally light hadrons and a small splitting between the vector
and the pseudoscalar meson channels. Superimposing a perturbative ensemble of
zero momentum gauge field fluctuations (torons) on the instantons is found to
be enough to eliminate the free quarks and restore the physical hadron
correlators. I argue that the torons that are present only in finite volumes,
are probably needed to compensate the unnaturally large finite size effects due
to the lack of confinement in the instanton ensemble.

using full phase space distribution function and also with inclusion of quantum
statistics i.e. Pauli blocking and Bose enhancement factors, in the case of
both saturated and unsaturated quark gluon plasma. The rate for the process $gg
\rightleftharpoons q{\bar q}$ is found to be much less as compared to the most
commonly used factorized result obtained on the basis of classical
approximation. This discrepancy, which is found both at zero as well as at
finite baryon densities, however, is not due to the lack of quantum statistics
in the classical approximation, rather due to the use of Fermi-Dirac and
Bose-Einstein distribution functions for partons instead of Boltzmann
distribution which is appropriate under such approximation. Interestingly, the
rates of parton production are found to be insensitive to the baryo-chemical
potential particularly when the plasma is unsaturated although the process of
chemical equilibration strongly depends on it. The thermal photon yields, have
been calculated specifically from unsaturated plasma at finite baryon density.
The exact results obtained numerically are found to be in close agreement with
the analytic expression derived using factorized distribution functions
appropriate for unsaturated plasma. Further, it is shown that in the case of
unsaturated plasma, the thermal photon production is enhanced with increasing
baryon density both at fixed temperature and fixed energy density of the quark
gluon plasma.

Anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk. The resulting space-time has compact spatial
sections bounded by the brane. During inflation, the continuum of KK modes is
separated from the massless zero mode by the gap $m=(3/2) H$, where $H$ is the
Hubble rate. We consider the analog of the Nariai solution and argue that it
describes pair production of ``Black cigars'' attached to the inflating brane.
In the case when the size of the instantons is much larger than the AdS radius,
the 5-dimensional action agrees with the 4-dimensional one. Hence, the 5D and
4D gravitational entropies are the same in this limit. We also consider thermal
instantons with an AdS black hole in the bulk. These may be interpreted as
describing the creation of a hot universe from nothing, or the production of
AdS black holes in the vicinity of a pre-existing inflating brane-world. The
Lorentzian evolution of the brane-world after creation is briefly discussed. An
additional ""integration constant"" in the Friedmann equation -accompanying a
term which dilutes like radiation- describes the tidal force in the fifth
direction and arises from the mass of a spherical object inside the bulk. This
could be a 5-dimensional black hole or a ""parallel"" brane-world of negative
tension concentrical with our brane-world. In the case of thermal solutions,
and in the spirit of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence, one may attribute the
additional term to thermal radiation in the boundary theory. Then, for
temperatures well below the AdS scale, the entropy of this radiation agrees
with the entropy of the black hole in the AdS bulk.

$\scri$, and that of the spacetime interior to this boundary. We prove as a
simple corollary of topological censorship that any asymptotically anti-de
Sitter spacetime with a disconnected boundary-at-infinity necessarily contains
black hole horizons which screen the boundary components from each other. This
corollary may be viewed as a Lorentzian analog of the Witten and Yau result
hep-th/9910245, but is independent of the scalar curvature of $\scri$.
Furthermore, the topology of V', the Cauchy surface (as defined for
asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetime with boundary-at-infinity) for regions
exterior to event horizons, is constrained by that of $\scri$. In this paper,
we prove a generalization of the homology results in gr-qc/9902061 in arbitrary

number of boundaries $\Sigma_i$ interior to $\Sigma_0$. As a consequence, V
does not contain any wormholes or other compact, non-simply connected

constraints and the onto homomorphism of the fundamental groups from which they
follow are sufficient to limit the topology of interior of V to either B^2 or

conformal field theories. They are not unitary, but have a variety of
interesting properties. Bosonic conformal tensors have a positive-definite
action, equal to the square of a field strength, and a higher-derivative gauge
invariance. There exists a conserved spin-2 current (not the canonical stress
tensor) defining positive central charges c and a. I calculate the values of c
and a and study the operator-product structure. Higher-spin conformal spinors
have no gauge invariance, admit a standard definition of c and a and can be
coupled to Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields in a renormalizable way. At the
quantum level, they contribute to the one-loop beta function with the same sign
as ordinary matter, admit a conformal window and non-trivial interacting fixed
points. There are composite operators of high spin and low dimension, which
violate the Ferrara-Gatto-Grillo theorem. Finally, other theories, such as
conformal antisymmetric tensors, exhibit more severe internal problems. This
research is motivated by the idea that fundamental quantum field theories
should be renormalization-group (RG) interpolations between ultraviolet and
infrared conformal fixed points, and quantum irreversibility should be a
general principle of nature.

selected and chosen mass-independent if masslessness is not realized, this with
the aim of expressing the effect of an infinitesimal change in $c$ on the
computed observables. This change is found to be expressible in terms of an
equation involving a vector field $V$ on the action's space $M$ (coordinates
x). This equation is often referred to as ``evolution equation'' in physics.
This vector field generates a one-parameter (here $c$) group of diffeomorphisms
on $M$. Its flow $\sigma_c (x)$ can indeed be shown to satisfy the functional
equation $$ \sigma_{c+t} (x) = \sigma_c (\sigma_t (x)) \equiv \sigma_c \circ
\sigma_t $$ $$\sigma_0 (x) = x,$$ so that the very appearance of $V$ in the
evolution equation implies at once the Gell-Mann-Low functional equation. The
latter appears therefore as a trivial consequence of the existence of a vector
field on the action's space of renormalized QFT.

forms an increasing chain of algebras depending on a parameter s>0 is
constructed. The value of the parameter for which the mentioned algebras are
well behaved, commutative and unital is found. In particular a privileged

of analytic functions whose q-moments have a particular behaviour. The same
result makes it possible to extend results on invertibility of the q-Fourier

before the rms-radius was determined by a fit which allows free normalization
for each experiment. It is shown that an analysis of electron scattering data

classical data while the other is described by standard quantum data. These
dynamical systems will be named half quantum. The aim of this paper is to
derive the dynamical evolution of a general half quantum system from its full
quantum formulation. The standard approach would be to use quantum mechanics to
make predictions for the time evolution of the half quantum initial data. The
main problem is how can quantum mechanics be applied to a dynamical system
whose initial time configuration is not described by a set of fully quantum
data. A solution to this problem is presented and used, as a guideline to
obtain a general formulation of coupled classical-quantum dynamics. Finally, a
quantization prescription mapping a given classical theory to the correspondent
half quantum one is presented.

more photons induced by backaction evasion quantum nondemolition measurements
of a quadrature component x of the vacuum light field state are strongly
correlated with the quadrature component measurement results. This correlation
corresponds to the operator expectation value <xnx> which is equal to one
fourth for the vacuum even though the photon number eigenvalue is zero. Quantum
nondemolition measurements of a quadrature component can thus provide
experimental evidence of the nonclassical operator ordering dependence of the
correlations between photon number and field components in the vacuum state.

advantage of this cipher system is that it operates above noise level.
Therefore computationally secure communication can be done when error

physical systems and specify single-time joint probabilities of these
properties. We show that a natural extension, applying to properties at several
times, can be given if a decoherence condition is satisfied. This extension
defines ""consistent histories"" of modal properties. We suggest a new form of
the modal scheme, that offers prospects of a more general applicability of the
histories concept. Finally, we discuss a possible way of applying these ideas
to relativistic quantum field theory.
