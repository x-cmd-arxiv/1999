adopted exponential disk model (i.e. both the stars and the dust are

particular, model images of galaxies with logarithmic spiral arms are
constructed, such that the azimuthally averaged disk is exponential in radius

the real values used to create the spiral-structured images. It turns out that
the plain exponential disk model is able to give a very good description of the

lenticular/S0 galaxies in the dense environment of rich clusters for look-back
times of more than half the age of the Universe. In addition, new data are
presented for the cluster Abell 2218.
  Scaling relations like the Fundamental Plane provide strong evidence that
luminous ellipticals evolve purely passively up to redshifts of z=0.8 implying
that no significant new stellar population was created during that time. This
picture is supported by tight Mg-sigma and colour-magnitude relations at
various redshifts and age/metallicity diagnostic diagrams. On the other hand,
there is a strong decline in the frequency of S0 galaxies with redshift, while
a significant proportion of the galaxies have disturbed morphologies and signs
of ongoing interaction/merging. Numerous post-starburst galaxies are found as
well as passive spiral galaxies. This raises the question whether the spiral
galaxies falling into the cluster from the surrounding field could be
transformed into S0 galaxies. A possible scenario would be that the
intracluster medium first deprives the spirals of all their gas leading to the
end of star formation. The subsequent evolution within the tidal field of the
cluster could then turn the spirals into S0 galaxies over the ages.
  The study of a great number of early-type galaxies per cluster including
sub-L* galaxies reveals, however, that this picture needs some finetuning since
the relations mentioned above have a larger spread than those based on the
observation of just a few luminous galaxies. First results are presented for 48
early-type galaxies in the cluster Abell 2218 at a redshift of z=0.18.

  1999",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Mergers of black-hole binaries are expected to release large amounts of
energy in the form of gravitational radiation. However, binary evolution models
predict merger rates too low to be of observational interest. In this paper we
explore the possibility that black holes become members of close binaries via
dynamical interactions with other stars in dense stellar systems. In star
clusters, black holes become the most massive objects within a few tens of
millions of years; dynamical relaxation then causes them to sink to the cluster
core, where they form binaries. These black-hole binaries become more tightly
bound by superelastic encounters with other cluster members, and are ultimately
ejected from the cluster. The majority of escaping black-hole binaries have
orbital periods short enough and eccentricities high enough that the emission
of gravitational waves causes them to coalesce within a few billion years. We
predict a black-hole merger rate of 10^-8 to 10^-7 per year per cubic
megaparsec, implying gravity-wave detection rates substantially greater than
the corresponding rates from neutron star mergers. For the first generation
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO-I), we expect about
one detection during the first two years of operation. For its successor
LIGO-II, the rate rises to roughly one detection per day. There is about an
order of magnitude uncertainty in these numbers.

the neutron star atmosphere models increase the radius and reduce the

expected for a young neutron star. One cannot exclude, however, that the
observed emission originates from hot spots on a cooler neutron star surface.
Because of strong interstellar absorption, the possible low-temperature
component gives a small contribution to the observed spectrum; an upper limit
on the (gravitationally redshifted) surface temperature is < 1.9-2.3 MK.
Amongst several possible interpretations, we favor a model of a strongly
magnetized neutron star with magnetically confined hydrogen or helium polar
caps on a cooler iron surface. Alternatively, the observed radiation may be
interpreted as emitted by a compact object (more likely, a black hole)
accreting from a fossil disk or from a late-type dwarf in a close binary.

more metal-poor than those more nearby. We also find that the slope of the

those stars more distant. These results are most likely an artifact of
selection biases in the Edvardsson et al. star sample. We conclude that the

Att(\lambda), based on the measurement of F(IR)/F(\lambda) flux ratio. Our
calibration is based on spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the PEGASE
stellar evolutionary synthesis model and the effects of dust (absorption and
scattering) as calculated from our Monte Carlo radiative transfer model. We
tested the attenuations predicted from this method for the Balmer emission

properties (grain type, distribution, and clumpiness). For the UV, the
relationship is also independent of the assumed stellar properties (age,

postulated in Kazanas (1989). For models with enhanced mass loss, the
zero-intensity-full-widths of the line profiles are proportional to the black
hole mass to the power of 1/3. This scaling relation suggests that the black
hole masses of NLS1s (narrow-line Seyfert 1s) are relatively low. Models with
enhanced mass loss also predict minimum line/continuum delays that are
proportional to the zero-intensity-full-widths of the profiles. Because of
their high column densities, these models yield triangle-shaped response
functions, which are not generally observed. On the other hand, models without
enhanced mass loss yield line-continuum delays that are proportional to the
square root of the continuum luminosity, which is constant with empirical
results. Models with high enough intercloud (interstellar) medium densities and

Testing based on spherical harmonics of each class, in equatorial coordinates,
is presented. Because the sky exposure function of BATSE instrument is not
dependent on the right ascension $\alpha$, any non-zero spherical harmonic
proportional either to $P_n^m(\sin \delta) \sin m \alpha$ or to $P_n^m(\sin
\delta) \cos m\alpha$ with $m \neq 0$ ($\delta$ is the declination),
immediately indicates an intrinsic non-zero term. It is a somewhat surprising
result that the ""intermediate"" subclass shows an intrinsic anisotropy at the
$97\%$ significance level caused by the high non-zero $P_3^1(\sin \delta) \sin
m \alpha$ harmonic. The remaining two subclasses, and the full sample of GRBs,
remain isotropic.

close to Gaussian statistics. The constraints from the CMB are beginning to be

huge voids are found even in the immediate neighborhood of the stars. Synthetic

observational discrimination between them to be possible. Colliding wind models
also provide a link between symbiotics and planetary nebulae. Accretion during

model (linear coupling of the particle with a thermal bath with a continuum of
modes, proportional to the frequency at low frequency). As a result, at any
temperature, the displacement correlation function exhibits aging, i.e. it
depends explicitly on both times involved and not only on their difference,
even in the limit of large age (or waiting time), in contrast with a dynamic
variable in equilibrium such as the particle velocity. The equilibrium quantum
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (QFDT) has to be modified in order to relate
the displacement response and correlation functions, since this latter quantity
takes into account even those fluctuations of the displacement which take place
during the waiting time. We describe the deviation from the equilibrium QFDT in
terms of an effective temperature which depends both on the time difference and
of the waiting time. The definition of this quantity heavily relies on the
time-dependent diffusion coefficient. The behavior of the effective temperature
as a function of the time difference for given values of the bath temperature
and of the waiting time is analyzed.

the full momentum dependent quantum kinetic equations. We study the parameter
region $10^{-2} \stackrel{<}{\sim} |\delta m^2|/eV^2\le 10^3$. For a large
range of $\sin^2 2\theta_0$ values the sign of the neutrino asymmetry is fixed
and does not oscillate. For values of mixing parameters in the region
$10^{-6}\stackrel{<}{\sim}\sin^{2}2\theta_{0}\stackrel{<}{\sim} 3\times 10^{-4}
({\rm eV}^{2}/|\delta m^{2}|)$, the neutrino asymmetry appears to undergo rapid
oscillations during the period where the exponential growth occurs. Our
numerical results indicate that the oscillations are able to change the
neutrino asymmetry sign. The sensitivity of the solutions and in particular of
the final sign of lepton number to small changes in the initial conditions
depends whether the number of oscillations is high enough. It is however not
possible to conclude whether this effect is induced by the presence of a
numerical error or is an intrinsic feature. As the amplitude of the statistical
fluctuations is much lower than the numerical error, our numerical analysis
cannot demonstrate the possibility of a chaotical generation of lepton domains.
In any case this possibility is confined to a special region in the space of
mixing parameters and it cannot spoil the compatibility of the
$\nu_{\mu}\leftrightarrow\nu_{s}$ solution to the neutrino atmospheric data
obtained assuming a small mixing of the $\nu_{s}$ with an ${\rm eV}-\tau$
neutrino.

distinguish two types of quintessences, a metrical quintessence which couples
to the particle physics sector {\it only} through the mixing with the spacetime
metric and a non-metrical one without such property. It is stressed that these
two types of quintessences have quite different features in regard to the fine
tuning of parameters required for the flat potential, as well as different
implications for the quintessence-mediated long range force. The fine tuning
argument strongly suggests that non-metrical quintessence should correspond to
the Goldstone boson of an almost exact nonlinear global symmetry whose explicit
breaking by quantum gravity effects is highly suppressed. It is briefly
discussed whether the radion field in higher dimensional theories can be a
candidate for metrical quintessence. We finally discuss the possibility that
string/$M$ theory axion corresponds to a Goldstone-type quintessence, and argue
that a certain combination of the heterotic $M$ theory or Type I string theory
axions can be a good candidate for quintessence if some conditions on the

satisfy our differential equation, they are not extremal curves. We construct
examples of extremal curves and find how the length of these curves depends on
the dimensions of the torus. The intersections with the Gribov horizon are
determined explicitly. The results are discussed in the context of Feynman's
ideas about the origin of the mass gap.

positivity for probabilities, prior models have to implement all the specific,
and often vague, ""a priori"" knowledge available for a specific task.
Nonparametric prior models discussed in the paper are Gaussian processes,
mixtures of Gaussian processes, and non-quadratic potentials. Prior models are
made flexible by including hyperparameters. In particular, the adaption of mean
functions and covariance operators of Gaussian process components is discussed
in detail. Even if constructed using Gaussian process building blocks, Bayesian
field theories are typically non-Gaussian and have thus to be solved
numerically. According to increasing computational resources the class of
non-Gaussian Bayesian field theories of practical interest which are
numerically feasible is steadily growing. Models which turn out to be
computationally too demanding can serve as starting point to construct easier
to solve parametric approaches, using for example variational techniques.

decoherence due to the leakage of photons through the cavity mirrors is
suppressed. We show how the states of the subspace can be entangled with the
help of weak laser pulses, using the high decay rate of the cavity field and
strong coupling between the atoms and the resonator mode. The atoms remain
decoherence-free with a probability which can, in principle, be arbitrarily
close to unity.

description of the measurement process in quantum mechanics has a modern day
version in the decoherence approach. We claim that this approach and the de
Broglie-Bohm theory emerges from Bohr's interpretation and are therefore
obliged to deal with some obscures ideas which were antecipated, explicitly or
implicitly and carefully circumvented, by Bohr.

equation. It is pointed out that the expression for the energy functional for
this modification is not unique as the field-theoretical definition of energy
does not coincide with the quantum-mechanical one. As a result, this
modification can be formulated in three different ways depending on which
physically relevant properties one aims to preserve. Some nonstationary
one-dimensional solutions for suitably chosen potentials, including a KdV
soliton, are presented, and the question of finding stationary solutions is
also discussed. The analysis of physical and mathematical features of the
modification leads to the conclusion that the Staruszkiewicz modification is a
very subtle modification of the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics.
