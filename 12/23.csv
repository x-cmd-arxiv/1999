in supernova-like events. Two kinds of ``collapsar'' models are discussed,
those in which the black hole forms promptly - a second or so after iron core
collapse - and those in which formation occurs later, following ``fallback''
over a period of minutes to hours. In most cases, extraction of energy from a
rapidly accreting disk (and a rapidly rotating black hole) is achieved by
magnetohydrodynamical processes, although neutrino-powered models remain viable
in cases where the accretion rate is >0.05 solar masses per second. GRBs are
but one observable phenomenon accompanying black hole birth and other
possibilities are discussed, some of which (long, faint GRBs and soft x-ray
transients) may await discovery. Since they all involve black holes of similar
mass accreting one to several M\sun, collapsars have a nearly standard total
energy, around 10**52 erg, but both the fraction of that energy ejected as
highly relativistic matter and the distribution of that energy with angle can

medium environment. Recently, Frail {et al}. (1999a) found that the latter two
cases are consistent with the radio afterglow of this burst. Here, by
considering the trans-relativistic shock hydrodynamics, we show that the dense
medium model can also account for the radio light curve quite well. The
potential virtue of the dense medium model for GRB{980519} is that it implies a
smaller angular size of the afterglow, which is essential for interpreting the
strong modulation of the radio light curve. Optical extinction due to the dense
medium is not important if the prompt optical-UV flash accompanying the

two-body relaxation, mass segregation from equipartition of energy, stellar
collisions, stellar mergers, core collapse, and tidal disruption. This review
briefly summarizes some of the tremendous developments that have taken place
during the last two decades. It ends with some recent results on tidal tails
around galactic globular clusters and on a very massive globular cluster in

stars: HD 44179 (=AFGL 915, the `Red Rectangle'); HD 56126; and, tentatively,
the carbon star V Hya. This brings to seven the number of evolved star
envelopes in which CI has been detected. Upper limits were found for several
other stars, including R CrB. CI was not detected in several oxygen rich post
asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (OH231.8+4.2, for example), although it is
detected in their carbon-rich analogues. Two trends are evident in the data.
First, circumstellar envelopes with detectable CI are overwhelmingly carbon
rich, suggesting that much of the CI is produced by the dissociation of
molecules other than CO. Second, the more evolved the envelope away from the
AGB, the higher is the CI/CO ratio. The oxygen-rich supergiant star Alpha Ori
remains the only oxygen rich star with a wind containing detectable CI. These
data suggest an evolutionary sequence for the CI/CO ratio in cool circumstellar
envelopes. This ratio is small (a few %) while the star is on the AGB, and the
CI is located in the outer envelope and produced by photodissociation. The
ratio increases to about 0.5 as the star evolves away from the AGB because of
the dissociation of CO and other carbon-bearing molecules by shocks caused by
the fast winds which appear at the end of evolution on the AGB. Finally, the
ratio becomes >> 1 as the central star becomes hot enough to photodissociate
CO.

tunneling via quantum point contacts and global classical percolation, has been
introduced in order to describe the observed ``metal-insulator transition'' in
two dimensions [1]. Here, based upon that model, a two-species-percolation
scaling theory is introduced and compared to the experimental data. The two
species in this model are, on one hand, the ``metallic'' point contacts, whose
critical energy lies below the Fermi energy, and on the other hand, the
insulating quantum point contacts. It is shown that many features of the
experiments, such as the exponential dependence of the resistance on
temperature on the metallic side, the linear dependence of the exponent on
density, the $e^2/h$ scale of the critical resistance, the quenching of the
metallic phase by a parallel magnetic field and the non-monotonic dependence of
the critical density on a perpendicular magnetic field, can be naturally
explained by the model.
  Moreover, details such as the nonmonotonic dependence of the resistance on
temperature or the inflection point of the resistance vs. parallel magnetic are
also a natural consequence of the theory. The calculated parallel field
dependence of the critical density agrees excellently with experiments, and is
used to deduce an experimental value of the confining energy in the vertical
direction. It is also shown that the resistance on the ``metallic'' side can
decrease with decreasing temperature by an arbitrary factor in the degenerate
regime ($T\lesssim E_F$).

dot in a magnetic field are determined by numerical diagonalization. In the
strong correlation regime, the low-energy eigenstates show Aharonov-Bohm type
oscillations, which decrease in amplitude as the field increases. These
oscillations, including the decrease in amplitude, may be reproduced to good
accuracy by an extended Hubbard model in a basis of localized one-electron
Hartree states. The hopping matrix element, $t$, comprises the usual kinetic
energy term plus a term derived from the Coulomb interaction. The latter is
essential to get good agreement with exact results. The phase of $t$ gives rise
to the usual Peierls factor, related to the flux through a square defined by
the peaks of the Hartree wavefunctions. The magnitude of $t$ decreases slowly
with magnetic field as the Hartree functions become more localized, giving rise
to the decreasing amplitude of the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations.

the path-integral method whose use can be justified only in the thin-wall and

the wave function in the region where the scale factor of the metric is
sufficiently small compared with the inverse of the typical energy scale of the

incorporates consistently all lowest-order (1PN) relativistic effects, as well
as gravitational radiation reaction, the lowest-order dissipative term in
general relativity. We test our code on sequences of single NS models of
varying compactness, and we discuss ways to make PN simulations more relevant
to realistic NS models. We also present a PN SPH relaxation procedure for
constructing equilibrium models of synchronized binaries, and we use these
equilibrium models as initial conditions for our dynamical calculations of
binary coalescence. Though unphysical, since tidal synchronization is not
expected in NS binaries, these initial conditions allow us to compare our PN
work with previous Newtonian results.
  We compare calculations with and without 1PN effects, for NS with stiff
equations of state, modeled as polytropes with $\Gamma=3$. We find that 1PN
effects can play a major role in the coalescence, accelerating the final
inspiral and causing a significant misalignment in the binary just prior to
final merging. In addition, the character of the gravitational wave signal is
altered dramatically, showing strong modulation of the exponentially decaying
waveform near the end of the merger. We also discuss briefly the implications
of our results for models of gamma-ray bursts at cosmological distances.

to measure the lepton mixing angle theta_13. We suppose that intense neutrino
and antineutrino beams will become available in so-called neutrino factories.
We find that the most promising and statistically significant results can be
obtained by studying nu_e ->nu_mu and \bar{nu}_e-> \bar{nu}_mu oscillations
which lead to matter enhancements and suppressions of wrong sign muon rates. We
show the theta_13 ranges where matter effects could be observed as a function
of the baseline. We discuss the scaling laws of rates, significances and
sensitivities with the relevant mixing angles and experimental parameters. Our
analysis includes fluxes, event rates and statistical aspects so that the
conclusions should be useful for the planning of experimental setups. We
discuss the subleading Delta m^2_{21} effects in the case of the LMA MSW
solution of the solar problem, showing that they are small for L >= 7000 km.
For shorter baselines, Delta m^2_{21} effects can be relevant and their
dependence on L offers a further handle for the determination of the
CP-violation phase \delta. Finally we comment on the possibility to measure the
specific distortion of the energy spectrum due to the MSW effect.

contribute to the self-energies of the gauge bosons. The relation of this

Since the pattern of the low-energy constants is very different in these two

necessary ingredient of the scenario with localized gravity is the relation
between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension. In the absence of

deal with this issue we introduce a four-form gauge field. This gives an
additional arbitrary contribution to the bulk cosmological constant. As a
result, the model gives rise to a continuous family of brane Universe solutions

Weyl tensor, denoted by $E_{\mu\nu}$, gives the leading order correction to the
conventional Einstein equations on the brane. We consider the general solution
of the perturbation equations for the 5-dimensional Weyl tensor caused by the
matter fluctuations on the brane. By analyzing its asymptotic behaviour in the
direction of the 5th dimension, we find the curvature invariant diverges as we
approach the Cauchy horizon. However, in the limit of asymptotic future in the
vicinity of the Cauchy horizon, the curvature invariant falls off fast enough
to render the divergence harmless to the brane-world. We also obtain the
asymptotic behavior of $E_{\mu\nu}$ on the brane at spatial infinity, assuming
the matter perturbation is localized. We find it falls off sufficiently fast
and will not affect the conserved quantities at spatial infinity. This
indicates strongly that the usual conservation law, such as the ADM energy
conservation, holds on the brane as far as asymptotically flat spacetimes are
concerned.

to pion- and photon-induced $\eta$- and $K$-meson production off protons by
including all strong and electromagnetic p-wave multipoles. We identify the
p-wave amplitudes of the next-to-leading order SU(3) chiral meson-baryon
Lagrangian with a coupled channel potential which is iterated to infinite
orders in a separable Lippmann-Schwinger equation. Our approach to $\eta$- and
$K$-photoproduction introduces no additional free parameters. By adjusting a
few finite range parameters and the unknown parameters in the Lagrangian, we
are able to simultaneously describe a very large amount of low-energy data.
These include the total and differential cross sections of the $\pi$-induced
reactions $\pi^- p \to \eta n, K^0 \Lambda, K^0 \Sigma^0, K^+ \Sigma^-$ and
$\pi^+ p \to K^+ \Sigma^+$ as well as those of photoproduction $\gamma p \to
\eta p, K^+\Lambda, K^+ \Sigma^0, K^0 \Sigma^+$. The polarization observables
measured in $\eta$- and $K$-photoproduction are particularly sensitive to
interference terms between the s- and p-wave multipoles. The total cross
section data are remarkably well reproduced in all channels. There remain,
however, some open questions concerning details of angular distributions and
polarization observables.

calculated for classical ($T \gtrsim \hbar \omega_p$, where $\omega_p$ is the
ion plasma frequency) and quantum ($T \ll \hbar \omega_p$) body-centered cubic
(bcc) crystals. The results for the classical crystal are in a very good
agreement with extensive Monte Carlo (MC) calculations at $1.5 \lesssim r/a

calculated for classical and quantum bcc and face-centered cubic crystals, and
anharmonic corrections are discussed. The inelastic part of the HL static
structure factor $S''(k)$, averaged over orientations of wave-vector {\bf k},
is shown to contain pronounced singularities at Bragg diffraction positions.
The type of the singularities is different in classical and quantum cases. The
HL method can serve as a useful tool complementary to MC and other numerical
methods.
