marginally stable to convection. We show that the marginally stable flow has a
constant temperature and rotational velocity on spherical shells, a net flux of
energy from small to large radii, zero net accretion rate, and a radial density
profile proportional to r^{-1/2}, flatter than the r^{-3/2} profile

flow (ADAF), assuming that there is no mass outflow. We include convection
through a mixing length formalism. We seek self-similar solutions in which the
rotational velocity and sound speed scale as R^{-1/2}, where R is the radius,
and consider two limiting prescriptions for the transport of angular momentum
by convection. In one limit, the transport occurs down the angular velocity
gradient, so convection moves angular momentum outward. In the other, the
transport is down the specific angular momentum gradient, so convection moves
angular momentum inward. We also consider general prescriptions which lie in
between the two limits.
  When convection moves angular momentum outward, we recover the usual
self-similar solution for ADAFs in which the mass density scales as rho ~
R^{-3/2}. When convection moves angular momentum inward, the result depends on
the viscosity coefficient alpha. If alpha>alpha_{crit1} ~ 0.05, we once again
find the standard ADAF solution. For alpha<alpha_{crit}, however, we find a
non-accreting solution in which rho ~ R^{-1/2}. We refer to this as a
""convective envelope"" solution or a ""convection-dominated accretion flow"".
  Two-dimensional numerical simulations of ADAFs with values of alpha<0.03 have
been reported by several authors. The simulated ADAFs exhibit convection. By
virtue of their axisymmetry, convection in these simulations moves angular
momentum inward, as we confirm by computing the Reynolds stress. The
simulations give rho ~ R^{-1/2}, in good agreement with the convective envelope
solution. The R^{-1/2} density profile is not a consequence of mass outflow.

have now reversed this picture: (A) Even though the first two known host
galaxies are indeed greatly subluminous, the next eight hosts have absolute
magnitudes typical for a population of field galaxies. A detailed analysis of
the 16 known hosts (ten with red shifts) shows them to be consistent with a
Schechter luminosity function with $R^{*} = -21.8 \pm 1.0$ as expected for

typically 18 times brighter than the faint bursts with red shifts, however the
bright bursts do not have galaxies inside their error boxes to limits deeper
than expected based on the luminosities for the two samples being identical. A
new solution to this dilemma is that a broad burst luminosity function along
with a burst number density varying as the star formation rate will require the
average luminosity of the bright sample ($>$$6 \times 10^{58} ph \cdot s^{-1}$

for which host galaxies with a normal luminosity will not violate the observed

the relative magnetic helicity associated with the large scale field can
escape, accompanied by an equal and opposite small scale contribution from the
field, since the total magnetic helicity in large magnetic Reynolds number
flows is conserved. From the helicity flow, a lower limit on the magnetic
energy deposited in the corona can be estimated. Steady coronal activity and
the dissipation of magnetic energy is therefore a signature of an internal
dynamo. Our theoretical estimate of the power delivered by a mean field dynamo

cases the flaring loops are likely compact (L approx 0.3 R*), and confined to a
rather narrow range of sizes, incompatible with the large (L >= R*) tenuous
loops claimed by previous analyses of flares on AD Leo and other similar stars.
The flaring loops appear to have a larger cross section (beta = r/L approx.
0.3) than customarily assumed (e.g. beta 0.1). All flares show evidence of
significant heating during the decay phase. Although the derived peak pressures
are high (up to P approx. 10^4 dyne/cm^2) with a peak temperature of approx. 50
MK, the magnetic fields required to confine such loops and to produce the
observed flare luminosity are relatively modest (B approx. 1 to 2 kG) and fully

the ring or transient density enhancements due to the interaction of the
ionization front with previous density fluctuations in the ISM. The lobes show
a pronounced point-symmetric morphology and two peculiar low-ionization

with a close binary nucleus which shows a collimated string of knots embedded
in a diffuse, elliptical shell. The knots expand with a velocity similar to
that of the elliptical nebula (25 km/s), except for an extended tail located
out of the main nebula, which linearly accelerates up to 45 km/s. We estimate
an inclination on the line of the sight of 40 degres for the string of knots;
once the orientation of the orbit is also determined, this information will
allow us to test the prediction of current theories of the occurrence of polar
jets from close binary systems. Wray 17-1 has a complex morphology, showing two
pairs of low-ionization structures located in almost perpendicular directions
from the central star, and embedded in a large, diffuse nebula. The two pairs
show notable similarities and differences, and their origin is very puzzling.

given mass distribution is usually softened, to diminish the effect of
graininess. In this paper we study the effect of such a smoothing, with the aim
of finding an optimal value of the softening parameter. As already shown by
Merritt (1996), for too small a softening the estimates of the forces will be
too noisy, while for too large a softening the force estimates are
systematically misrepresented. In between there is an optimal softening, for
which the forces in the configuration approach best the true forces. The value
of this optimal softening depends both on the mass distribution and on the
number of particles used to represent it. For higher number of particles the
optimal softening is smaller. More concentrated mass distributions necessitate
smaller softening, but the softened forces are never as good an approximation
of the true forces as for not centrally concentrated configurations. We give
good estimates of the optimal softening for homogeneous spheres, Plummer
spheres, and Dehnen spheres. We also give a rough estimate of this quantity for
other mass distributions, based on the harmonic mean distance to the $k$th
neighbour ($k$ = 1, .., 12), the mean being taken over all particles in the
configuration. Comparing homogeneous Ferrers ellipsoids of different shapes we
show that the axial ratios do not influence the value of the optimal softening.
Finally we compare two different types of softening, a spline softening
(Hernquist & Katz 1989) and a generalisation of the standard Plummer softening
to higher values of the exponent. We find that the spline softening fares
roughly as well as the higher powers of the power-law softening and both give a
better representation of the forces than the standard Plummer softening.

Central to our analysis is a new $Z_2$ gauge theory formulation, which supports
topological vortex excitations - dubbed visons. The visons are gapped in the
underdoped phase, splitting the electron's charge and Fermi statistics into two
separate excitations. Superconductivity occurs when the resulting charge $e$

confining the charge and statistics of the electron leading to a Fermi liquid
phase. Right at the quantum confinement transition the visons are in a critical

the following properties with ordinary (periodic) Luttinger liquids: absence of
fermionic quasi-particle excitations, charge-spin separation, anomalous
power-law correlations with exponents whose scaling relations are parametrized
by a single coupling constant per degree of freedom, $K_{\nu}$. The values of
$K_{\nu}$ are independent of boundary conditions, but the representation of the
critical exponents in terms of these $K_{\nu}$ depends on boundary conditions.
We illustrate these scaling relations by exploring general rules for boundary
critical exponents derived earlier using the Bethe Ansatz solution of the 1D
Hubbard model together with boundary conformal field theory, and the theory of
Luttinger liquids in finite-size systems. We apply this theory to the
photoemission properties of the organic conductors $(TMTSF)_2X$, and discuss to
what extent the assumption of finite strands with open boundaries at the sample
surface can reconcile the experimental results with independent information on

respectively to T minus 7 degrees is measured as function of the initial
temperature T. We observe a reversed heat shock at low T. The magnitude of the
shock increases when one increase the distance to the temperature $T_0 \approx
23^o$, thereby mimicking the non monotous stability of proteins at low
temperature. Further we found that the variation of the heat shock with T
quantitatively follows the thermodynamic stability of proteins with

protein folding. We demonstrate that such an implementation is possible in a

via the Born-Oppenheimer reduction, which properly yields the (time-time
component of the) covariantly conserved energy-momentum tensor of the scalar
field as the source term for gravity. However, for a generic coupling, the
expectation value of the operator which evolves the matter state in time is not
equal to the source term in the semiclassical Einstein equation for the scale
factor of the universe and the difference between these two quantities is
related to the squeezing and quantum fluctuations of the matter state. We also
argue that matter quantum fluctuations become relevant in an intermediate

(P-odd)/time-reversal-invariance-odd (T-odd) interactions, and for P-even/T-odd
interactions (assuming CPT conservation this implies C-conjugation
non-conservation). Limits on a P-odd/T-odd interaction follow from measurements
of the electric dipole moment of the neutron (with a present upper limit of 6 x
10^-26 e.cm [95% C.L.]). It provides a limit on a P-odd/T-odd pion-nucleon
coupling constant which is less than 10^-4 times the weak interaction strength.
Experimental limits on a P-even/T-odd interaction are much less stringent.
Following the standard approach of describing the nucleon-nucleon interaction
in terms of meson exchanges, it can be shown that only charged rho-meson
exchange and A_1 meson exchange can lead to a P-even/T-odd interaction. The
better constraints stem from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the
neutron and from measurements of charge-symmetry breaking in neutron-proton
elastic scattering. The latter experiments were executed at TRIUMF (497 and 347

the ``bulk'' of large extra spacetime dimensions. First, we find that the mass
of the axion can become independent of the energy scale associated with the
breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry. This implies that the mass of the axion
can be adjusted independently of its couplings to ordinary matter, thereby
providing a new method of rendering the axion invisible. Second, we discuss the
new phenomenon of laboratory axion oscillations (analogous to neutrino
oscillations), and show that these oscillations cause laboratory axions to
``decohere'' extremely rapidly as a result of Kaluza-Klein mixing. This
decoherence may also be a contributing factor to axion invisibility. Third, we
discuss the role of Kaluza-Klein axions in axion-mediated processes and decays,
and propose several experimental tests of the higher-dimensional nature of the
axion. Finally, we show that under certain circumstances, the presence of an
infinite tower of Kaluza-Klein axion modes can significantly accelerate the
dissipation of the energy associated with cosmological relic axion
oscillations, thereby enabling the Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking scale to
exceed the usual four-dimensional relic oscillation bounds. Together, these
ideas therefore provide new ways of obtaining an ``invisible'' axion within the
context of higher-dimensional theories with large-radius compactifications.

positive mutation and identify some of the basic structures relating the two.
  The fundamental result in understanding knot concordance is the structure
theorem proved by Levine: for n>1 there is an isomorphism phi from the
concordance group C_n of knotted (2n-1)-spheres in S^{2n+1} to an algebraically
defined group G_{+-}; furthermore, G__{+-} is isomorphic to the infinite direct
sum Z^infty direct sum Z_2^infty direct sum Z_4^infty. It was a startling
consequence of the work of Casson and Gordon that in the classical case the
kernel of phi on C_1 is infinitely generated. Beyond this, little has been
discovered about the pair (C_1,phi).
  In this paper we present a new approach to studying C_1 by introducing a
group, M, defined as the quotient of the set of knots by the equivalence
relation generated by concordance and positive mutation, with group operation
induced by connected sum. We prove there is a factorization of phi,
C_1-->M-->G_-. Our main result is that both maps have infinitely generated
kernels.
  Among geometric constructions on classical knots, the most subtle is positive
mutation. Positive mutants are indistinguishable using classical abelian knot
invariants as well as by such modern invariants as the Jones, Homfly or
Kauffman polynomials. Distinguishing positive mutants up to concordance is a
far more difficult problem; only one example has been known until now. The
results in this paper provide, among other results, the first infinite families
of knots that are distinct from their positive mutants, even up to concordance.

defined by the existence of a bimodule with certain additional structures,
implies the equivalence of the categories of strongly non-degenerate

finite rank operators on pre-Hilbert spaces and matrix algebras over
