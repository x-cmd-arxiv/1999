reionization occurred before redshifts of about 5. Previous works on
reionization by the first stars or quasars have shown that such scenarios are
described by a large number of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. Here,
we adopt a semi-analytic model of stellar reionization in order to quantify how
the optical depth to reionization depends on such parameters, and combine this
with constraints from the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find this
approach to be particularly useful in alleviating the well-known degeneracy in
CMB parameter extraction between the optical depth to reionization and the
amplitude of the primordial power spectrum, due to the complementary
information from the reionization model. We also examine translating
independent limits on astrophysical parameters into those on cosmological
parameters, or conversely, how improved determinations of cosmological
parameters will constrain astrophysical unknowns.

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System (LOTIS)
has been conducting a fully automated search for this kind of simultaneous low
energy emission from GRBs since October 1996. Although LOTIS has obtained
simultaneous, or near simultaneous, coverage of the error boxes obtained with

upper limits. The unique gamma-ray properties of GRB 990123, such as very large
fluence (top 0.4%) and hard spectrum, complicate comparisons with more typical
bursts. We scale and compare gamma-ray properties, and in some cases afterglow
properties, from the best LOTIS events to those of GRB 990123 in an attempt to
determine whether the prompt optical emission of this event is representative
of all GRBs. Furthermore, using LOTIS upper limits in conjunction with the

rigorous examination is underway to characterize systematic effects that might
alter the Type Ia supernova results suggesting an accelerating Universe. The
discovery of the central point of X-ray emission in Cas A by CXO should give
new insight into the core collapse problem in general and the nature of the
still undetected compact remnant in SN 1987A in particular. Jets were described
from protostars to microquasars to blazars to gamma-ray bursts. Polarization
studies of core-collapse supernovae lead to the conclusion that core collapse
is not merely asymmetric, but strongly bi-polar. To account for normal
core-collapse supernovae, the explosion must be jet-like in routine
circumstances, that is, in the formation of neutron stars, not only for black
holes. Given the observed asymmetries, estimates of explosion energies based on
spherically-symmetric models must be regarded with caution. The strong
possibility that at least some gamma-ray bursts arise from massive stars means
that it is no longer possible to decouple models of the gamma-ray burst and
afterglow from considerations of the ""machine."" The implied correlation of
gamma-ray bursts with star formation and massive stars and evidence for jets
does not distinguish a black hole collapsar model from models based on the
birth of a magnetar. Calorimetry of at least one afterglow suggests that
gamma-ray bursts cannot involve highly inefficient internal shock models.
Essentally all gamma-ray burst models involve the ""Blandford Anxiety,"" the
origin of nearly equipartition magnetic fields in the associated relativistic
shocks.

supersymmetry as a possible fundamental symmetry of Nature. Is spontaneous
supersymmetry breaking possible ? Where is the spin-1/2 Goldstone fermion of

Can one define conserved baryon and lepton numbers in such theories, although
they systematically involve self-conjugate Majorana fermions ? If we have to
postulate the existence of new bosons carrying B and L (the new spin-0 squarks
and sleptons), can we prevent them from mediating new unwanted interactions ?
  We then recall how we obtained the three basic ingredients of the
Supersymmetric Standard Model: 1) the SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) gauge superfields;
2) the chiral quark and lepton superfields; 3) the two doublet Higgs
superfields responsible for the electroweak breaking, and the generation of
quark and lepton masses. The original continuous ``R-invariance'' of this model
was soon abandoned in favor of its discrete version, R-parity, so that the
gravitino, and gluinos, can acquire masses - gluinos getting their masses from
supergravity, or radiative corrections.
  R-parity forbids unwanted squark and slepton exchanges, and guarantees the
stability of the ``lightest supersymmetric particle''. It is present only since
we restricted the initial superpotential to be an even function of quark and
lepton superfields (so as to allow for B and L conservation laws), as made
apparent by the formula re-expressing R-parity as (-1)^2S (-1)^(3B+L). Whether
it turns out to be absolutely conserved, or not, R-parity plays an essential
role in the phenomenology of supersymmetric theories, and the experimental
searches for the new sparticles.

invertible operator s acting on the Banach space of trace functionals of the
fixed point algebra is canonically associated. KMS states correspond to
positive eigenvectors of s. A Perron-Frobenius type theorem asserts the
existence of KMS states at inverse temperatures equal the logarithms of the
inner and outer spectral radii of s (extremal KMS states). Examples arising
from subshifts in symbolic dynamics, self-similar sets in fractal geometry and
noncommutative metric spaces are discussed.
  Certain subshifts are naturally associated to the system and the relationship
between their topological entropy and inverse temperatures of extremal KMS
states are given.
  Noncommutative shift maps are considered. It is shown that their entropy is
bounded by the sum of the entropy of the associated subshift and a suitable
entropy computed in the homogeneous subalgebra. Examples are discussed among
Matsumoto algebras associated to certain non finite type subshifts.
  The CNT entropy is compared to the classical measure-theoretic entropy of the
subshift. A noncommutative analogue of the classical variational principle for
the entropy of subshifts is obtained for the noncommutative shift of certain
Matsumoto algebras. More generally, a necessary condition is discussed. In the
case of Cuntz-Krieger algebras an explicit construction of the state with
maximal entropy from the unique KMS state is done.

and Walker, is defined in terms a group-completion of the space of algebraic
morphisms from X into BU. It has been further studied by the authors in a
companion paper. Holomorphic K-theory sits between algebraic K-theory and
topological K-theory in the same way that morphic cohomology sits between
motivic cohomology and ordinary cohomology. Our constructions provide a bridge
between these two worlds. We also realize Chern classes in the case where X is
smooth, and establish a universal relation between the Chern character and the
Chern classes. We use classical constructions with algebraic cycles and
infinite symmetric products of projective spaces. The latter can be seen as the
classifying space for motivic cohomology, and under this perspective our
constructions are essentially motivic.

which is defined in terms of the homotopy type of spaces of holomorphic maps
from the variety to Grassmannians and loop groups. This theory was introduced
by Lawson, Lima-Filho and Michelsohn, and also by Friedlander and Walker, and a
related theory was considered by Karoubi. Using the Chern character studied by
the authors in a companion paper, we give a rational isomorphism between
holomorphic $K$-theory and the ""morphic cohomology"" defined by Lawson and
Friedlander. In doing so, we describe a geometric model for rational morphic
cohomology groups in terms of algebraic maps from the variety to the
""symmetrized loop group"" Loops(U(n)/S_n) where the symmetric group S_n acts on
U(n) via conjugation. This is equivalent to studying algebraic maps to the
quotient of the infinite Grassmannians BU(k) by a similar symmetric group
action. We then prove a conjecture of Friedlander and Walker stating that if
one localizes holomorphic K-theory by inverting the Bott class, then it is
rationally isomorphic to topological K-theory. Finally we produce explicit
obstructions to periodicity in holomorphic K-theory, and show that these
obstructions vanish for generalized flag manifolds.

and surprising properties. Therefore, when V carries a real or quaternionic
structure, it is natural to ask for the properties of the groups of real or
quaternionic algebraic cycles on P(V). In this paper and its sequel the
homotopy structure of these cycle groups is determined. They bear a direct
relationship to characteristic classes for the classical groups, and functors
in K-theory extend directly to these groups. These groups give rise to
E-infinity-ring spaces, and the maps extending the K-theory functors are ring
maps. The stabilized space of cycles is a product of (Z/2Z)-equivariant
Eilenberg-MacLane spaces indexed by the representations R^{n,n} for n > 0. This
gives a wide generalization of the results in Boyer, Lawson, Lima-Filho, Mann
and Michelsohn on the Segal question. The ring structure on the homotopy groups
of these stabilized spaces is explicitly computed. In the real case it is a
quotient of a polynomial algebra on two generators corresponding to the first
Pontrjagin and first Stiefel-Whitney classes. This yields an interesting total
characteristic class for real bundles. It is a mixture of integral and mod 2
classes and has nice multiplicative properties. The class is shown to be the
(Z/2Z)-equivariant Chern class on Atiyah's KR-theory.

that are naturally regarded as the components of two 3-vectors and a

state is entangled; and if it is, whether it is a separable state. Some
progress has been made in the search for analytical expressions for the degree
of separability. We report, in particular, the answer in the case of vanishing
3-vectors.
