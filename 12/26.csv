to dispersionless phonons was solved numerically for a ring of 8 atoms using
the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method. It was found that
electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling compete against each other,
and strong electron correlations suppress the charge-ordered insulating state.
This allows extended polarons to form in the strong electron-phonon coupling
regime. It is shown that in this regime two polarons may form a pair via phonon
mediated charge-fluctuation interaction. Based on the results we propose a
novel mechanism of hole pairing. This mechanism could be relevant to High-Tc
cuprates.

expected to undergo a phase transition from the confined phase to the
quark-gluon plasma phase. In the Lagrangian lattice formulation the Monte Carlo
method works well for QCD at finite temperature, however, it breaks down at
finite chemical potential. We develop a Hamiltonian approach to lattice QCD at
finite chemical potential and solve it in the case of free quarks and in the
strong coupling limit. At zero temperature, we calculate the vacuum energy,
chiral condensate, quark number density and its susceptibility, as well as mass
of the pseudoscalar, vector mesons and nucleon. We find that the chiral phase
transition is of first order, and the critical chemical potential is $\mu_C
=m_{dyn}^{(0)}$ (dynamical quark mass at $\mu=0$). This is consistent with
$\mu_C \approx M_N^{(0)}/3$ (where $M_N^{(0)}$ is the nucleon mass at $\mu=0$).

"hep-ph/9912508","Kevin E. Cahill","Kevin Cahill","B-L Neutrinos","13 pages, 2 figures; CP phase fixed; new figure",,,,"hep-ph",,"  Neutrino masses and mixings are analyzed in terms of left-handed fields and a
6x6 complex symmetric mass matrix whose singular values are the neutrino
masses. An angle theta_nu characterizes the kind of the neutrinos, with
theta_nu=0 for Dirac neutrinos and theta_nu=pi/2 for Majorana neutrinos. At
theta_nu = 0 baryon-minus-lepton number is conserved. If theta_nu is
approximately zero, the six neutrino masses coalesce into three nearly
degenerate pairs. Thus the tiny mass differences exhibited in the solar and
atmospheric neutrino experiments are naturally explained by the approximate
conservation of B-L. Neutrinos are nearly Dirac fermions.
  This B-L model leads to these predictions: neutrinos oscillate mainly between
flavor eigenfields and sterile eigenfields, and so the appearance of neutrinos
and antineutrinos is suppressed; neutrinos may well be of cosmological
importance; in principle the disappearance of the tau neutrino should be
observable; and neutrinoless double-beta decay is suppressed by an extra factor
of 10^(-5) and so will not be seen in the Heidelberg/Moscow, IGEX, GENIUS, or
CUORE experiments.

at point X. We calculate P_{X}(T) for wave packets traveling through a
