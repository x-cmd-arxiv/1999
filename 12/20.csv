diffuse background measurements from the OSSE and EGRET instruments on the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory to constrain the luminosity law for gamma-ray
pulsars and some properties of the gamma-ray pulsar population. We find that
the dependence of luminosity on spin period and dipole magnetic field is much
steeper at OSSE than at EGRET energies (50-200 keV and >100 MeV, respectively),
suggesting that different emission mechanisms are responsible for low- and
high-energy gamma-ray emission. Incorporating a spin-down model and assuming a
pulsar spatial distribution, we estimate the fraction of the Galactic gamma-ray
background due to unidentified pulsars and find that pulsars may be an
important component of the OSSE diffuse flux, but are most likely not important
at EGRET energies. Using measurements of the diffuse background flux from these
instruments, we are able to place constraints on the braking index, initial
spin period, and magnetic field of the Galactic pulsar population. We are also
able to constrain the pulsar birthrate to be between 1/(25 yr) and 1/(500 yr).
Our results are based on a large gamma-ray beam, but they do not scale in a
simple way with beam size. With our assumed beam size, the implied gamma-ray
efficiency for the EGRET detections is no more than 20%. We estimate that about
20 of the 169 unidentified EGRET sources are probably gamma-ray pulsars. We use
our model to predict the pulsar population that will be seen by future
gamma-ray instruments and estimate that GLAST will detect roughly 750 gamma-ray
pulsars as steady sources, only 120 of which are currently known radio pulsars.

the fact that this pulsar is most likely subject to interstellar scintillations

confirmed objects in this class define a dynamically cold system, with a global
minimum for the velocity dispersion of only 70 km/s, found in the Local Group
Standard of Rest, while in-falling at 100 km/s toward the LG barycenter. These
objects have a characteristic morphology, in which several compact cores are
embedded in a diffuse halo. The compact cores typically account for 40% of the
HI line flux while covering some 15% of the source area. The cores are the cool
condensed phase of HI, the CNM, with temp. near 100 K, while the halos appear
to be a shielding column of warm diffuse HI, the WNM, with temp. near 8000 K.
We detect a core with one of the narrowest HI emission lines ever observed,
with intrinsic FWHM of 2 km/s and 75 K brightness. From a comparison of column
and volume densities we derive a distance in the range 0.5 to 1 Mpc. We
determine a metallicity for this same object of 0.04 to 0.07 solar. Comparably
high distances are implied by demanding the stability of objects with multiple
cores, which show relative velocities as large as 70 km/s on 30 arcmin scales.
Many compact cores show systematic velocity gradients along the major axis of
their elliptical extent which are consistent with circular rotation. Several of
the derived rotation curves are well-fit by Navarro, Frenk, and White (1997)
cold dark matter profiles. These kinematic signatures imply a high
dark-to-visible mass ratio of 10-50, for D=0.7Mpc, which scales as 1/D. The
implied dark matter halos dominate the mass volume density within the central 2
kpc (10 arcmin) of each source, providing a sufficent hydrostatic pressure to
allow local CNM condensation. (abridged)

in a broad range of radii: one is radiatively cooled and the other one is
advection-dominated. With further increase of accretion rate the radial
extensions of the two solutions shrink and no solutions are found above certain
critical value. However, these trends change if the local parameterization of
advection is replaced by proper radial derivatives computed iteratively from

change the lattice structure of the model. This allows us to study the
influence of frustration on the Mott transition. We find that frustration
increases $U_c$, compared to bipartite systems. The results were obtained from
fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculations using trial functions which allow

the vortex core energy. Their mean distance has a maximum depending on the
vortex core energy and system size, which gives a fractal dimension of $1.27

behavior of $\chi$ is closely related to the large-$r$ behavior of $G(\bf{r})$.
Explicit results are derived for $d>2$. Finite-size scaling must be formulated
in terms of the anisotropic exponential correlation length $\xi_1$ that governs
the decay of $G(\bf{r})$ for large $r$ rather than in terms of the isotropic
correlation length $\xi$ defined via the second moment of $G(\bf{r})$. This
result modifies a recent interpretation concerning an apparent violation of
finite-size scaling in terms of $\xi \neq \xi_1$. Exact results for the $d=1$
Ising model illustrate our conclusions. Furthermore, we show that the
exponential finite-size behavior for $L/\xi\gg 1$ is not captured by the
standard perturbation approach that separates the lowest mode from the higher
modes. Consequences for the theory of finite-size effects for $d>4$ are
discussed. The two-variable finite-size scaling form predicts an approach

6x6 complex symmetric mass matrix whose singular values are the neutrino
masses. An angle x_nu characterizes the kind of the neutrinos, with x_nu = 0
for Dirac neutrinos and x_nu = pi/2 for Majorana neutrinos. If x_nu = 0, then
baryon-minus-lepton number is conserved. When x_nu is approximately zero, the
six neutrino masses coalesce into three nearly degenerate pairs. Thus the
smallness of the differences in neutrino masses exhibited in the solar and
atmospheric neutrino experiments and the stringent limits on neutrinoless
double beta decay are naturally explained if B-L is approximately conserved and
neutrinos are nearly Dirac fermions. If one sets sin(x_nu) = 0.003, suppresses
inter-generational mixing, and imposes a quark-like mass hierarchy, then one
may fit the essential features of the solar, reactor, and atmospheric neutrino
experiments with otherwise random mass matrices in the eV range.
  This B-L model leads to these predictions: neutrinos oscillate mainly between
flavor eigenfields and sterile eigenfields, and so the probabilities of the
appearance of neutrinos or antineutrinos are very small; neutrinos may well be
of cosmological importance; in principle the disappearance of the tau neutrino
should be observable; and neutrinoless double beta decay is suppressed by an
extra factor of < 10^(-5) and hence will not be seen in the Heidelberg/Moscow,
IGEX, GENIUS, or CUORE experiments.

processes where the domain walls decay by the formation of closed string loop

spherical may `pop', so that a hole corresponding to a string boundary

for such processes. We show that after puncture, the hole grows exponentially
at the same rate that the wall expands. It follows that the wall is never
completely thermalized by a single expanding hole; at arbitrarily late times
there is still a large, thin shell of matter which may drive an exponential
expansion of the universe. We also study the situation where the wall is
subjected to multiple punctures. We find that in order to completely annihilate
the wall by this process, at least four string loops must be nucleated. We
argue that this process may be relevant in certain brane-world scenarios, where
the universe itself is a domain wall.

encompassed by Quillen's homotopical algebra. The goal of this paper is to show
that more general forms of homological algebra also fit into Quillen's
framework. Specifically, any set of objects in a complete and cocomplete
abelian category A generates a projective class on A, which is exactly the
information needed to do homological algebra in A. The main result is that if
the generating objects are ``small'' in an appropriate sense, then the category
of chain complexes of objects of A has a model category structure which
reflects the homological algebra of the projective class. The motivation for
this work is the construction of the ``pure derived category'' of a ring R.

exact short and long-time behavior of the autocorrelators. The short-time
behavior is characterized by two parameters which are expressable through the
plasma static correlation functions. The long-time behavior is determined by
the self-diffusion coefficient. The theoretical predictions are compared with
the results of semiclassical molecular dynamics simulation.

emboding Lorentz transformation (LT) show that the relativistic energy-momentum
relationship, implicitly the relativistic mass and energy, do not depend on the
square root appearing in LT, being associated to the absolute motion of a
particle and related to its inner structure. Results concerning the concept of
operational theory and its application to the electromagnetic and gravitational
field theories, as well as to the quantum mechanics are given in appendixes.

each molecular vibrational band. Modification of the indices is associated to
the appearance of ``band degeneracies'', and exchange of rotational states
between two consecutive bands. The topological dynamical origin of these
indices is proven through a semi-classical approach, and their values are
computed in two examples. The relation with the integer quantum Hall effect is
briefly discussed.
