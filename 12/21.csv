abundance arguments, for faint stars or white dwarves to comprise such a large
fraction of the halo mass. This leads to the consideration of more exotic lens
candidates, such as primordial black holes, or alternative lens locations. If
the lenses are located in the halo of the Milky Way, then constraining their
mass function will shed light on their nature. Using the current microlensing
data we find, for four halo models, the best fit parameters for delta-function,
primordial black hole and various power law mass functions. The best fit
primordial black hole mass functions, despite having significant finite width,
have likelihoods which are similar to, and for one particular halo model
greater than, those of the best fit delta functions . We then use Monte Carlo
simulations to investigate the number of microlensing events necessary to
determine whether the MACHO mass function has significant finite width. If the
correct halo model is known, then $\sim$ 500 microlensing events will be
sufficient, and will also allow determination of the mass function parameters
to $\sim 5%$.

(Z=0) stars with particular attention to the AGB phase. At variance with
previous claims we find that these stars experience thermal instability (the so
called thermal pulses). The critical quantity which controls the onset of a
thermally pulsing phase is the amount of CNO in the envelope during the AGB.
For these stars the central He burning starts in the blue side of the HR
diagram and the 1^{st} dredge up does not take place. Then the envelope
maintains its initial composition up to the beginning of the AGB phase.
However, during the early AGB the 2^{nd} dredge-up occurs and fresh He and CNO
elements are engulfed in the convective envelope. We find that in stars with
M.ge.6Mo the resulting amount of ^{12}C is large enough to sustain a normal CNO
burning within the H shell and consequently the star enters the usual thermal
pulse phase. In the 5Mo model, owing to the lower ^{12}C enhancement in the
envelope after the 2^{nd} dredge-up, the He burning shell suffers weak thermal
instabilities. 9 of these thermal oscillation are needed before the He burning
luminosity reaches 3x10^5 Lo and a first convective shell develops in between
the two burning shells. Later on a second convective shell forms at the base of
the H rich envelope. This convective zone cross the H/He discontinuity and
partially overlaps the previous one, dredging up fresh ^{12}C. After a huge H
flash, a quiescent CNO burning settle on.
  From this moment a thermal pulse phase starts, which is very similar to the
one experienced by the more massive models.

that blue HB stars may be present in the outer regions, and measure the

20.70+/-0.12, based on the RGB tip luminosity, which is in good agreement with
that obtained from the mean magnitude of old HB stars [(m-M)o=20.76+/-0.04] and
with previous results. The (B-I) distribution of the RG stars can be
approximately described as the superposition of two populations. The dominant
component, comprising ~70% of the red giant stars, consists of relatively
metal-enriched intermediate-age stars, whose mean metallicity is
[Fe/H]=-1.39+/-0.15 (the age-corrected metallicity would be [Fe/H] ~
-1.0+/-0.15). The dominant intermediate-age component has an intrinsic color
dispersion \sigma(B-I)=0.06+/-0.01mag, corresponding to a relatively low
abundance dispersion, \sigma[Fe/H]=0.12+/-0.02dex. In addition, there is a
small population of giants on the blue side of the RGB, whose spatial
distribution is consistent with that of old horizontal branch stars, and
completely different from that of the younger population. This unambiguously
qualifies them as old and metal-poor. The exceptional color width of the Fornax
RGB is therefore due to the presence of two main populations, yielding a large
abundance range (-2.0<[Fe/H]<-0.7). This evidence suggests a scenario in which
this galaxy started forming a stellar halo and its surrounding clusters

that medium. In order for this mechanism to work there must be continuous
tangling of the magnetic field, changing the magnetic equation of state away
from pure flux freezing (otherwise conversion of Poynting flux to kinetic
energy flux is suppressed). This is a complementary approach to models in which
the plasma is accelerated by large scale ordered fields. We include a simple
prescription for magnetic dissipation, which leads to tradeoffs among
conversion of magnetic energy into bulk kinetic energy, random particle energy,
and radiation. We present analytic dynamical solutions of such jets, assess the
effects of radiation drag, and comment on observational issues, such as the
predicted polarization and synchrotron brightness. Finally, we try to make the

wing on the CO profile in the day 95 spectrum could indicate a large CO
expansion velocity (~2000 -- 3000 km/s). This is the third detection of
infrared CO emission in nearly as many Type II supernovae studied, implying
that molecule formation may be fairly common in Type II events, and that the
early formation of molecules in SN 1987A may be typical rather than
exceptional. Multi-peak hydrogen and helium lines suggest that SN 1998S is
interacting with a circumstellar disk, and the fading of the red side of this
profile with time is suggestive of dust formation in the ejecta, perhaps
induced by CO cooling. Continuum emission that rises towards longer wavelengths
(J -> K) is seen after day 225 with an estimated near-infrared luminosity >~
10^40 erg/s. This may be related to the near-infrared excesses seen in a number
of other supernovae. If this continuum is due to free-free emission, it
requires an exceptionally shallow density profile. On the other hand, the shape
of the continuum is well fit by a 1200 +- 150 K blackbody spectrum possibly due
to thermal emission from dust. Interestingly, we observe a similar 1200 K
blackbody-like, near-infrared continuum in SN 1997ab, another Type IIn

differences between the spectroscopic and CORAVEL-type measurements as large as
1-3 km/s in certain phases. We performed Baade-Wesselink analysis for CK Cam

is in very good agreement with recent period-radius relation by Gieren et al.
(1999). Observational pieces of evidence of possible velocity gradient
affecting the individual line profiles are studied. The FWHM of the metallic
lines, similarly to the velocity differences, shows a very characteristic phase
dependence, illustrating the effect of global compression in the atmosphere.
The smallest line widths always occur around the maximal radius, while the
largest FWHM is associated with the velocity reversal before the minimal
radius. Three first overtone pulsators do not follow the general trend: the
largest FWHM in SU Cas and SZ Tau occurs after the smallest radius, during the
expansion, while in V1334 Cyg there are only barely visible FWHM-variations.
The possibility of a bright yellow companion of V1334 Cyg is briefly discussed.
The observed line profile asymmetries can be partly associated with the
velocity gradient, which is also supported by the differences between

diverges}, due to the formation of locked charge density waves. At temperature
well above a cross-over temperature $T^*$ the trans-resistivity follows a power
law $\rho \propto T^x$, where the interaction-strength dependent exponent $x$
is determined by the Luttinger Liquid parameter $K_{c-}$ of the relative charge

solitonic excitations, reflected by an exponential temperature dependence. The
cross-over temperature $T^*$ depends sensitively on the wire width, inter-wire

$\bar{d} \gg k_F^{-1}$ it is exponentially suppressed with $T/E_F \sim \exp[ -

among the agents, seems indispensable for scaling up multi-agent systems

adaptive agents is choosing their action spaces to be as amenable as possible
to machine learning techniques, especially to reinforcement learning (RL)
techniques. One important way to have the interaction structure connecting
agents itself be adaptive is to have the intentions and/or actions of the
agents be in the input spaces of the other agents, much as in Stackelberg
games. We consider both kinds of adaptivity in the design of a MAS to control
network packet routing.
  We demonstrate on the OPNET event-driven network simulator the perhaps
surprising fact that simply changing the action space of the agents to be
better suited to RL can result in very large improvements in their potential
performance: at their best settings, our learning-amenable router agents
achieve throughputs up to three and one half times better than that of the
standard Bellman-Ford routing algorithm, even when the Bellman-Ford protocol
traffic is maintained. We then demonstrate that much of that potential

network sends all of its traffic down the path that will incur the lowest cost
to that traffic. In the limit of an infinitesimally small amount of traffic for
a particular router, its routing that traffic via an ISPA is optimal, as far as
cost incurred by that traffic is concerned. We demonstrate though that in many
cases, due to the side-effects of one router's actions on another routers
performance, having routers use ISPA's is suboptimal as far as global aggregate
cost is concerned, even when only used to route infinitesimally small amounts
of traffic. As a particular example of this we present an instance of Braess'
paradox for ISPA's, in which adding new links to a network decreases overall
throughput. We also demonstrate that load-balancing, in which the routing
decisions are made to optimize the global cost incurred by all traffic
currently being routed, is suboptimal as far as global cost averaged across
time is concerned. This is also due to ""side-effects"", in this case of current
routing decision on future traffic.
  The theory of COllective INtelligence (COIN) is concerned precisely with the
issue of avoiding such deleterious side-effects. We present key concepts from
that theory and use them to derive an idealized algorithm whose performance is
better than that of the ISPA, even in the infinitesimal limit. We present
experiments verifying this, and also showing that a machine-learning-based
version of this COIN algorithm in which costs are only imprecisely estimated (a

model in the infinite coupling limit; expanding around this ground state we
derive a strong coupling expansion and compute the lowest lying hadron masses

well reproduces the results of the continuum theory. Baryons are massless in

the dominant one-gluon-exchange interaction, both the transition temperature
and zero temperature gap have been determined to leading order in the coupling,
g. While the leading non-BCS behavior, $T_C\sim\mu g^{-5}e^{-\kappa/g}$, is
easily obtained, the pre-exponential factor has proved more difficult to
evaluate. Focusing on the transition temperature, we present a perturbative
derivation of this factor, exact to leading order in g. This approach is first
motivated by the study of a toy model and involves working to second order in
the perturbative expansion. We compare this result to the zero temperature gap.
Additionally, we extend the analysis to the case of higher angular momentum for
longitudinal and transverse quark pairing.

zero-triality representations; for the representations with non-zero triality
the string tension equals that of the fundamental representation. Some rather
``unphysical,'' flux distributions can lead to violations of Casimir scaling at

particle [LSP]. We investigate the limits on the mass of a heavy gluino LSP,
using the searches for excess events in the jets plus missing momentum channel
in Run I. The neutral and charged R-hadrons, containing a heavy gluino LSP,
have distinct signatures at the Fermilab Tevatron. The range of excluded gluino
masses depends on whether the R-hadron is charged or neutral and the amount of
energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter. The latter depends on the energy
loss per collision in the calorimeter and the number of collisions; where both
quantities require a model for R-hadron- Nucleon scattering. We show how the
excluded range of gluino mass depends on these parameters. We find that gluinos
with mass in the range between $\sim 35$ GeV and $\sim 115$ GeV are excluded by
CDF Run I data. Combined with previous results of Baer et al., which use LEP
data to exclude the range 3 - 22$\sim$25 GeV, our result demonstrates that an
allowed window for a heavy gluino with mass between 25 and 35 GeV is quite
robust. Finally we discuss the relevant differences of our analysis of Tevatron

equations. Natural conditions are given for the non-triviality of degenerating
