  (an Anderson impurity system) subject to both constant and alternating
electric fields is studied in the Kondo regime. A systematic diagram technique
is developed for perturbation study of the current in physical systems out of
equilibrium governed by time - dependent Hamiltonians of the Anderson and the
Kondo models. The ensuing calculations prove to be too complicated for the
Anderson model, and hence, a mapping on an effective Kondo problem is called
for. This is achieved by constructing a time - dependent version of the
Schrieffer - Wolff transformation. Perturbation expansion of the current is
then carried out up to third order in the Kondo coupling J yielding a set of
remarkably simple analytical expressions for the current. The zero - bias
anomaly of the direct current differential conductance is shown to be
suppressed by the alternating field while side peaks develop at finite source -
drain voltage. Both the direct component and the first harmonics of the time -
dependent response are equally enhanced due to the Kondo effect, while
amplitudes of higher harmonics are shown to be relatively small. A zero
alternating bias anomaly is found in the alternating current differential
conductance, that is, it peaks around zero alternating bias. This peak is
suppressed by the constant bias. No side peaks show up in the differential
alternating - conductance but their counterpart is found in the derivative of
the alternating current with respect to the direct bias. The results pertaining
to nonlinear response are shown to be valid also below the Kondo temperature.

renormalized field functions and defining the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator
$H_0$ that, under the Lorentz condition, describes the free particles of the
initial and final states in scattering processes, we form an operator
description with which the renormalized Green functions can be expressed as the
vacuum expectations of the time ordered products of the Heisenberg operators of
the renormalized field functions, that satisfy the usual equal time commutation
or anticommutation rules. From such an operator description we find a total
Hamiltonian $\widetilde{H}$ that determine the time evolution of the Heisenberg
operators of the renormalized field functions. The scattering matrix is nothing
but the matrix of the operator $U(\infty, -\infty)$, which describes the time
evolution from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ in the interaction picture specified by
$\widetilde{H}$ and $H_0$, respect to a base formed by the physical eigen
states of $H_0$. We also explain the asymptotic field viewpoint of constructing
the scattering matrix within our operator description. Moreover, we find a
formular to express the scattering matrix elements in terms of the truncated

polynomial bases which are Groebner bases of the special form. The most general
involutive algorithms are based on the concept of involutive monomial division

computational procedure for constructing an involutive basis by performing
non-multiplicative prolongations and multiplicative reductions. Every specific
involutive division generates a particular form of involutive computational
procedure. In addition to three involutive divisions used by Thomas, Janet and
Pommaret for analysis of partial differential equations we define two new ones.
These two divisions, as well as Thomas division, do not depend on the order of
variables. We prove noetherity, continuity and constructivity of the new
divisions that provides correctness and termination of involutive algorithms
for any finite set of input polynomials and any admissible monomial ordering.
We show that, given an admissible monomial ordering, a monic minimal involutive
basis is uniquely defined and thereby can be considered as canonical much like
the reduced Groebner basis.
