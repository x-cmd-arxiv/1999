two samples of planetary nebulae (PNe) by means of millimeter wave observations
of 12CO and 13CO. The first group includes six PNe which have been observed in
the 3He+ hyperfine transition by Balser et al. (1997); the other group consists
of 22 nebulae with rich molecular envelopes. We have determined the carbon
isotopic ratio in 14 objects, 9 of which are new detections. The results
indicate a range of values of 12C/13C between 9 and 23. We estimate the mass of
the progenitors of the PNe of our sample and combine this information with the
derived 12C/13C isotopic ratios to test the predictions of stellar
nucleosynthesis models.
  We find that the majority of PNe have isotopic ratios below the values
expected from current standard asymptotic giant branch models in the mass range
of interest. We suggest that the progenitors of the PNe must have undergone a
non-standard mixing process during their red giant phase and/or asymptotic
giant phase, resulting in a significant enhancement of the 13C abundance in the
surface layers. Our study confirms a similar behaviour inferred from
spectroscopic observations of field population II stars and globular cluster
giants, and extends it to the final stages of stellar evolution. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results on models of Galactic chemical
evolution of 3He and 12C/13C.

dust particles and facilitate the formation of planetesimals and planets. We
introduce an exact vortex solution of the incompressible 2D Euler equation and
study the motion of dust particles in that vortex. In particular, we derive
analytical expressions for the capture time and the mass capture rate as a
function of the friction parameter. Then, we study how small-scale turbulent
fluctuations affect the motion of the particles in the vortex and determine
their rate of escape by solving a problem of quantum mechanics. We apply these
results to the solar nebula and find that the capture is optimum near Jupiter's
orbit (as noticed already by Barge & Sommeria 1995) but also in the Earth
region. This second optimum corresponds to the transition between the Epstein
and the Stokes regime which takes place, for relevant particles, at the
separation between telluric and giant planets (i.e near the asteroid belt). At
these locations, the particles are efficiently captured and concentrated by the
vortices and can undergo gravitational collapse to form the planetesimals.

modestly populated, with specific frequency S_N = 3.7 +- 0.5. We suggest on the

accreted from low-mass satellites, but no single one of the three classic modes

strong challenges to these models remain. The principal anomaly in this GCS is
essentially the complete lack of metal-rich clusters. If these were present in
normal (M87-like) numbers in addition to the metal-poor ones that are already
there, then the GCS in total would more closely resemble what we see in many
other giant E galaxies.

  semiconductor nanostructures"" Ustron-Jaszowiec, Poland, June 12-16, 1999",,,,"cond-mat",,"  Spins of charge carriers, paramagnetic centers, and nuclei in semiconductor
structures are known to be oriented if circular-polarized light is shined upon
the structure. This is due to transfer of angular momentum from photons to
various excitations in the semiconductor. What would happen if the structure is
anisotropic, so that the angular momentum is not conserved? Experiments
performed on diluted-magnetic II-VI quantum wells (such as CdMnTe/CdMgTe) show
that at some conditions the effect of light upon the spin state of the
semiconductor structure can be greatly amplified. Exchange field of
photoexcited heavy holes initiates a coherent evolution of a great number of
localized spins of Mn-ions. In the simplest case, it is just a precession in an
effective field, but generally the spin dynamics is more intricate. It shows
up, for instance, in long sequences of spin-flip peaks in Raman spectra, in
enhanced magnetic-polaron effect, and in modulation of optical response within
the picosecond time scale.

observed that retrieval systems in TREC 6 show some remarkable patterns in

geometric linear model of information retrieval systems. We then apply the
model to predict the number of relevant documents by the retrieval systems. The
model is also scalable to a much larger data set. Although the model is
developed based on the TREC 6 routing test data, I believe it can be readily
applicable to other information retrieval systems. In Appendix, we explained a

for all KS flavors via gauge invariant and non-invariant axial vector currents

as the best value using the partially conserved axial vector current, which
requires no renormalization. From a study for the other KS flavors we find that
the results obtained with the non-perturbative renormalization constants are
well convergent among the KS flavors in the continuum limit, confirming
restoration of $\rm SU(4)_A$ flavor symmetry, while perturbative
renormalization still leaves an apparent flavor breaking effect even in the

result in different presentations of these systems while a ""unitary"" gauge
fixing of the new $ \kappa_+$ symmetry retrieves the original action with
$\kappa_- = \kappa $ symmetry. For D1 brane our extended phase space makes all

field (namely $(0, 1)$ string).

physical entities without there being a physical interaction between the
observer and the physical entity measured. Epstein (1945) and Renninger (1960)
discussed this situation, and Renninger called this type of observation a
""negative observation."" Empirical research on electron shelving supports the
possibility of negative observations (Bergquist, Hulet, Itano, and Wineland,
1986; Nagourney, Sandberg, and Dehmelt, 1986; Sauter, Neuhauser, Blatt, and
Toschek, 1986). Two scenarios are presented that emphasize the role of human
observation in negative observations. The first is modeled after the two hole
gedankenexperiments of Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1965) and portrays
negative observations in a non-technical manner. The second scenario allows for
quantifying the affect on physical entities of negative observations in a
simple fashion. In addition, various issues related to negative observation are
discussed, including an objection that might be raised. The Schrodinger cat
gedankenexperiment is discussed briefly as well.

traveling-wave single-photon wave-packets into atomic states and vise versa
with nearly 100% efficiency. In contrast to previous approaches involving
single atoms, the present technique does not require the strong coupling regime
corresponding to high-Q micro-cavities. Instead, intracavity
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency is used to achieve a strong coupling
between the cavity mode and the atoms.

express the most general two-photon state generated by {\em Inside} creation
operators, through base states generated by {\em Outside} creation operators.
After renormalization of coefficients of inside two-photon state, we calculate
the outside photon-number probability distribution in a general case. Finally
we treat with some detail the single mode and symmetrical cavity case.
