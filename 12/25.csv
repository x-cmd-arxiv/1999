rotating magnetized gas cloud. We found that amplification of a toroidal
magnetic field due to the differential rotation leads to a transformation of
the part of the rotational energy of the cloud to the radial kinetic energy.
Simulations have been made for 3 initial values of $\xi$ (the relation of
magnetic energy to the gravitational energy of the cloud): $\xi
=10^{-2},10^{-4},10^{-6}$. Part of the matter - $\sim 7%$ of the mass of the
cloud ($\sim 3.3%$ of the final gravitational energy of the cloud) - gets
radial kinetic energy which is larger than its potential energy and can be
thrown away to the infinity. It carries about 30% of the initial angular
momentum of the cloud. This effect is important for angular momentum loss in
the processes of stellar formation, and for the magnetorotational mechanism of
explosion suggested for supernovae. Simulations have been made on the basis of
the Lagrangian 2D numerical implicit scheme on a triangular grid with grid

interesting aspect is the reaction of the inner magnetosphere to an induced

all carried by the particles created in the gap. However, if external
current-carrying particles are added, the gap moves inward or outward; it can
even appear near the star. It is suggested that the gaps appear at various

abundance Z in the core region of clusters of galaxies. First, we confirm that
fundamental relations among rho_0, R, and T found by Fujita and Takahara are
reproduced by another data catalogue. Second, we find that, when clusters have
two components in their surface brightness distribution, the inner components
also satisfy the same fundamental relations on the assumption that the average
temperature of the inner component is the same as that of the outer component.
These results strengthen our interpretation that clusters form a two parameter
family in terms of mass and rho_vir; larger rho_vir corresponds to earlier
formation epoch. We argue that the inner components represent distinct dark
matter components which collapsed ahead of the outer components. Third, we also
find a tight relation between S_gas and rho_vir both for the outer and inner
components; S_gas is smaller for larger rho_vir but is larger than that
produced through gravitational collapse alone for larger rho_vir. Although
radiative cooling affects the thermal evolution, the tight relationship
discovered suggests the existence of stable heating sources or stable energy
transmission mechanisms. Finally, we find that the iron abundance at the
centers of clusters is correlated with rho_vir for the inner components. This
implies that iron produced by Type Ia supernovae has more accumulated for
clusters formed earlier. We briefly discuss the implications of these findings.

rotating background. It is shown that in the Kerr background without horizon
but with an inner boundary a scalar field has complex-frequency modes and that,
however, the imaginary part of the complex frequency can be small enough
compared with the Hawking temperature if the inner boundary is sufficiently
close to the horizon, say at a proper altitude of Planck scale. Hence, the
brick wall model is well defined even in a rotating background if the inner
boundary is sufficiently close to the horizon. These results strongly suggest
that the entanglement approach is also well defined in a rotating background.

Einsteinian cosmological constant, is about 120 orders of magnitude smaller
than the theoretically predicted value. Motivated by this problem, a number of
models of dynamically decaying dark energy have been proposed by considering
different phenomenological laws or potentials of the scalar field, which are
more or less ad-hoc. However, it is more advisable to consider the symmetry
properties of spacetime rather than the ad-hoc assumptions.
  In this view, we consider a model of Robertson-Walker cosmology emerging from
a Ricci symmetry which provides consistently an evolving dark energy. We test
the model for the recent supernovae Ia data, as well as, the ultracompact radio
sources data compiled by Jackson and Dodgson. The model fits the data very
well.
