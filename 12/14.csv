a sun-like star - confirmed that it is a gas giant and determined that its
orbital inclination is 85 degrees. This inclination makes possible
investigations of the planet atmosphere. In this paper we discuss the planet
transmission spectra during a transit. The basic tenet of the method is that
the planet atmosphere absorption features will be superimposed on the stellar
flux as the stellar flux passes through the planet atmosphere above the limb.
The ratio of the planet's transparent atmosphere area to the star area is
small, approximately 10^{-3} to 10^{-4}; for this method to work very strong
planet spectral features are necessary. We use our models of close-in
extrasolar giant planets to estimate promising absorption signatures: the
alkali metal lines, in particular the Na I and K I resonance doublets, and the
He I $2^3S$ - $2^3P$ triplet line at 1083.0 nm. If successful, observations
will constrain the line-of-sight temperature, pressure, and density. The most
important point is that observations will constrain the cloud depth, which in
turn will distinguish between different atmosphere models. We also discuss the
potential of this method for EGPs at different orbital distances and orbiting
non-solar-type stars.

scales.
  Probably the most important recent discovery is the presence of cluster
sub-populations in many (if not all) early-type galaxies. The latter seem to be
closely linked to galaxy formation and evolution, and appear to support
hierarchical clustering models, however with an early spheroid formation.

presented. We first present spectroscopy of individual globular clusters
(feasible with the advent of the 10m-class telescopes), and the measurement of
Balmer line indices. Second, we discuss the photometry of globular cluster
sub-populations and the mean age determination by comparison with population
synthesis models. The first method is time consuming but precise once spectra
with high enough signal to noise are obtained. One caveat, however, is the
definition of the Balmer line indices that often include metal features and are
themselves not independent of metallicity. The second method requires the
measurement of two photometric quantities that depend differently from age and
metallicity. The combination of both allows to break the age-metallicity
degeneracy present in broad-band colors. Near-infrared colors can strongly
complement the optical studies in this respect.
  Overall it is, however, true that the older a star cluster, the harder it is
to determine its precise age. Population synthesis models also need to be
further improved, and the models compared here show significant differences.

clouds (GMCs) centrally illuminated by recently formed stars. The models follow
the evolution of the GMCs due to the ionization-induced expansion of the HII
regions and the evolution of the stellar population within the GMC according to
the Bruzual & Charlot stellar population synthesis models. The effect of
transiently heated dust grains/PAHs to the radiative transfer, as well as
multiple scattering, is taken into account.
  The expansion of the HII regions and the formation of a narrow neutral shell
naturally explains why the emission from PAHs dominates over that from hot dust
in the near to mid-IR, an emerging characteristic of the infrared spectra of
starburst galaxies.
  The models allow us to relate the observed properties of a galaxy to its age
and star formation history. We find that exponentially decaying 10^7-10^8 yrs
old bursts can explain the IRAS colours of starburst galaxies. The models are
also shown to account satisfactorily for the multiwavelength data on the
prototypical starburst galaxy M82 and NGC6090, a starburst galaxy recently
observed by ISO. In M82 we find evidence for two bursts separated by 10^7yrs.
In NGC6090 we find that at least part of the far-IR excess may be due to the
age of the burst (6.4 x 10^7yrs). We also make predictions about the evolution
of the luminosity of starbursts at different wavelengths which indicate that
far-IR surveys may preferentially detect older starbursts than mid-IR surveys.

integration. If the orbit is regular, we approximate it by a truncated Fourier
time series of a few tens of terms per coordinate. Switching to a description
in action-angle variables, this corresponds to a reconstruction of the
underlying invariant torus. We then relate the uniform distribution of a
regular orbit on its torus to the non-uniform distribution in the space of
observables by a simple Jacobian transformation between the two sets of
coordinates. This allows us to compute, in a cell-independent way, all the
physical quantities needed in the study of the orbit, including the density and
in the line-of-sight velocity distribution, with much increased accuracy. The
resulting flexibility in the determination of the orbital properties, and the
drastic reduction of storage space for the orbit library, provide a significant
improvement in the practical application of Schwarzschild's orbit superposition
method for constructing galaxy models. We test and apply our method to

the Particle Mesh (PM), the adaptive P3M (AP3M) code, and the Adaptive
Refinement Tree (ART) code. This study can therefore be interesting both as an
analysis of numerical effects and as a systematic comparison of different
codes. We find that the AP3M and the ART codes produce similar results, given
that convergence is reached within the code type. We also find that numerical
effects may affect the high-resolution simulations in ways that have not been
discussed before. In particular, our study revealed the presence of two-body
scattering, effects of which can be greatly amplified by inaccuracies of time
integration. This process appears to affect the correlation function of matter,
mass function and inner density of dark matter halos and other statistics at
scales much larger than the force resolution, although different statistics may
be affected in different fashion. We discuss the conditions at which strong
two-body scattering is possible and discuss the choice of the force resolution
and integration time step. Furthermore, we discuss recent claims that
simulations with force softening smaller than the mean interparticle separation
are not trustworthy and argue that this claim is incorrect in general and
applies only to the phase-sensitive statistics. Our conclusion is that,
depending on the choice of mass and force resolution and integration time step,
a force resolution as small as 0.01 of the mean interparticle separation can be
justified.

black hole is the event horizon. To a distant observer, the event horizon casts
a relatively large ``shadow'' with an apparent diameter of ~10 gravitational
radii due to bending of light by the black hole, nearly independent of the
black hole spin or orientation. The predicted size (~30 micro-arcseconds) of
this shadow for Sgr A* approaches the resolution of current

for 10.3 hr in the UV and 2.8 d in the optical, and simultaneous RXTE and ASCA
monitoring covered the same period. The X-rays were strongly variable with the
soft (0.5-2 keV) showing stronger variations (~65% peak-to-peak) than the hard
(2-10 keV; ~50% peak-to-peak). The optical continuum showed much smaller but
highly significant variations: a slow ~2.5% rise followed by a faster ~3.5%
decline. The short UV observation did not show significant variability.
  The soft and hard X-ray light curves were strongly correlated with no
significant lag. Likewise, the optical continuum bands (3590 and 5510 A) were
also strongly correlated with no measurable lag above limits of <0.15 d.
However no significant correlation or simple relationship could be found for
the optical and X-ray light curves. These results appear difficult to reconcile
with previous reports of correlations between X-ray and optical variations and
of measurable lags within the optical band for some other Seyfert 1s.
  These results also present serious problems for ""reprocessing"" models in
which the X-ray source heats a stratified accretion disk which then reemits in
the optical/ultraviolet: the synchronous variations within the optical would
suggest that the emitting region is <0.3 lt-d across, while the lack of
correlation between X-ray and optical variations would indicate, in the context
of this model, that any reprocessing region must be >1 lt-d in size. It may be
possible to resolve this conflict by invoking anisotropic emission or special
geometry, but the most natural explanation appears to be that the bulk of the
optical luminosity is generated by some other mechanism than reprocessing.

August--November of four Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), characterized by
unusually steep soft X-ray spectra (photon index, \Gamma_{0.2-2.4 keV} \sim
2-2.5), as previously measured with ROSAT. Such steep X-ray slopes are similar
to those observed in synchrotron-dominated BL Lacs and are unexpected in the
context of the recent blazar paradigm, where sources with strong emission lines
(such as FSRQs) are dominated in soft X-rays by a flat inverse Compton tail. We
find that the ASCA spectra of the four FSRQs are consistent with a power law
model with \Gamma_{2-10 keV} \sim 1.8, flatter than their ROSAT spectra. This
indicates the onset of an inverse Compton component at energies \gtrsim 2 keV,
in agreement with the blazar unification scheme. However, these objects are
still anomalous within the blazar class for their steep soft X-ray continua
which, together with non-simultaneous data at longer wavelengths, hint at the
possibility that the synchrotron emission extends to soft X-rays. This would
imply an anomalously high synchotron peak frequency for a quasar with luminous
broad lines, challenging current blazar unification schemes. Alternatively, a
plausible explanation for the steep optical-to-soft X-ray continua of the four
FSRQs is thermal emission from the accretion disk, similar to the blazars
3C~273 and 3C~345. In the Appendix, we present fits to the SIS data in an

Compton scattering events in ambient field of thermal X-ray photons and by
allowing for two models of particle acceleration. In the range between $1\MeV$

of primary particles. Synchrotron component due to secondary pairs becomes
dominant only below $1\MeV$. The slope of the curvature radiation spectrum in
the energy range from $100\MeV$ to $10\GeV$ strongly depends on the model of
longitudinal acceleration, whereas below $\sim 100\MeV$ all slopes converge to
a unique value of 4/3 (in a $\nu {\cal F}_\nu$ convention). The thermal soft
X-ray photons, which come either from the polar cap or from the surface, are
Compton upscattered to a domain of the VHE and form a separate spectral
component peaking at $\sim 1\TeV$. We discuss observability of millisecond

Accepted for publication by ApJ",,"10.1086/308713",,"astro-ph",,"  Abridged] We present here new results on the space density of rich,
optically-selected, clusters of galaxies at low redshift (z<0.15). These
results are based on the application of the matched filter cluster-finding
algorithm to 1067 deg2 of the Edinburgh/Durham Southern Galaxy Catalogue
(EDSGC). This is the first major application of this methodology at low
redshift and in total, we have detected 2109 clusters above a richness cut-off
of R_m >= 50 (or Lambda_cl >= 10). We have used extensive Monte Carlo
simulations to define the detection thresholds for our algorithm, to measure
the effective area of the EDCCII and to determine our spurious detection rate.
These simulations have shown that our detection efficiency is strongly
correlated with the presence of large-scale structure in the EDSGC data which
we believe is due to the assumption of a flat, uniform background. Using these
simulations, we are able to compute the space density of clusters in this new
survey. We find 83.5 10-6 h-3 Mpc-3 for 100<= R_m < 200 (Lambda_cl~20) systems,
10.1 10-6 h-3 Mpc-3 for 200 <= R_m < 400 (Lambda_cl~40) systems and 2.3 10-6
h-3 Mpc-3 for R_m > 400 (Lambda_cl > 80) systems. These three richness bands
roughly correspond to Abell Richness Classes 0, 1 and >=2 respectfully. These

those found at higher redshift (0.2 < z_est < 0.6) in the Palomar Distant
Cluster Survey (PDCS; Postman et al. 1996 & Holden et al. 1999) thus confirming
that the space density of clusters remains nearly constant out to z~0.6 in
agreement with previous optical and X-ray measurements of the space density of
clusters.

for collimated outflows and emission, and strengthened the connection between
GRBs and supernovae. If massive stars are the progenitors of GRBs, the hard
photon pulse will propagate in the pre-burst, dense environment. Circumstellar
material will Compton scatter the prompt GRB radiation and give rise to a
reflection echo. We calculate luminosities, spectra, and light curves of such
Compton echoes in a variety of emission geometries and ambient gas
distributions, and show that the delayed hard X-ray flash from a pulse
propagating into a red supergiant wind could be detectable by Swift out to
z~0.2. Independently of the gamma-ray spectrum of the prompt burst, reflection
echoes will typically show a high-energy cutoff between m_ec^2/2 and m_ec^2
because of Compton downscattering. At fixed burst energy per steradian, the
luminosity of the reflected echo is proportional to the beaming solid angle,
Omega_b, of the prompt pulse, while the number of bright echoes detectable in
the sky above a fixed limiting flux increases as Omega_b^{1/2}, i.e. it is
smaller in the case of more collimated jets. The lack of an X-ray echo at one
month delay from the explosion poses severe constraints on the possible
existence of a lateral GRB jet in SN 1987A. The late r-band afterglow observed
in GRB990123 is fainter than the optical echo expected in a dense red
supergiant environment from a isotropic prompt optical flash. Significant MeV
delayed emission may be produced through the bulk Compton (or Compton drag)
effect resulting from the interaction of the decelerating fireball with the
scattered X-ray radiation.

inter-vertex distance in the sample, thus forming a realization of the
Szalay-Schramm prescription. For the geometry and structural patterns even more
significant is the finding tessellation vertices display a similar linear
increase for their correlation length $r_{\rm a}$, the coherence length at
which $\xi(r_{\rm a})=0$. Such patterns therefore exhibit positive correlations
out to distances considerably in excess of the cellsize. Most intriguing is the
implication of self-similar scaling, while these results may be regarded as the
presentation of a ``geometrical bias'' effect. A seemingly rigid structure

with $\xi\approx 1$ instead of the value $\xi=4/3$ predicted by a na\""{\i}ve
kinetic theory. For short time, we find an effective exponent $\xi\approx 0.7$
consistent with previous simulations and experiments. We show that the mean
square displacement of surviving vortices grows as $<x^2>\sim t^{1+\xi/2}$.
Introducing effective dynamics for two-body and three-body collisions, we
justify that only the latter become relevant at small vortex area coverage. A
kinetic theory consistent with this mechanism leads to $\xi=1$. We find that
the theoretical relations between kinetic parameters are all in good agreement
with experiments.

mode-coupling equations to experimental light-scattering spectra of two fragile

$T_c$, but also the static transition temperature $T_s$ corresponding
supposedly to $T_K$. For the models and systems considered here, $T_s$ is
always found above $T_g$, in the fluid phase. A comparison with recent

evaluated by extending the techniques developed by Gilat and others for
spectral density types of integrals. $\Gamma_{q}$ is included into the memory
function formalism due to Reiter and Solander, and Menezes, to determine the
dynamic structure function $S(q,\omega)$. For the infinite sized system, the
memory function approach is found to give non-divergent spinwave peaks, and a
smooth nonzero background intensity (``plateau'' or distributed intensity) for
the whole range of frequencies below the spinwave peak. The background
amplitude relative to the spinwave peak rises with temperature, and eventually
becomes higher than the spinwave peak, where it appears as a central peak. For
finite-sized systems, there are multiple sequences of weak peaks on both sides
of the spinwave peaks whose number and positions depend on the system size and
wavevector in integer units of $2\pi/L$. These dynamical finite size effects
are explained in the memory function analysis as due to either spinwave
difference processes below the spinwave peak or sum processes above the

dependence of the tunneling current between a scanning tunneling microscope
(STM) tip and a metallic surface with an individual magnetic adatom. Modeling
the adatom by a nondegenerate Anderson impurity, a general expression is
derived for a weak tunneling current in terms of the dressed impurity Green
function, the impurity-free surface Green function, and the tunneling matrix
elements. This generalizes Fano's analysis to the interacting case. The
differential-conductance lineshapes seen in recent STM experiments with the tip
directly over the magnetic adatom are reproduced within our model, as is the
rapid decay, \sim 10\AA, of the low-bias structure as one moves the tip away
from the adatom. With our simple model for the electronic structure of the
surface, there is no dip in the differential conductance at approximately one
lattice spacing from the magnetic adatom, but rather we see a resonant
enhancement. The formalism for tunneling into small clusters of magnetic
adatoms is developed.

calculating positron states and annihilation characteristics in condensed
matter. The treatment of the electron-positron correlation effects (the
enhancement of the electron density at the positron with respect to mean-field
density) is shown to play a crucial role when calculating the annihilation
rates. A generalized gradient approximation (GGA) takes the strong
inhomogeneities of the electron density in the ion core region into account and
reproduces well the experimental total annihilation rates (inverses of the
positron lifetimes) by suppressing the rates given by a local density
approximation (LDA). The GGA combined with an electron-state-dependent
enhancement scheme gives a good description for the momentum distributions of
the annihilating positron-electron pairs reproducing accurately the trends
observed in the angular correlation (ACAR) or Doppler broadening measurements
of the annihilation radiation. The combination of the present positron lifetime
and momentum density calculations with the corresponding measurements yields a
unique tool for defect identification. Especially, the investigation of various
vacancy-type defects in semiconductors able to trap positrons will be an
important field for these methods. We will show that the identification of
vacancy-impurity complexes in highly n-Type Si and the study of the SiO$_2$/Si

two-loop four-point functions with massless propagators and up to one off-shell

identities, obey also identities resulting from Lorentz-invariance. The
combined set of these identities can be used to reduce the large number of

integrals. We then write down explicitly the differential equations in the
external invariants fulfilled by these master integrals, and point out that the

themselves. We outline strategies for the solution of the differential
equations, and demonstrate the application of the method on several examples.

without any additional assumptions. The two-loop construction of the pinch
technique gluon self-energy, and quark-gluon vertex are carried out in detail
for the case of mass-less Yang-Mills theories, such as perturbative QCD. We
present two different but complementary derivations. First we carry out the
construction by directly rearranging two-loop diagrams. The analysis reveals
that, quite interestingly, the well-known one-loop correspondence between the
pinch technique and the background field method in the Feynman gauge persists
also at two-loops. The renormalization is discussed in detail, and is shown to
respect the aforementioned correspondence. Second, we present an absorptive
derivation, exploiting the unitarity of the $S$-matrix and the underlying BRS
symmetry; at this stage we deal only with tree-level and one-loop physical
amplitudes. The gauge-invariant sub-amplitudes defined by means of this
absorptive construction correspond precisely to the imaginary parts of the
$n$-point functions defined in the full two-loop derivation, thus furnishing a
highly non-trivial self-consistency check for the entire method. Various future

hep-th/9909126 showing that renormalization in quantum field theory is a
special instance of a general mathematical procedure of extraction of finite
values based on the Riemann-Hilbert problem.
  We shall first show that for any quantum field theory, the combinatorics of
Feynman graphs gives rise to a Hopf algebra $\Hc$ which is commutative as an
algebra. It is the dual Hopf algebra of the envelopping algebra of a Lie
algebra $\ud G$ whose basis is labelled by the one particle irreducible Feynman
graphs. The Lie bracket of two such graphs is computed from insertions of one
graph in the other and vice versa. The corresponding Lie group $G$ is the group
of characters of $\Hc$.
  We shall then show that, using dimensional regularization, the bare
(unrenormalized) theory gives rise to a loop $$ \g (z) \in G \qquad z \in C $$
where $C$ is a small circle of complex dimensions around the integer dimension
$D$ of space-time. Our main result is that the renormalized theory is just the
evaluation at $z = D$ of the holomorphic part $\g_+$ of the Birkhoff
decomposition of $\g$.
  We begin to analyse the group $G$ and show that it is a semi-direct product
of an easily understood abelian group by a highly non-trivial group closely
tied up with groups of diffeomorphisms. The analysis of this latter group as
well as the interpretation of the renormalization group and of anomalous
dimensions are the content of our second paper with the same overall title.

on the relevant root system and with values in the respective Cartan
subalgebra, satisfying a certain set of combinatoric identities that ensure, in
one stroke, the existence of a Lax representation and of a dynamical R-matrix,
given by completely explicit formulas. It is shown that among the simple Lie
algebras, only those belonging to the A-series admit such a function F, whereas
the AIII-series of symmetric pairs of Lie algebras, corresponding to the
complex Grassmannians SU(p,q)/S(U(p) x U(q)), allows non-trivial solutions when
|p-q| <= 1. Apart from reproducing all presently known dynamical R-matrices for
Calogero models, our approach provides new ones, namely for the ordinary models
when |p-q| = 1 and for the elliptic models when |p-q| = 1 or p = q.

We propose to bootstrap the quantum theory along the following lines: The
quantum theory is described in terms of matrix elements e.g. of the metric
operator between spectral-transformed multi-vielbein configurations. These
matrix elements are computed exactly as solutions of a recursive system of
functional equations, which in turn is derived from an underlying quadratic
algebra. The Poisson algebra emerging in its classical limit links the
spectral-transformed vielbein and the non-local conserved charges and can be
derived from first principles within the Ernst system. Among the noteworthy
features of the quantum theory are: (i) The issue of (non-)renormalizability is
sidestepped and (ii) there is an apparently unavoidable ``spontaneous''
breakdown of the SL(2,R) symmetry that is a remnant of the 4D diffeomorphism
invariance in the compactified dimensions.

variety X consists of a rational morphism \gamma:X-->T and a compatible family
e_i:G_m\times X-->X, i\in I of rational actions of the multiplicative group G_m
satisfying certain braid-like relations. Such a structure induces a rational
action of W on X. Quite surprisingly, many interesting rational actions of the
group W come from geometric crystals. Also all the known examples of the action
of W which appear in the construction of gamma-functions for the
representations of ^LG in the recent work by A. Braverman and D. Kazhdan come
from geometric crystals. There are many examples of positive geometric crystals
on (G_m)^l, i.e., those geometric crystals for which the actions e_i and the
morphism \gamma are given by positive rational expressions. To each positive
geometric crystal X we associate a Kashiwara's crystal corresponding to the
Langlands dual group ^LG. An emergence of ^LG in the ""crystal world"" was
observed earlier by G. Lusztig. Another application of geometric crystals is a
construction of trivialization which is an W-equivariant isomorhism
X-->\gamma^{-1}(e) \times T for any geometric SL_n-crystal. Unipotent crystals
are geometric analogues of normal Kashiwara crystals. They form a strict
monoidal category. To any unipotent crystal built on a variety X we associate a

simulations of symmetric heavy-ion collisions. The simulations follow a lattice
Hamiltonian extended to relativistic transport. It is demonstrated that in the
peripheral heavy-ion collisions the high-momentum elliptic flow is strongly
sensitive to the momentum dependence of mean field at supranormal densities.
The high transverse-momentum particles are directly and exclusively emitted
from the high-density zone in the collisions, while remaining particles
primarily continue along the beam axis. The elliptic flow was measured by the
KaoS Collaboration as a function of the transverse momentum at a number of
impact parameters in Bi + Bi collisions at 400, 700, and 1000 MeV/nucleon. The
observed elliptic anisotropies in peripheral collisions, which quickly rise
with momentum, can only be explained in simulations when assuming a strong
momentum dependence of nucleonic mean field. This momentum dependence must
strengthen with the rise of density above normal. The mean-field
parametrizations, which describe the data in simulations with various success,
are confronted with mean fields from microscopic nuclear-matter calculations.
Two of the microscopic potentials in the comparisons have unacceptably weak
momentum-dependencies at supranormal densities. The optical potentials from the
Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock calculations, on the other hand, together with the
UV14 + TNI potential from variational calculations, agree rather well within
the region of sensitivity with the parametrized potentials that best describe
the data.

quinone (${\rm Q}$) the acceptor. The parameters are chosen as similar as
possible for both approaches and the quality of the agreement is discussed.

open boundary conditions. We demonstrate the method by applying it to the
Heisenberg XXZ model with general integrable boundary terms.
