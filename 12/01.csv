  RW Aur","28 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ApJ",,"10.1086/308573",,"astro-ph",,"  It is widely accepted that much of the stochastic variability of T Tauri
stars is due to accretion by a circumstellar disk. The emission line spectrum
as well as the excess continuum emission are common probes of this process. In
this communication, we present additional probes of the circumstellar
environment in the form of resonance lines of low ionization potential
elements. Using a set of 14 high resolution echelle observations of the
classical T Tauri star (CTTS), RW Aur, taken between 1986 and 1996, we
carefully measure the continuum veiling at each epoch by comparing more than
500 absorption lines with those of an appropriate template. This allows us to
accurately subtract out the continuum emission and to recover the underlying
photospheric spectrum. In doing so, we find that selected photospheric lines
are enhanced by the accretion process, namely the resonance lines of LiI and
KI. A resonance line of TiI and a low excitation potential line of CaI also
show weak enhancements. Simple slab models and computed line bisectors lead us
to propose that these line enhancements are markers of cool gas at the
beginning of the accretion flow which provides an additional source of line
opacity. These results suggest that published values of surface lithium
abundances of classical T Tauri stars are likely to be overestimated. This
would account for the various reports of surface lithium abundances in excess
of meteoritic values among the extreme CTTS. Computing LTE lithium abundances
of RW Aur in a low and then high accretion state yields abundances which vary
by one order of magnitude. The low accretion state lithium abundance is
consistent with theoretical predictions for a star of this age and mass while
the high accretion state spectrum yields a super-meteoritic lithium abundance.

brightness in the hard X-ray band (2-10 keV flux of 1.2E-11 erg/s/cm2). Our
optical CCD image of the central part of the cluster reveals many member
galaxies which are dimmed substantially by heavy Galactic extinction. We have
measured redshifts of three bright galaxies near the X-ray emission peak and
they are all found to be around z=0.028. The ASCA GIS and ROSAT HRI images show
three aligned X-ray clumps embedded in low surface-brightness X-ray emission
extended by about 30 arcmin. The averaged temperature measured with ASCA is
kT=4.3+/-0.2 keV, which appears to be hot for the bolometric luminosity 1.1E+44
erg/s, when compared to the temperature-luminosity correlation of galaxy
clusters. The irregular X-ray morphology and evidence for a non-uniform
temperature distribution suggest that the system is undergoing a merger of
substructures. Since the sizes and luminosities of the individual clumps are
consistent with those of galaxy groups, Zw1718.1-0108 is interpreted as an
on-going merger of galaxy groups in a dark matter halo forming a cluster of

chemically-distinct, proto-Galactic fragments is investigated using a
Monte-Carlo technique designed to simulate the chemical evolution of the Galaxy
in hierarchical formation scenarios which involve no gas dissipation. By
comparing the observed and simulated metallicity distributions of Galactic
globular clusters and halo field stars, we estimate the level of fragmentation
in the collapsing proto-Galaxy. Although the formation process is highly
stochastic, the simulations often show good agreement with the observed
metallicity distributions, provided the luminosity function of proto-Galactic
fragments had a power-law form with exponent ~ -2. While this steep slope is
strongly at odds with the presently observed luminosity function of the Local
Group, it is in close agreement with the predictions of semi-analytic and
numerical models of hierarchical galaxy formation. We discuss a number of
possible explanations for this discrepancy. These simulations suggest that the
Galactic halo and its globular cluster system were assembled via the accretion
and disruption of approximately 1000 metal-poor, proto-Galactic fragments by
the dominant Galactic building block: a proto-bulge whose own metal-rich
globular clusters system has been preferentially eroded by dynamical processes.
We argue that the same process (ie, hierarchical growth involving little gas
dissipation) is responsible for the formation of both giant elliptical galaxies
and the bulge-halo components of spiral galaxies. (ABRIDGED).

temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB).
  We analytically model a bubbly density perturbation at the beginning of the
radiation dominated era and we apply the linear theory of cosmological
perturbations to compute its time evolution. At decoupling, it uniquely signs
the CMB polarization and temperature anisotropy sky. During evolution the
perturbation propagates beyond the size of the bubble and reaches the CMB sound
horizon at the time considered. Therefore, its signal appears as a series of
concentric rings, each characterized by its own amplitude and sign, on the
scale of 1^{o} on the sky, even if the real seed size is much smaller.
Polarization and temperature rings are strictly correlated. As expected for
linear perturbations with size L and density contrast \delta at decoupling,
\delta T/T is roughly \delta (L/H^{-1})^{2}; the polarization is about 10% of
the temperature anisotropy.
  We predict the impact of a distribution of bubbles on the CMB polarization
and temperature power spectra. Considering models containing both CDM Gaussian
and bubbly non-Gaussian fluctuations, we simulate and analyze 10^{o} x 10^{o}
sky patches with angular resolution of about 3.5^{'}. The CMB power associated
with the bubbles is entirely on sub-degree angular scales (200<= l<=1000), that
will be explored by the forthcoming high resolution CMB experiments with the
percent precision. Depending on the parameters of the bubbly distribution we
find extra-power with respect to the ordinary CDM Gaussian fluctuations; we
infer simple analytical scalings of the power induced by bubbly perturbations
and we constrain our parameters with the existing data.

made in August 1997. The energy bands include radio, millimeter, X-ray, and
gamma-ray. The observations enable us to obtain a complete spectrum of the
source over an energy range of 2 - 500 keV. The spectrum shows that GRS
1758-258 was in its hard state. It is well fitted by the Sunyaev-Titarchuk (ST)
Compton scattering model. The spectrum is also fit by a power law with an
exponential cutoff (PLE) plus a soft black-body component. The temperature of
the soft component is about 1.2 keV, and the energy flux is less than 1.5% of
the total X- and gamma-ray flux. The deduced hydrogen column density is in the
range of (0.93 - 2.0) 10^{22} cm^{-2}. No significant iron lines are detected.
The radio emission has a flat energy spectrum. The daily radio, X-ray and
gamma-ray light curves show that GRS 1758-258 was stable during the observation
period, but was highly variable on smaller time scales in X- and gamma-rays.
The power density spectra are typical for the low-state, but we find the photon
flux for the 5 to 10 keV band to be more variable than that in the other two
energy bands (2 - 5 keV and 10 - 40 keV). Harmonically spaced quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) are observed in the power spectra. The phase lags between
the hard photons and the soft photons have a flat distribution over a wide
range of frequencies. A high coherence of about 1.0 (0.01 - 1 Hz) between the
hard photons and the soft photons is also obtained in our observations. We
compare these results with two variation models. Our millimeter observations
did not reveal any conclusive signatures of an interaction between the jet from

addition to nuclear starbursts in the two colliding galaxies, there are nearby
luminous star forming regions that may be the result of molecular clouds
breaking up and starting to form massive stars as they approach the nuclear
potential. Two regions near the interaction region have very recently formed
massive stars (~4 Myr old). One of these regions in particular appears to have
undergone a starburst of very short duration, in contrast with the 5-10 Myr
durations that are typical of nuclear events. These regions will probably form
gravitationally bound new dwarf galaxies, although they are close enough to the
more massive original galaxies that they will probably eventually be subsumed
into them. In addition, we find 19 HII regions at least as energetic as 30

We tailor our search in order to probe any reverberation signatures of the
fluorescent iron Kalpha line that is thought to arise from the inner regions of
the black hole accretion disk. In essence, an optimal reconstruction algorithm
is applied to the continuum band (2-4keV) light curve which smoothes out noise
and interpolates across the data gaps. The reconstructed continuum band light
curve can then be folded through trial transfer functions in an attempt to find
lags or leads between the continuum band and the iron line band (5-7keV). We
find reduced fractional variability in the line band. The spectral analysis of
Lee et al. (1999) reveals this to be due to a combination of an apparently
constant iron line flux (at least on timescales of few x 10^4s), and flux
correlated changes in the photon index. We also find no evidence for iron line
reverberation and exclude reverberation delays in the range 0.5-50ksec. This
extends the conclusions of Lee et al. and suggests that the iron line flux
remains constant on timescales as short as 0.5ksec. The large black hole mass
(>10^8Msun) naively suggested by the constancy of the iron line flux is
rejected on other grounds. We suggest that the black hole in MCG-6-30-15 has a
mass of M_BH~10^6-10^7Msun and that changes in the ionization state of the disk
may produce the puzzling spectral variability. Finally, it is found that the
8-15keV band lags the 2-4keV band by 50-100s. This result is used to place
constraints on the size and geometry of the Comptonizing medium responsible for
the hard X-ray power-law in this AGN.

bluer-inward color gradient, and recent work suggests that the central
deficiency of bright red giants does not fully account for this gradient. This
study uses Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 images in the F439W and F555W bands,
along with ground-based CCD images with a wider field of view for normalization
of the non-cluster background contribution, and finds \Delta(B-V) ~ +0.3 mag
for the overall cluster starlight over the range r = 2"" to >~ 1'. The slope of
the color profile is: \Delta(B-V)/\Delta\log(r) = 0.20 +/- 0.07 mag dex^{-1}.
We explore various algorithms for artificially redistributing the light of
bright red giants and horizontal branch stars uniformly across the cluster. The
traditional method of redistribution in proportion to the cluster brightness
profile is shown to be inaccurate. There is no significant residual color
gradient in M30 after proper uniform redistribution of all bright evolved
stars; thus the color gradient in M30's central region appears to be due
entirely to post-main-sequence stars. Two classes of plausible dynamical
models, Fokker-Planck and multimass King models, are combined with theoretical
stellar isochrones from Bergbusch & VandenBerg (1992) and from D'Antona et al.
to quantify the effect of mass segregation of main sequence stars. In all
cases, mass segregation of main sequence stars results in \Delta(B-V) ~ -0.06
to +0.02 mag over the range r = 20"" - 80""; this is consistent with M30's
residual color gradient within measurement error. The observed fraction of
evolved star light in the B and V bands agrees with the corresponding model
predictions at small radii but drops below it for r >~ 20"".

galaxies may rival quasars as sources of metagalactic ionizing radiation at
redshifts z > 3. Reionization of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z > 5 may
arise, in part, from the first luminous massive stars. To be an important
source of radiative feedback from star formation, a substantial fraction (\sim
1-10%) of the ionizing photons must escape the gas layers of the galaxies.
Using models of smoothly distributed gas confined by dark-matter (DM)
potentials, we estimate the fraction, f_esc, of Lyc flux that escapes the halos
of spherical galaxies as a function of their mass and virialization redshift.
The gas density profile is found by solving the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium for the baryonic matter in the potential well of a DM halo with the
density profile found by Navarro et. al. (1996). We then perform a parametric
study to understand the dependence of fesc on redshift, mass, star-formation
efficiency (SFE), stellar density distribution, and OB association luminosity
function. We give useful analytical formulas for f_esc(z,M_{DM}). Using the
Press-Schechter formalism, we find that stellar reionization at z \sim 7 is
probably dominated by small galactic sub-units, with M_{DM} \simlt 10^7 M_\odot
and SFE \sim 10 times that in the Milky Way. This may affect the distribution
of heavy elements throughout the intergalactic medium.

matter is distributed at small radii than at large radii, which challenges the
prevailing claim that the baryon fraction increases monotonically with cluster
radius. It shows that the conventional mass estimate using X-ray measurements
of intracluster gas along with a constant mean molecular weight may have
underestimated the total cluster mass by $\sim 20%$, which in turn leads to an
overestimate of the total baryon fraction by the same percentage. Additionally,
it is pointed out that the sedimentation of helium nuclei toward cluster cores

been acquired to derive redshifts for two of the dwarfs, ESO269-066 and

An age - metallicity analysis of the spectra reveals an underlying old and
metal-poor stellar population in both cases. Combining photometric and
spectroscopic results we find strong evidence that indeed all dEs are Cen A
group members. Based on accurate distances published for the two main Cen A
group galaxies NGC5128 and NGC5253, we adopted a mean group distance of 3.96

SBF magnitudes \bar{M}_R of the dEs correlate with the colours (B-R)_0 as good
agreement allows a calibration of the SBF method for dEs in the colour range
0.8<(B-R)_0<1.5. One of the dwarfs, ESO219-010, is located slightly behind the
core of the Cen A group at 4.8 Mpc, while the remaining four recover the mean

are descendant of AGB stars having high equatorial mass loss rates, which
require a stellar binary companion for their existence. These proto-PNs will
become bipolar-PNs, i.e., PNs with two lobes an an equatorial waist between
them, or extreme elliptical PNs. I then derive the conditions for the
enhancement of non-radial density inhomogeneity by the propagation of the
ionization front at the early PN stages. The ionization will proceed faster in
the radial direction along low density regions. The low density regions will be
heated earlier, and they will expand due to their higher pressures, reducing

this transition is deposited in the jet by magnetic fields. The observed
emission is then due to an ultrarelativistic shock wave propagating along the
jet. Good agreement with observational data can be obtained for systems such as
the Galactic jet source SS433. Specifically, we are able to reproduce the
typical observed afterglow emission flux, its spectrum as a function of time,
and the fluence distribution of the corrected data for the 4B BATSE catalogue.
We also studied the relation between the cosmological evolution of our model
and the cosmic ray energy distribution. We used the Star Formation Rate (SFR)
as a function of redshift to obtain the distribution in fluences of GRBs in our
model. The fluence in the gamma ray band has been used to calculate the energy
in cosmic rays both in our Galaxy and at extragalactic distances. This energy
input has been compared with the Galactic and extragalactic spectrum of cosmic
rays and neutrinos. We found that in the context of our model it is not

which has $2 \pi$-periodic minima. We characterize it as type-II intermittency
with external noise through the return map analysis. In $\epsilon_{t} <
\epsilon < \epsilon_{c}$ (where $\epsilon_{t}$ is the bifurcation point of
type-II intermittency and $\epsilon_{c}$ is the PS transition point in coupling
strength parameter space), the average length of the time interval between two
successive jumps follows $<l> \sim \exp(\mid\epsilon_{t} - \epsilon\mid^{2})$,
which agrees well with the scaling law obtained from the Fokker-Planck
equation.

follows a surviving random walk character. Using this theory we have obtained
the complete set of critical decay exponents of the random XY and XX models,
both in the volume and at the surface. The scaling results are confronted with
numerical calculations based on a mapping to free fermions, which then lead to
an exact correspondence with directed walks. The numerically calculated
critical operator profiles on large finite systems (L<=512) are found to follow
conformal predictions with the decay exponents of the phenomenological scaling
theory. Dynamical correlations in the critical state are in average
logarithmically slow and their distribution show multi-scaling character. In
the Griffiths phase, which is an extended part of the off-critical region
average autocorrelations have a power-law form with a non-universal decay

The basic aminoacid-aminoacid potential is Lennard Jones for the native

chosen to make the target secondary structure be the native state of the
system. We provide a thorough equilibrium and kinetic characterization of the
sequences through the molecular dynamics simulations with the Langevin noise.
Models with the steric constraints are found to be better folders and to be
more stable, especially in the case of the $\beta$-structures. Phononic spectra
for vibrations around the native states have low frequency gaps that correlate
with the thermodynamic stability. Folding of the secondary structures proceeds
through a well defined sequence of events. For instance, $\alpha$-helices fold
from the ends first. The closer to the native state, the faster establishment
of the contacts. Increasing the system size deteriorates the folding
characteristics. We study the folding times as a function of viscous friction
and find a regime of moderate friction with the linear dependence. We also
consider folding when one end of a structure is pinned which imitates
instantaneous conditions when a protein is being synthesized. We find that,
under such circumstances, folding of helices is faster and of the
$\beta$-sequences slower.

equilibrium is studied in the framework of the Phi^4 scalar field theory in the
large N limit. The time evolution of a particle distribution in momentum space
(the tsunami) is computed. The effective mass felt by the particles in such a
high density medium equals the tree level mass plus the expectation value of
the squared field. The case of negative tree level squared mass is particularly
interesting. In such case dynamical symmetry restoration as well as dynamical
symmetry breaking can happen. Furthermore, the symmetry may stay broken with
vanishing asymptotic squared mass showing the presence of out of equilibrium
Goldstone bosons. We study these phenomena and identify the set of initial
conditions that lead to each case. We compute the equation of state which turns
to depend on the initial state. Although the system does not thermalize, the
equation of state for asymptotically broken symmetry is of radiation type. We
compute the correlation functions at equal times. The two point correlator for
late times is the sum of different terms. One stems from the initial particle
distribution. Another term accounts for the out of equilibrium Goldstone bosons
created by spinodal unstabilities when the symmetry is asymptotically
broken.Both terms are of the order of the inverse of the coupling for distances
where causal signals can connect the two points. The contribution of the out of
equilibrium Goldstones exhibits scaling behaviour in a generalized sense.

$\mu-e$ conversion in nuclei mediated by the photon--conversion mechanism and
the $\mu \to 3e$ decay are golden plates where the flavor changing leptoquark
couplings, involving the second and third quark generations, can be strongly
constrained. This is due to the fact that these processes get the enhancements
by large $\log(m_q^2/m^2_{LQ})$ terms which are induced by the so-called
``photon-penguin'' diagrams. These enhancements, which produce a mild GIM
suppression in the amplitudes, have not been taken into account in the previous
analyses. We show that the $\mu \to e \gamma$ decay can set weaker constraints
on the LQ models and this is because its amplitude is strongly GIM suppressed
by the terms of order $O(m_q^2/m^2_{LQ})$. We also present the results for the
corresponding constraints in the $\tau$ sector. Finally the prospects of the

static monopoles (like mass or electric charge) or their corresponding currents
by surrounding them in a spherical configuration. We investigate a generation
of fields from primary fields by a scalar coupling. The generated secondary
fields fulfill the condition of source-freedom and therefore cannot occur in a
spherical configuration. The coupling strength depends on the energies of the
primary fields. In most cases these fields can be approximately considered as
dipole fields. We discuss two applications of couplings for electromagnetic and
gravitational spin-1 fields and for electric and magnetic fields. We calculate
for both applications the threshold values of field energy for the maximum
coupling strength. The proposed approach yields to a further step towards an
unification of electromagnetism and gravitation and has important consequences
for the discrete symmetries.

within the multiplier e^2 with the action changes of electric and scalar
charges accelerated in 3+1 space. This coincidence is attributed to the fact
that the Bose and Fermi pairs emitted by a mirror have the same spins 1 and 0
as do the photons and scalar quanta emitted by charges. It is shown that the
propagation of virtual pairs in 1+1 space can be described by the causal
Green's function \Delta_f(z,\mu) of the wave equation for 3+1 space. This is
because the pairs can have any positive mass and their propagation function is
represented by an integral of the causal propagation function of a massive
particle in 1+1 space over mass which coincides with \Delta_f(z,\mu). In this
integral the lower limit \mu is chosen small, but nonzero, to eliminate the
infrared divergence. It is shown that the real and imaginary parts of the
action change are related by dispersion relations, in which a mass parameter
serves as the dispersion variable. They are a consequence of the same relations
for \Delta_f(z,\mu). Therefore, the appearance of the real part of the action
change is a direct consequence of the causality, according to which real part

a ``collective'' Hamiltonian for a few, approximately decoupled, adiabatic

of quantum-mechanical problems. Initially, we study the classical problem
within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics and derive a fully self-consistent
theory of large amplitude collective motion with small velocities. We derive a
measure for the quality of decoupling of the collective degree of freedom. We
show for several simple examples, where the classical limit is obvious, that
when decoupling is good, a quantization of the collective Hamiltonian leads to
accurate descriptions of the low energy properties of the systems studied. In
nuclear physics problems we construct the classical Hamiltonian by means of
time-dependent mean-field theory, and we transcribe our formalism to this case.
We report studies of a model for monopole vibrations, of $^{28}$Si with a
realistic interaction, several qualitative models of heavier nuclei, and
preliminary results for a more realistic approach to heavy nuclei. Other topics

for example the implemention of genuine nonconcave priors. Mixtures of Gaussian
process priors, on the other hand, allow the flexible implementation of complex
and situation specific, also nonconcave ""a priori"" information. This is
essential for tasks with, compared to their complexity, a small number of
available training data. The paper concentrates on the formalism for Gaussian
regression problems where prior mixture models provide a generalisation of
classical quadratic, typically smoothness related, regularisation approaches
being more flexible without having a much larger computational complexity.

constitutive equation for an emulsion can be extrapolated to high shear rates.
We show that the resulting expression is consistent with the rigorous limits of
small drop deformation and that it bears a strong similarity to an a priori
unrelated rheological quantity, namely the dynamic (frequency dependent) linear
shear response. More precisely, within a large parameter region the nonlinear
steady-state shear viscosity is obtained from the real part of the complex
dynamic viscosity, while the first normal stress difference is obtained from
its imaginary part. Our experiments with a droplet phase of a binary polymer
solution (alginate/caseinate) can be interpreted by an emulsion analogy. They
indicate that the predicted similarity rule generalizes to the case of
moderately viscoelastic constituents that obey the Cox-Merz rule.

from any x in {0,1,...,2^m - 1} and y in {0,1,...,2^n - 1} (where m is

the classical probabilistic bounded-error model is exponential in n. This
contrasts sharply with the quantum bounded-error model, where a constant number
of queries suffices.
