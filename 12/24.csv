proper motion of TWA-7, the pair may form a proper motion pair. If the faint
object orbits TWA-7, then its apparent magnitudes of H=$16.42 \pm 0.11$ and

  Multiwavelength Observations of Individual Events","Astronomy and Astrophysics, in press",,"10.1023/A:1005255608792",,"astro-ph",,"  Temporary enhancements of the coronal emission measure in a quiet region have
been shown to constitute a significant energy input. Here some relatively large
events are studied for simultaneous brightenings in transition region lines and
in radio emission. Associated emissions are discussed and tested for
characteristics known from full-sized impulsive flares in active regions.
Heating events and flares are found to have many properties in common,
including (i) associated polarized radio emission, which usually precedes the
emission measure peak (Neupert effect) and sometimes has a non-thermal
spectrum, and (ii) associated and often preceding peaks in O V and He I
emission. On the other hand, heating events also differ from impulsive flares:
(i) In half of the cases, their radio emission at centimeter waves shows a
spectrum consistent with thermal radiation,(ii) the ratio of the
gyro-synchrotron emission to the estimated thermal soft X-ray emission is
smaller than in flares, and (iii) the associated emission in the O V transition
region line shows red shifts and blue shifts, indicating upflows in the rise
phase and downflows in the decay phase, respectively. Nevertheless, the
differences seem to be mainly quantitative, and the analyzed heating events
with thermal energies around 10^26 erg may in principle be considered as
microflares or large nanoflares, thus small versions of regular flares.

  Radio Waves","Astronomy and Astrophysics, in press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The minimum and the mean bandwidth of individual narrowband spikes in two
events in decimetric radio waves is determined by means of multi-resolution
analysis. Spikes of a few tens of millisecond duration occur at
decimetric/microwave wavelength in the particle acceleration phase of solar
flares. A first method determines the dominant spike bandwidth scale based on
their scalegram, the mean squared wavelet coefficient at each frequency scale.
This allows to measure the scale bandwidth independently of heuristic spike
selection criteria, e.g. manual selection. The major drawback is a low
resolution in the bandwidth. To overcome this uncertainty, a feature detection
algorithm and a criterion for spike shape in the time-frequency plane is
applied to locate the spikes. In that case, the bandwidth is measured by
fitting an assumed spike profile into the denoised data. The smallest FWHM
bandwidth of spikes was found at 0.17 % and 0.41 % of the center frequency in
the two events. Knowing the shortest relevant bandwidth of spikes, the slope of
the Fourier power spectrum of this two events was determined and no resemblance
to a Kolmogorov spectrum detected. Additionally the correlation between spike
peak flux and bandwidth was examined.

RSab galaxy NGC 4736 using interferometric and single-dish CO(1-0) data and
previously published Halpha and HI data. The CO morphology is dominated by a
central molecular bar and tightly wound spiral arms associated with a bright
ring of star formation. Strong HI emission is also found in the ring, but HI is
absent from the central regions. Comparison of the HI and Halpha distributions
suggests that HI in the ring is primarily dissociated H$_2$. Modeling of the CO
kinematics reveals gas motion in elliptical orbits around the central bar, and
we argue that the ring represents both the OLR of the bar and the ILR of a
larger oval distortion. The HI kinematics show evidence for axisymmetric inflow
towards the ring and are inconsistent with streaming in aligned elliptical
orbits, but the highly supersonic (~40 km/s) inflow velocities required,
corresponding to mass inflow rates of ~2 Msol/yr, suggest that more
sophisticated models (e.g., gas orbiting in precessed elliptical orbits) should
be considered. The radial CO and Halpha profiles are poorly correlated in the
vicinity of the nuclear bar, but show a better correlation (in rough agreement
with the Schmidt law) at the ring. Even along the ring, however, the azimuthal
correspondence between CO and Halpha is poor, suggesting that massive stars
form more efficiently at some (perhaps resonant) locations than at others.
These results indicate that the star formation rate per unit gas mass exhibits
strong spatial variations and is not solely a function of the available gas
supply. The localization of star formation to the ring is broadly consistent
with gravitational instability theory, although the instability parameter $Q
\sim 3$ on average in the ring, only falling below 1 in localized regions.

Conversely, supernova-driven shocks may trigger star formation in molecular

is responsible for the pollution of the ISM and, if the metal-rich gas can
escape the galaxy's gravitational potential, of the IGM. The environment where
stellar clusters form is populated by a diffuse stellar population which

  Theory of Glasses","10 pages including 4 eps figures",,"10.1073/pnas.97.7.2990",,"cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  A microscopically motivated theory of glassy dynamics based on an underlying
random first order transition is developed to explain the magnitude of free
energy barriers for glassy relaxation. A variety of empirical correlations
embodied in the concept of liquid ""fragility"" are shown to be quantitatively
explained by such a model. The near universality of a Lindemann ratio
characterizing the maximal amplitude of thermal vibrations within an amorphous
minimum explains the variation of fragility with a liquid's configurational
heat capacity density. Furthermore the numerical prefactor of this correlation
is well approximated by the microscopic calculation. The size of heterogeneous
reconfiguring regions in a viscous liquid is inferred and the correlation of
nonexponentiality of relaxation with fragility is qualitatively explained. Thus
the wide variety of kinetic behavior in liquids of quite disparate chemical
nature reflects quantitative rather than qualitative differences in their
energy landscapes.

determine the form of the effective action of the system, finding the explicit
form of the vierbein induced on the brane in terms of the Nambu-Goldstone boson
variables and the bulk vielbein. As was pointed out in the previous paper, the
Kaluza-Klein mode couplings are suppressed by the effect of the brane
fluctuation and the suppression is stronger if the brane tension is smaller.
However, we here show that the brane tension cannot be arbitrarily small since
the inverse of the brane tension gives the coupling constant of the
Nambu-Goldstone bosons. A rather stringent bound is obtained for the brane

explore the possibility that the new interactions remove the chirality

enhance the effect of this coupling by factors of a heavy-mass scale relative
to the s-quark mass. We consider two of the popular models for new physics,

their contributions can be larger than that of the standard model by up to a
few times, which suggests that the yet unobserved Omega^- -> Cascade^- gamma

recently-proposed approach to the gauge hierarchy problem by using this

situation where (some of) the SM particles reside in the five dimensional bulk.
In particular, we find a localization of zero modes of bulk fermions near the
boundary with a negative tension. Unlike the compactification with the flat
metric, these fermion zero modes couple to Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations of the
SM gauge bosons. Interestingly, only low-lying modes of such KK gauge bosons
have non-negligible couplings. Current electroweak precision data give a
constraint that the first KK mode be heavier than 9 TeV. We also argue that at
least the Higgs field should be confined on the brane to utilize the
Randall-Sundrum background as a solution to the gauge hierarchy.

A sharp contrast with remarks found in the literature is pointed out. The
non-conservative system possess a Lagrangian not explicitly dependent on time
and consequently there is a Jacobi's integral. The Lagrange undetermined
multiplier method is used as a complement to obtain a few interesting
conclusions

Phys., 203, 185--210 (1999)","10.1007/s002200050609",,"solv-int nlin.SI",,"  Vertex operators, which are disguised Darboux maps, transform solutions of
the KP equation into new ones. In this paper, we show that the bi-infinite
sequence obtained by Darboux transforming an arbitrary KP solution recursively
forward and backwards, yields a solution to the discrete KP-hierarchy. The
latter is a KP hierarchy where the continuous space x-variable gets replaced by
a discrete n-variable. The fact that these sequences satisfy the discrete KP
hierarchy is tantamount to certain bilinear relations connecting the
consecutive KP solutions in the sequence. At the Grassmannian level, these
relations are equivalent to a very simple fact, which is the nesting of the
associated infinite-dimensional planes (flag).
  It turns out that many new and old systems lead to such discrete
(semi-infinite) solutions, like sequences of soliton solutions, with more and
more solitons, sequences of Calogero-Moser systems, having more and more
particles, band matrices, etc... ; this will be developped in another paper. In
this paper, as an other example, we show that the q-KP hierarchy maps, via a
kind of Fourier transform, into the discrete KP hierarchy, enabling us to write
down a very large class of solutions to the q-KP hierarchy.
