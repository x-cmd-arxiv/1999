phase has been studied for systems in which one member is on its first ascent
of the red giant branch. Three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations have been
carried out for a range of red giant masses (1 - 2 Msun) with degenerate helium
cores (0.28 - 0.45 Msun) and companions (0.1 - 0.45 Msun) for initial orbital
periods ranging from about 15 - 1000 days. The results suggest that these low
mass binary systems can survive the common envelope phase provided that the
helium degenerate core is more massive than about 0.2 - 0.25 Msun and that the
mass of the red giant progenitor is less than about 2 Msun.
  For the observed short period double degenerate systems, it is found that
evolutionary scenarios involving two phases of common envelope evolution are
not likely and that a scenario involving an Algol-like phase of mass transfer
followed by a common envelope phase is viable, suggesting that the first-formed
white dwarf is often reheated by nuclear burning on its surface. A formation
mechanism for two subdwarf B stars observed in eclipsing short period binaries
with low mass main sequence stars is also described.

order to obtain various physical parameters of the recurrent nova. Our U Sco
model consists of a very massive white dwarf (WD) with an accretion disk and a
lobe-filling, slightly evolved, main-sequence star (MS). The model includes a
reflection effect by the companion and the accretion disk together with a
shadowing effect on the companion by the accretion disk. The early visual light
curve (t ~ 1-15 days after maximum) is well reproduced by a thermonuclear
runaway model on a very massive WD close to the Chandrasekhar limit (M_{WD}=
1.37 \pm 0.01 M_\odot), in which optically thick winds blowing from the WD play
a key role in determining the nova duration. The duration of the strong wind
phase (t~0-17 days) is very consistent with the BeppoSAX supersoft X-ray
detection at t~19-20 days because supersoft X-rays are self-absorbed by the
massive wind. The envelope mass at the peak is estimated to be ~3x10^{-6}
M_\odot, which is indicating an average mass accretion rate ~2.5x10^{-7}
M_\odot yr^{-1} during the quiescent phase between 1987 and 1999. These
quantities are exactly the same as those predicted in a new progenitor model of
Type Ia supernovae.

  The objects detected in the ISOGAL survey are found to be late-type M-giants

colour-magnitude diagrams show that mass-loss starts at about M4 and increases
towards later types. Many non-Miras have mass-loss rates similar to
shorter-period Miras.
  The visible counterparts of the ISOGAL sources have been identified in the
database of the MACHO gravitational lensing survey. A first report of this work
is included here. It is found that nearly all the ISOGAL sources are
semi-regular variables (SRVs), which are many times more numerous than Miras.
Their stellar luminosities increase with period. Based on a simple
interpretation of the photometry, mass-loss rates from about 10^{-9} to 10^{-7}
solar masses per year are found for SRVs with periods in excess of about days.

stars (M=13-25 Mo) for various metallicities. We find the following
characteristic abundance patterns of nucleosynthesis in the metal-free (Pop
III) stars. (1) The alpha-nuclei (from C to Zn) are more efficiently produced
than other isotopes, and the abundance pattern of alpha-nuclei can be similar
to the solar abundance. In particular, near solar ratios of alpha elements/Fe
might be a signature of Pop III which could produce a large amount of Fe. (2)
The abundance ratios of odd Z to even Z elements such as Na/Mg and Al/Mg become
smaller for lower metallicity. However, these ratios almost saturate below Z <~
10^{-5}, and [Na, Al/Mg] ~ - 1 for Pop III and low metal Pop II
nucleosynthesis. This result is consistent with abundance pattern of metal poor
stars, in which these ratios also saturate around -1. We suggest that these
stars with the lowest [Na/Mg] or [Al/Mg] may contain the abundance pattern of
Pop III nucleosynthesis. (3) Metal poor stars show interesting trends in the
ratios of [Cr, Mn, Co/Fe]. We discuss that these trends are not explained by
the differences in metallicity, but by the relative thickness between the
complete and the incomplete Si burning layers. Large [Co/Fe] and small [Cr,
Mn/Fe] values found in the observations are explained if mass cut is deep or if
matter is ejected from complete Si burning layer in a form of a jet or bullets.
(4) We also find that primary ^{14}N production occurs in the massive Pop III
stars, because these stars have radiative H-rich envelopes so that the
convective layer in the He-shell burning region can reach the H-rich region.

can occur only at two loop level, contrary to claims in the literature. We
further find that unlike the generic lepto-quark models, the extra
contributions to the dipole moments of the leptons can only be enhanced by
m_b/m_l and not by m_t/m_l relative to the expectations in the Standard Model.
An interesting feature about this enhancement of these dipole moments is that
it does not involve unknown mixing angles. We then use experimental constraints
on the electric dipole moments of electron and neutron to obtain bounds on (the
imaginary part of) products of R-parity violating couplings, and show that
bounds claimed in the literature are too stringent by many orders of magnitude.

putting the third fermion on its positive-energy mass shell. In this way, the
cluster-separated limits are exact, and the Lorentz invariance / cluster
separability requirement is automatically satisfied, provided no supplementary
approximation, like the Born approximation, is made. The use of positive
free-energy projectors in the chosen reductions of the two-fermion
Bethe-Salpeter equations prevents continuum dissolution in our 3D three-fermion
equation. The potentials are hermitian below the inelastic threshold and depend
only slowly on the total three-fermion energy. This ""hand-made"" three-fermion
3D equation is also obtained by starting with an approximation of the
three-fermion Bethe-Salpeter equation, in which the three-body kernel is
neglected and the two-body kernels approached by positive-energy instantaneous
expressions, with the spectator fermion on the mass shell. The neglected terms
are then transformed into corrections to the 3D equation, in three steps
implying each a series expansion. The result is of course complicated, but the
lowest-order contributions of these correction terms to the energy spectrum
remain manageable.We also present some other 3D reduction procedures and

permutation symmetric state vectors and how to derive alternative state vectors
that may be asymmetric for any pair by creating asymmetric interdependencies in
their state descriptions. Because we can choose any pair to create such an
asymmetry, the usual generalized exclusion rules which result, apply
simultaneously to any pair. However, we distinguish between simultaneous
pairwise exclusion rules and the simultaneous pairwise anti-symmetry of the
conventional symmetrization postulate. We show how to construct a variety of
state vectors with multiple interdependencies in their state descriptions and
various exchange asymmetries - including one which is anti-symmetric under
exchange of two bosons - all without violating the spin-statistics theorem. We
conjecture that it is possible to construct state vectors for arbitrary mixes
of bosons and fermions that emulate the conventional symmetrization postulate
in a limited way and give examples. We also prove that it is not possible to
define a single state vector that simultaneously obeys the conventional
symmetrization postulate in its standard form (in which the exchange phase does
not depend on the spins of additional particles that are present) for every
pair that can be interchanged.

Under resonant excitation, the medium absorption can be strongly reduced due to
quantum interference of transitions, while the nonlinear susceptibility is
enhanced. This leads to very efficient energy transfer between the e.m. waves

conversion efficiency is approaching unity in this technique.
