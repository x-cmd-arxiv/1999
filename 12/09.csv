modeling of financial markets. We begin with the Efficient Markets Hypothesis
and describe how this controversial idea has stimulated a number of new
directions of research, some focusing on more elaborate mathematical models
that are captable of rationalizing the empirical facrts, others taking a
completely different different tack in rejecting rationality altogether. One of
the most promising directions is to view financial markets from a biological
perspective and, specifically, with an evolutionary framework in which markets,
instruments, institutions, and investors interact and evolve dynamically
according to the ""law"" of economic selection. Under this view, financial agents
compete and adapt, but they do not necessarily do so in an optimal fashion.
Evolutionary and ecological models of financial markets is truly a new frontier
whose exploration has just begun.

that of the net cluster rotation at larger radii. Current theoretical models do
not predict either this large an increase in the rotation amplitude or such a
change in the PA. However, a central mass concentration, such as a black hole,
could possibly sustain such a configuration. The rotation increase is
consistent with the existence of a central dark mass concentration equal to

time-varying, the corresponding CMB limits are much weaker, particularly for l

fit inclination angle of the source ($i \approx 10^o$) for the medium intensity

stars from the main sequence to the pre-supernova or white dwarf stage is
calculated, as well as the extinction by dust. A simple modeling of the nebular
emission (continuum and lines) is also proposed. PEGASE may be used to model
starbursts as well as old galaxies. The main improvements of PEGASE.2 relative
to PEGASE.1 (Fioc & Rocca-Volmerange 1997) are the following: (1)The stellar
evolutionary tracks of the Padova group for metallicities between 0.0001 and
0.1 have been included; (2)The evolution of the metallicity of the interstellar
medium (ISM) due to SNII, SNIa and AGB stars is followed. Stars are formed with
the same metallicity as the ISM (instead of a solar metallicity in PEGASE.1),
providing thus a metallicity-consistent model; (3)Lejeune et al.'s library of
stellar spectra is used; (4)The extinction by dust is computed for geometries
corresponding to disk and spheroidal galaxies using a radiative transfer code
taking into account the scattering. The main outputs (as a function of time)
are spectra, colors and magnitudes in various photometric systems,
luminosities, type II and Ia supernovae rates, line intensities and equivalent
widths, amount and metallicity of stars and gas, mass locked in stellar
remnants, optical depth and total dust emission. The corresponding article

The SZ effect is a powerful probe of large-scale structure in the universe and

We use moving-mesh hydrodynamical simulations to study the 3-dimensional
statistics of the gas, and compute the mean comptonization parameter and the
angular power spectrum of the SZ fluctuations, for different cosmologies. We
compare these results with predictions using the Press-Schechter formalism. We

discuss this discrepancy, and show that resolution limits the reliability of
our results to the 200<l<2000 range. For cluster- normalized CDM models, the SZ
power spectrum is comparable to the primordial power spectrum around l=2000. We
show that groups and filaments (kT<5 keV) contribute about 50% of the SZ power
spectrum at l=500. About half of the SZ power spectrum on these scales is
produced at redshifts z<0.1, and can thus be detected and removed using
existing catalogs of galaxies and X-ray clusters. We discuss the implications

type of image quality can be obtained in principle simply by fast guiding on a
small (D = 1.5m) telescope at a good site, but only for target objects which
lie within a limited angular distance of a suitably bright guide star. For high
altitude turbulence this 'isokinetic angle' is approximately 1 arcminute. With
a 1 degree field say one would need to track and correct the motions of
thousands of isokinetic patches, yet there are typically too few sufficiently
bright guide stars to provide the necessary guiding information. Our proposed
solution to these problems has two novel features. The first is to use
orthogonal transfer charge-coupled device (OTCCD) technology to effectively
implement a wide field 'rubber focal plane' detector composed of an array of
cells which can be guided independently. The second is to combine measured
motions of a set of guide stars made with an array of telescopes to provide the
extra information needed to fully determine the deflection field. We discuss
the performance, feasibility and design constraints on a system which would
provide the collecting area equivalent to a single 9m telescope, a 1 degree

multi-level atoms and evolve the population of each level with redshift by
including all bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In this framework we
follow several hundred atomic energy levels for H, He I, and He II combined.
The main improvements of this method over previous recombination calculations
are: (1) allowing excited atomic level populations to depart from an
equilibrium distribution; (2) replacing the total recombination coefficient
with recombination to and photoionization from each level directly at each
redshift step; and (3) correct treatment of the He I atom, including the
triplet and singlet states. We find that the ionization fraction x_e = n_e/n_H
is approximately 10% smaller at redshifts <~800 than in previous calculations,
due to the non-equilibrium of the excited states of H, which is caused by the
strong but cool radiation field at those redshifts. In addition we find that He
I recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations, and occurs only
just before H recombination. These changes in turn can affect the predicted
power spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few percent level. Other
improvements such as including molecular and ionic species of H, including
complete heating and cooling terms for the evolution of the matter temperature,
including collisional rates, and including feedback of the secondary spectral
distortions on the radiation field, produce negligible change to x_e. The lower
x_e at low z found in this work affects the abundances of H molecular and ionic
species by 10-25%. However this difference is probably not larger than other
uncertainties in the reaction rates.

dwarf nova EX Dra (formerly HS 1804 + 6753) in order to locate line emitting
sites in the system. Optical spectra recorded during the quiescent as well as
during the outburst state have been analysed by means of Doppler tomography.
The computed Doppler images map the system in a variety of emission lines and
allow us to compare between different temperatures and accretion states.
  Our studies revealed that the Balmer and HeI emission of EX Dra during
quiescence is mainly formed within a fully established disk and within the gas
stream. The Doppler map of H_alpha shows a second emission spot in the
accretion disk located far from the region of interaction between the as stream
and the accretion disk.
  We have found a weak hint that secondary star emission contributes to the
H_alpha line in quiescence, obviously caused by photospheric heating due to
irradiation by the primary component. During outburst secondary star emission
turns into a very strong emission source in the Balmer lines due to the
increased accretion rate and an enhanced irradiation by the white dwarf or the
boundary layer. The Doppler maps of the Balmer and HeI lines during outburst
further show emission from the accretion disk. During outburst the gas stream
is rarely seen in the Balmer lines but clearly visible in HeI and shows that
the disk radius during this high accretion state is about 0.2 R_L1 larger than
during the recorded quiescent state.
  The origin of the CII (4267 Angstroem) line, which is only detectable during
outburst can be located by Doppler imaging close to the primary component and
may therefore be formed in the chromosphere of the white dwarf.

gravitational lensing effects on, e.g., supernova luminosity versus redshift

generalized in several ways: First, the matter content is allowed to consist of
several different types of fluids, possibly with non-vanishing pressure.
Second, besides lensing by simple point masses and singular isothermal spheres,
the more realistic halo dark matter distribution proposed by Navarro, Frenk &
White (NFW), based on N-body simulation results, is treated. We discuss various
aspects of the accuracy of the method, such as luminosity corrections, and
statistics, for multiple images. We find in agreement with other recent work
that a large sample of supernovae at large redshift could be used to extract
gross features of the mass distribution of the lensing dark matter halos, such
as the existence of a large number of point-like objects. The results for the
isothermal sphere and the NFW model are, however, very similar if normalized to
the observed luminosity distribution of galaxies. We give convenient analytical
fitting formulas for our computed lensing probabilites as a function of
magnification, for several redshifts.

allow instability of the quiescent basic state at some critical Hartmann

Restricting the whole problem to two spatial dimensions, this mode is followed
up to a time-asymptotic steady state, which proves to be sensitive to
three-dimensional perturbations even close to the point where the primary
instability sets in. A comprehensive three-dimensional stability analysis of
the two-dimensional steady tearing-mode state is performed by varying
parameters of the sheet pinch. The instability with respect to
three-dimensional perturbations is suppressed by a sufficiently strong magnetic
field in the invariant direction of the equilibrium. For a special choice of
the system parameters, the unstably perturbed state is followed up in its
nonlinear evolution and is found to approach a three-dimensional steady state.

of interaction (nonzero only at locations of particles) and energy density of

a spherical body differing (in space part of metric in the first nonlinear

  More explicitly, we consider a filtration of $A_{n}(k)$ induced by any vector
$(u,v) \in {\mathbb Z}^{n}\times {\mathbb Z}^{n}$ such that the associated
graded algebra is the commutative polynomial ring in $2n$ indeterminates. The

involutive and this implies that its irreducible components have dimension at

physical submanifolds which are not preserved by the action of the (broken)
global U(1) group.

quantum operations and classical communication. We show that, for any
reversible transformation, the relative entropy of entanglement for two parties
must remain constant. This shows, for example, that it is not possible to
convert 2N three party GHZ states into 3N singlets, even in an asymptotic
sense. Thus there is true three-party non-locality (i.e., not all three-party
entanglement is equivalent to two-party entanglement). Our results also allow
us to make {\em quantitative} statements about concentrating multi-particle
entanglement. Finally, we show that there is true n-party entanglement for all
n.

quantum computation is shown to preserve fault tolerance. Errors committed in
the course of simulation are eliminated by the natural error-correcting

non-abelian anyons. The latter is shown to provide universal robust quantum
computation via simulation.

accompanied by a local observable effect. We show that such effects manifest a
complementarity between non-local and local attributes of the topology, which
is reminiscent but yet different from the usual wave-particle complementarity.
This complementarity is not a consequence of non-commutativity, rather it is
due to the non-canonical nature of the observables. We suggest that a
local/non-local complementarity is a general feature of topological effects
that are ``dual'' to the AB effect.

for low impinging velocities and at all impact parameters. The effect
disappears for packets more extended than the well. Experiments to detect the
polychotomous behavior are suggested.

interpretation of the A-A experiment, and show the adequacy of the H-K theory.
In Part II we examine the belief that H-K reductions produce self contradicting
causal loops, and/or give rise to absurd boundary conditions. These objections
to the theory are shown to be unfounded.
