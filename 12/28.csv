pulsar using the Whipple Observatory's 10 m gamma-ray telescope. The direction
of the Crab pulsar was observed for a total of 73.4 hours between 1994 November

its lowest energy threshold to date. Spectral analysis techniques were applied
to search for the presence of a gamma-ray signal from the Crab pulsar over the
energy band 250 GeV to 4 TeV. We do not see any evidence of the 33 ms
pulsations present in other energy bands from the Crab pulsar. The 99.9%
confidence level upper limit for pulsed emission above 250 GeV is derived to be
4.8x10^-12 cm^-2 s^-1 or <3% of the steady flux from the Crab Nebula. These
results imply a sharp cut-off of the power-law spectrum seen by the EGRET
instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory. If the cut-off is exponential,
it must begin at 60 GeV or lower to accommodate these upper limits.

relatively nearby source corresponds to $\sim$ 0.4 h$^{-1}$ pc. Comparison
between two epochs separated by 66 days reveals no apparent motions in the
inner 7 mas jet structure above an upper limit of $\sim 1.4 h^{-1}$ c. This
value, the absence of detectable counterjet emission from the presumably
symmetric jet, plus the presence of extended double-lobe structure, are
consistent with the knots in the jet being stationary features such as standing
shocks. The jet intensity declines with the angular distance from the core as
$\phi^{-1.68}$. This is more gradual than that derived for 3C~120,
$\phi^{-1.86}$, for which there is evidence for strong intereactions between
the jet and ambient medium. This suggests that in 3C~371 there is a greater
level of {\it in situ} acceleration of electrons and amplification of magnetic
field. We interpret sharp bends in the jet at sites of off-center knots as
further evidence for the interaction between the jet and external medium, which
may also be responsible for the generation of standing recollimation shocks.
These recollimation shocks may be responsible for the presumably stationary
components. The radio properties of 3C~371 are intermediate between those of
other radio galaxies with bright cores and those of BL Lacertae objects.

implies that low mass stars in a globular cluster (GC) should have formed in
the gas already enriched by the first generation of SNII.

that doping a half-filled Hubbard chain leads to the appearance of charged

Compton scattering amplitude by performing the general operator product
expansion (OPE) and the formal renormalization group (RG) analysis.
  We discuss the general tensorial decomposition of the amplitude to obtain the
invariant amplitudes in the non-forward kinematic region. We study the OPE to
identify the relevant operators and their reduced matrix elements, as well as
the corresponding Wilson coefficients. We find that the OPE now should be done
in double moments with new moment variables. There are in the expansion new
sets of leading twist operators which have overall derivatives. They mix under
renormalization in a well-defined way. We compute the evolution kernels from
which the anomalous dimensions for these operators can be extracted. We also
obtain explicitly the lowest order Wilson coefficients.
  In the high energy limit we find the explicit form of the dominantly
contributing anomalous dimensions. We are then able to solve the resulting
renormalization group equations (RGE) and give a prediction of the high energy
behavior of the invariant amplitudes. We find that it is the same as is
indicated by the conventional double leading logarithmic analysis.

space. The metric is given explicitly in terms of three parameters,
$\widetilde{M}$, $ \widetilde{Q}$ and $\omega $ which are the ``rest mass'' and
``rest charge'' and the angular velocity of the boost. These parameters are
related to M, J and Q through the solution of an algebraic cubic equation.
Altogether, even without angular momentum, the electrically charged 2+1 black
hole is somewhat pathological since (i) it exists for arbitrarily negative
values of the mass, and (ii) there is no upper bound on the electric charge.

produces a strong softening of the equation of state, which turns out almost
independent on the nucleon-nucleon interaction. We use the new equation of
