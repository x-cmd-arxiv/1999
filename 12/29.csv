information from the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and the color-color
diagrams, a sample of 98 highly probable main sequence cluster members with
high photometric accuracy is isolated. From this sample, adopting the intrinsic
color relation of Olsen (1988), E(b-y) = 0.062 +/- 0.003 and [Fe/H] = +0.077
+/- 0.012, where the errors quoted are the standard errors of the mean and
refer to the internal errors alone. Use of the Nissen (1988) intrinsic color
relation produces E(b-y) = 0.071 and [Fe/H] = +0.115. Adopting the lower
reddening, a direct main-sequence fit to the Hyades with (m-M) = 3.33 leads to
(m-M) = 10.15, while isochrones with convective overshoot and zeroed to the
Hyades produce an age of 1.7 +/- 0.1 Gyr, with an excellent match to the
morphology of the turnoff. The higher reddening produces (m-M) = 10.3 and an
age lower by 0.1 Gyr. Comparison with the CMD of NGC 3680 shows that the two
clusters have virtually identical morphology which, in combination with their
similar compositions, produces identical ages. Coincidentally, the shifts in
the CMD necessary to superpose the two clusters require that the apparent
moduli of IC 4651 and NGC 3680 be the same, while E(b-y)(4651) = E(b-y)(3680) +

wind bubbles and superbubbles. Classical theory suggests that it should be hot,
with characteristic temperatures of order a million degrees. This temperature
should be set by the balance between heating by the internal termination shocks
of the central stellar winds and supernovae, which expand at thousands of km/s,
and cooling by conductive evaporation of cold gas off the shell walls. However,
if the hot interior gas becomes dense enough due to evaporation or ablation off
of interior clouds, it will cool in less than a dynamical time, leading to a
cold interior. The observational evidence appears mixed. On the one hand, X-ray
emission has been observed from both stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles. On
the other hand, no stellar wind bubble or superbubble has yet been observed
emitting at the rate predicted by the classical theory: they are either too
faint or too bright, by up to an order of magnitude. Alternate explanations
have been proposed for the observed emission, including off-center supernova
remnants hitting the shell walls of superbubbles, and residual emission from
highly-ionized gas out of coronal equilibrium. Furthermore, the structures of
post-main sequence stellar wind bubbles, expanding into what are presumably old
stellar wind bubbles, appear in at least some cases to show that the bubble
interior is cold, not hot. (The classical example of this is NGC 6888.) What is
the actual state of bubble and superbubble interiors?

probably settle into a thin ``dust layer'' at the midplane. A velocity
difference between the dust layer and the gas gives rise to turbulence, which
prevents further settling and direct gravitational instability of the layer.
The associated drag on the surface of the layer causes orbital decay in a few
thousand years---as opposed to a few hundred years for an isolated meter-sized
body. Within this widely-accepted theoretical framework, we show that the
turbulent drag causes radial instabilities even if the selfgravity of the layer
is negligible. We formulate axisymmetric, height-integrated dynamical equations
for the layer that incorporate turbulent diffusion of mass and momentum in
radius and height, vertical settling, selfgravity, and resistance to
compression due to gas entrained within the dust layer. In steady-state, the
equations describe the inward radial drift of a uniform dust layer. In
perturbation, overdense rings form on an orbital timescale with widths
comparable to the dust-layer thickness. Selfgravity is almost irrelevant to the
linear growth rate but will eventually fragment and collapse the rings into
planetesimals larger than a kilometer. We estimate that the drag instability is
most efficient at 1 AU when most of the ``dust'' mass lies in the size range
0.1-10 meters.

their sizes and masses are similar to those of present star-forming regions,
their temperatures are expected to be much higher because cooling is provided
only by trace amounts of molecular hydrogen. Several recent simulations of the
collapse and fragmentation of primordial clouds have converged on a thermal
regime where the density is about 10^3-10^4 cm^{-3} and the temperature is
about 300 K; under these conditions the Jeans mass is of the order of 10^3
M_sun, and all of the simulations show the formation of clumps with masses of
this order. The temperatures in these clumps subsequently rise slowly as they
collapse, so little if any further fragmentation is expected. As a result, the
formation of predominantly massive or very massive stars is expected, and star
formation with a normal present-day IMF seems very unlikely. The most massive
early stars are expected to collapse to black holes, and these in turn are
predicted to end up concentrated near the centers of present-day large
galaxies. Such black holes may play a role in the origin of AGNs, and the heavy
elements produced by somewhat less massive stars also formed at early times may
play an important role in chemically enriching the inner parts of large
galaxies and quasars.

directly computing forces on particles in an hierarchical grouping scheme with
the extremely efficient mesh based PM structured approach. The combined TPM
algorithm takes advantage of the fact that gravitational forces are linear
functions of the density field. Thus one can use domain decomposition to break
down the density field into many separate high density regions containing a
significant fraction of the mass but residing in a very small fraction of the
total volume. In each of these high density regions the gravitational potential
is computed via the tree algorithm supplemented by tidal forces from the
external density distribution. For the bulk of the volume, forces are computed
via the PM algorithm; timesteps in this PM component are large compared to
individually determined timesteps in the tree regions. Since each tree region
can be treated independently, the algorithm lends itself to very efficient
parallelization using message passing. We have tested the new TPM algorithm (a
refinement of that originated by Xu 1995) by comparison with results from
Ferrell & Bertschinger's P^3M code and find that, except in small clusters, the
TPM results are at least as accurate as those obtained with the
well-established P^3M algorithm, while taking significantly less computing
time. Production runs of 10^9 particles indicate that the new code has great

electrons are injected only into crossing subbands, the differential
conductance is $4e^2/h$. At applied voltages larger than $\Delta E_{NC}/2e$
($\Delta E_{NC}$ is the energy level spacing of first non crossing subbands),
electrons are injected into non crossing subbands. The contribution of these
electrons to current is determined by the competing processes of Bragg
reflection and Zener type inter subband tunneling. In small diameter nanotubes,
Bragg reflection dominates, and the maximum differential conductance is
comparable to $4e^2/h$. Inter subband Zener tunneling can be non negligible as
the nanotube diameter increases because $\Delta E_{NC}$ is inversely
proportional to the diameter. As a result, with increasing nanotube diameter,
the differential conductance becomes larger than $4e^2/h$, though not
comparable to the large number of subbands into which electrons are injected

into account. In particular, Ga(1-x)In(x)As QWR's grown by SILO process are
considered. A VFF model is used to find the equilibrium atomic positions in the
SILO QWR structure by minimizing the lattice energy. The strain tensor at each
atomic(In or GA) site is then obtained and included in the calculations of
electronic states and optical peroperties. It is found that different local
arrangement of atoms leads to very different strain distribution, which in term
alters the optical properties. In particular, we found that the optical
anisotropy can be reversed due to the change in shear strain caused by the
inter-change of atomic positions. Good agreement with the existing experimental
data on band gap and optical anisotropy can be obtained when a 2D alloy
structure with lateral composition modulation in the InAs/GaAs interface planes

based on the process of splitting a beam of photons on a beam splitter, a
quantum mechanical source of true randomness. By utilizing either a beam
splitter or a polarizing beam splitter, single photon detectors and high speed
electronics the presented devices are capable of generating a binary random
signal with an autocorrelation time of 11.8 ns and a continuous stream of
random numbers at a rate of 1 Mbit/s. The randomness of the generated signals
and numbers is shown by running a series of tests upon data samples. The
devices described in this paper are built into compact housings and are simple
to operate.

and Takebe, the twistor construction of solution structure for the
dispersionless modified KP hierarchy is given.
