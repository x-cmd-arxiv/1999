simulate Galaxy Formation and Evolution. The code has been parallelized using
SHMEM, a Cray proprietary library to handle communications between the 256

by the Cineca Supercomputing Center (Bologna, Italy). The code combines the
Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method to solve hydro-dynamical equations
with the popular Barnes and Hut (1986) tree-code to perform gravity calculation
with a NlogN scaling, and it is based on the scalar Tree-SPH code developed by
Carraro et al(1998)[MNRAS 297, 1021]. Parallelization is achieved distributing
particles along processors according to a work-load criterion. Benchmarks, in
terms of load-balance and scalability, of the code are analyzed and critically
discussed against the adiabatic collapse of an isothermal gas sphere test using
20,000 particles on 8 processors. The code results balanced at more that 95%
level. Increasing the number of processors, the load-balance slightly worsens.
The deviation from perfect scalability at increasing number of processors is
almost negligible up to 32 processors. Finally we present a simulation of the
formation of an X-ray galaxy cluster in a flat cold dark matter cosmology,
using 200,000 particles and 32 processors, and compare our results with Evrard

star formation, feed-back from SNae of type II and Ia, stellar winds and UV
flux from massive stars, and an algorithm to follow the chemical enrichment of
the inter-stellar medium. Simulations with some of these ingredients are also

our cluster size estimates indicate that they are gravitationally bound, and
not unlike Galactic globular clusters, their luminosity distribution is
significantly fainter than both super star cluster luminosity functions (LFs)

clusters, since their luminosities will fade further before they are of similar

give rise to quasar activity. BH binary mergers could therefore be responsible

  15 September 1999 to ApJ; awaiting referee's report",,"10.1086/308969",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent observations suggest that neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries
rotate within a narrow range of spin frequencies clustered around 300 Hz. A
proposed explanation for this remarkable fact is that gravitational radiation
from a steady-state r-mode oscillation in the neutron star's core halts the
spin-up due to accretion. For the neutron star transients, balancing the
time-averaged accretion torque with gravitational wave emission from
steady-state, constant amplitude r-mode pulsations implies a quiescent
luminosity too bright to be consistent with observations (in particular of Aql
X-1). The viscous dissipation (roughly 10 MeV per accreted nucleon for a spin
of 300 Hz) from such an r-mode makes the core sufficiently hot to power a
thermal luminosity of order 1e34 erg/s when accretion halts. This is the
minimum quiescent luminosity that the neutron star must emit when viscous
heating in the core is balanced by radiative cooling from the surface, as is
the case when the core of the star is superfluid. We therefore conclude that
either the accretion torque is much less than (dM/dt)(GMR)^{1/2}, or that a
steady-state r-mode does not limit the spin rate of the neutron star
transients. Future observations with AXAF and XMM promise to further constrain
the amount of viscous dissipation in the neutron star core.

Zee et al. 1997). Generalized to all galaxies, the low continuous SFR scenario
accounts for various facts: the presence of star formation in quiescent dwarfs
and LSBG, the metallicity increase with time in the most underabundant DLA
systems, and the metal content extrapolations to the outskirts of spiral
galaxies. Also the apparent absence of galaxies with a metallicity lower than
IZw 18, the apparent absence of HI clouds without optical counterparts, and the
homogeneity of abundances in dwarfs galaxies are natural outcomes of the
scenario. This implies that, even if starbursts are strong and important events
in the life of galaxies, their more subdued but continuous star formation
regime cannot be ignored when accounting for their chemical evolution.

a mean tangential shear around a stacked sample of foreground galaxies in three

high statistical significance. The shear profile is well described by a
power-law. A variety of rigorous tests demonstrate the reality of the
gravitational lensing signal and confirm the uncertainty estimates. We
interpret our results by modeling the mass distributions of the foreground
galaxies as approximately isothermal spheres characterized by a velocity
dispersion and a truncation radius. The velocity dispersion is constrained to
be 150-190 km/s at 95% confidence (145-195 km/s including systematic
uncertainties), consistent with previous determinations but with smaller error
bars. Our detection of shear at large angular radii sets a 95% confidence lower
limit $s>140^{\prime\prime}$, corresponding to a physical radius of $260h^{-1}$
kpc, implying that galaxy halos extend to very large radii. However, it is
likely that this is being biased high by diffuse matter in the halos of groups
and clusters. We also present a preliminary determination of the galaxy-mass
correlation function finding a correlation length similar to the galaxy
autocorrelation function and consistency with a low matter density universe

spectroscopic redshifts for the foreground galaxies, making it possible to
greatly improve the precision of these constraints, measure additional

Two approaches to extinction correction are considered. Owing to the low

Six of the events, including five established ``Branch-normal'' supernovae show
similar coeval magnitudes. Two of these, SNe 1989B and 1998bu, were observed
near maximum infrared light. This occurs about 5 days {\it before} maximum blue

universe from the realm of theoretical possibility to within the grasp of
observations. The global topology of the universe modifies the correlation
properties of cosmic fields. In particular, strong correlations are predicted
in CMB anisotropy patterns on the largest observable scales if the size of the
Universe is comparable to the distance to the CMB last scattering surface. We
describe in detail our completely general scheme using a regularized method of
images for calculating such correlation functions in models with nontrivial
topology, and apply it to the computationally challenging compact hyperbolic
spaces. Our procedure directly sums over images within a specified radius,
ideally many times the diameter of the space, effectively treats more distant
images in a continuous approximation, and uses Cesaro resummation to further
sharpen the results. At all levels of approximation the symmetries of the space
are preserved in the correlation function. This new technique eliminates the
need for the difficult task of spatial eigenmode decomposition on these spaces.
Although the eigenspectrum can be obtained by this method if desired, at a
given level of approximation the correlation functions are more accurately
determined. We use the 3-torus example to demonstrate that the method works
very well. We apply it to power spectrum as well as correlation function
evaluations in a number of compact hyperbolic (CH) spaces. Application to the
computation of CMB anisotropy correlations on CH spaces, and the observational
constraints following from them, are given in a companion paper.

the free-free emission from the intracluster (IC) plasma surrounding the
source. Above 10 keV we find evidence for the existence of flux in excess with
respect to the free-free IC plasma emission. This, together with the marginal
detection of a neutral iron line at $\sim 6.4$ keV, gives a strong indication
for the presence of an AGN deeply buried within the source. This component is
best modelled by a strongly absorbed (N_H > 5 10^{24} cm^{-2}) power-law plus
unabsorbed reflection spectrum (0.15<R<0.3), which is also responsible for the
cold iron line. The unabsorbed broad-band (2-100 keV) X-ray emission of this

results indicate that IRAS 09104+4109 is indeed the prototype of a rare class

surface brightness of the system while changing the shape and the major-axis
orientation of the system. A family of analytical models are given as functions
of the distance ($D_0$) to the object and the amount ($\gamma$) of the
superimposed PS density. The PS density, different from the well-known konuses
of extragalactic systems, makes the luminosity of the system vary slightly with
the distance $D_0$. The physical ranges for $\gamma$ and the major axis angles

represented by a square-well form. We have found that the introduction of the
Coulomb repulsion \lambda_C, increasing the ''contrast'' | \lambda | + |
\lambda_C |, or the depth of the angular modulation of \lambda (\phi), leads to
a remarkable enhancement of T_c. This effect can be optimized by combining
attractive (\lambda <0) and repulsive (\lambda >0) interactions along stripes
and perpendicular to them.

applying mathematical concepts drawn, in particular, from differential geometry
and topology, to the physics of Hamiltonian dynamical systems with many degrees
of freedom of interest for statistical mechanics. The first part of the paper
concerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to
study the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity
between the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its
configuration space, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed,
which sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact,
it appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was
originally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures
are fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large
number of degrees of freedom it is possible to give an analytical estimate of
the largest Lyapunov exponent by means of a geometric model independent of the
dynamics. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions
is addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a
system undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the
configuration-space curvature exhibit a singular behavior at the phase
transition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models.
In these models the origin of the singular behavior of the curvature
fluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration
space. This leads us to put forward a Topological Hypothesis (TH). The content
of the TH is that phase transitions would be related at a deeper level to a
change in the topology of the configuration space of the system.

with definite parities, the problem is mapped onto a Kondo model for the
even-parity channel plus free electrons in the odd-parity channel. States of
opposite parities decouple for values of the flux corresponding to periodic or
antiperiodic boundary conditions. For these special cases, the model is solved
exactly by a Bethe ansatz, allowing for an exact calculation of the charge
persistent current. In particular we show that the charge stiffness in the
special case of spin-independent fluxes is insensitive to the presence of the

gauge-boson-propagator corrections are parametrized by the three oblique
parameters Sz, Tz and mw. The oblique corrections, the Zqq and Zll vertex
corrections, and the vertex and box corrections to the \mu-decay width are
separately studied in detail. We first study individual contribution from the
four sectors of the model, the squarks, the sleptons, the supersymmetric
fermions (charginos and neutralinos), and the supersymmetric Higgs bosons, to
the universal oblique parameters, where the sum of individual contributions
gives the total correction. We find that the light squarks or sleptons, whose
masses just above the present direct search limits, always make the fit worse
than that of the Standard Model (SM), whereas the light charginos and
neutralinos generally make the fit slightly better. The contribution from the
supersymmetric Higgs sector is found small. We then study the vertex/box
corrections carefully when both the supersymmetric fermions (-inos) and the
supersymmetric scalars (squarks and sleptons) are light, and find that no
significant improvement over the SM fit is achieved. The best overall fit to
the precision measurements are found when charginos of mass $\sim 100\gev$ with
a dominant wino-component are present and the doublet squarks and sleptons are
all much heavier. The improvement over the SM is marginal, however, where the
total \chi^2 of the fit to the 22 data points decreases by about one unit, due
mainly to a slightly better fit to the $Z$-boson total width.

First, there is a rapid change in the viscosity of up to one order of

by quantum measurement (in particular, the constraint that there is only one

and final conditions, justifies the quantum computation speed-up and is not
representable inside dynamics, namely as a one-way propagation. In this work,
we reformulate von Neumann's model of quantum measurement at the light of above
findings. We embed it in a broader representation based on the quantum logic
gate formalism and capable of describing the interplay between dynamical and
non-dynamical constraints. The two steps of the original model, namely (1)
dynamically reaching a complete entanglement between pointer and quantum object
and (2) enforcing the one-outcome-constraint, are unified and reversed. By
representing step (2) right from the start, the same dynamics of step (1)

PT-symmetrically regularized and continued to the whole real line. The new
model remains exactly solvable and its bound states remain proportional to
Jacobi polynomials. Its real and discrete spectrum exhibits several unusual
features.
  Version 2: Parity times time-reversal symmetry of complex Hamiltonians with
real spectra is usually interpreted as a weaker mathematical substitute for
Hermiticity. Perhaps an equally important role is played by the related
strengthened analyticity assumptions. In a constructive illustration we
complexify a few potentials solvable only in s-wave. Then we continue their
domain from semi-axis to the whole axis and get the new exactly solvable
models. Their energies come out real as expected. The new one-dimensional
spectra themselves differ quite significantly from their s-wave predecessors.

periodic potentials. We construct dynamical symmetry Hamiltonians for the Scarf
potential and its extensions using representations of su(1,1) and so(2,2).
Energy bands and gaps are readily understood in terms of representation theory.
We compute the transfer matrices and dispersion relations for these systems,
and find that the complementary series plays a central role as well as
non-unitary representations.

splitting of gl(infinity) into sp(infinity) and lower-triangular matrices. We
establish a set of bilinear identities, which we show to be equivalent to the
Pfaff Lattice. In the semi-infinite case, the tau-functions are Pfaffians;
interesting examples are the matrix integrals over symmetric matrices
(symmetric matrix integrals) and matrix integrals over self-dual quaternionic
Hermitean matrices (symplectic matrix integrals).
  There is a striking parallel of the Pfaff lattice with the Toda lattice, and
more so, there is a map from one to the other. In particular, we exhibit two
maps, dual to each other,
  (i) from the the Hermitean matrix integrals to the symmetric matrix
integrals, and
  (ii) from the Hermitean matrix integrals to the symplectic matrix integrals.
  The map is given by the skew-Borel decomposition of a skew-symmetric
operator. We give explicit examples for the classical weights.
