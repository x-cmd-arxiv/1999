the change in solar activity indices. The empirical relations are determined on
the basis of frequencies obtained from BBSO and GONG stations during solar
cycle 22. These relations are applied to estimate the change in mean frequency
for the cycle 21 and 23. A remarkable agreement between the calculated and
observed frequency shifts for the ascending phase of cycle 23 indicates that
the derived relations are independent of epoch and do not change significantly
from cycle to cycle. We propose that these relations could be used to estimate
the shift in p-mode frequencies for past, present and future solar activity
cycles, if the solar activity index is known. The maximum frequency shift for
cycle 23 is estimated to be 265 \pm 90 nHz corresponding to the predicted
maximum smoothed sunspot number 118.1 \pm 35.

spin history of the accretion-powered pulsar GX 1+4 that is very likely to be a
signature of the orbital period of the system. Using BATSE public-domain data,
we show a highly-significant periodic modulation of the pulsar frequency from
1991 to date which is in excellent agreement with the ephemeris proposed by
Cutler, Dennis & Dolan in 1986, which were based on a few events of enhanced
spin-up that occurred during the pulsar's spin-up era in the 1970s. Our results
indicate that the orbital period of GX 1+4 is 303.8+-1.1 days, making it by far
the widest low-mass X-ray binary system known. A likely scenario for this
system is an elliptical orbit in which the neutron star decreases its spin-down
rate (or even exhibits a momentary spin-up behavior) at periastron passages due
to the higher torque exerted by the accretion disk onto the magnetosphere of
the neutron star.

physicists. The problem has a flavor of statistical mechanics, but possesses
the most common feature of most biological problems -- the profound effects of
evolution. I will give an introduction to the problem, and then focus on some
recent work concerning the so-called ``designability principle''. The
designability of a structure is measured by the number of sequences that have
that structure as their unique ground state. Structures differ drastically in
terms of their designability; highly designable structures emerge with a number
of associated sequences much larger than the average. These highly designable
structures 1) possess ``proteinlike'' secondary structures and motifs, 2) are
thermodynamically more stable, and 3) fold faster than other structures. These
results suggest that protein structures are selected in nature because they are
readily designed and stable against mutations, and that such selection
simultaneously leads to thermodynamic stability and foldability. According to
this picture, a key to the protein folding problem is to understand the
emergence and the properties of the highly designable structures.

of $T$ and $H$, large spectral weight changes were observed up to 4.0 eV. These
spectral weight changes could be explained using the polaron picture.
Interestingly, our results suggested that some local ordered state might remain
above the charge ordering temperature, and that the charge/orbital melted state
at a high magnetic field (i.e. at $H=$ 17 T and $% T=$ 4.2 K) should be a three
dimensional ferromagnetic metal. We also investigated the first order phase
transition from the charge/orbital ordered state to ferromagnetic metallic
state using the $T$- and $H$% -dependent dielectric constants $\epsilon_1$. In
the charge/orbital ordered insulating state, $\epsilon_1$ was positive and
$d\epsilon_1/d\omega \approx 0$. With increasing $T$ and $H$, $\epsilon_1$ was
increased up to the insulator-metal phase boundaries. And then, $\epsilon_1$
abruptly changed into negative and $d\epsilon_1/d\omega >0$, which was
consistent with typical responses of a metal. Through the analysis of $%
\epsilon_1$ using an effective medium approximation, we found that the melting
of charge/orbital ordered states should occur through the percolation of
ferromagnetic metal domains.

by mapping them to a first-quantized quantum mechanical model of a particle
moving in a multi-dimensional periodic potential with Ohmic dissipation. From a
renormalization group analysis, we obtain phase diagrams of the quantum
Brownian motion model with various lattice symmetries. For a symmorphic
lattice, there are two phases at T=0: a localized phase in which the particle
is trapped in a potential minimum, and a free phase in which the particle is
unaffected by the periodic potential. For a non-symmorphic lattice, however,
there may be an additional intermediate phase in which the particle is neither
localized nor completely free. The fixed point governing the intermediate phase
is shown to be identical to the well-known multichannel Kondo fixed point in
the Toulouse limit as well as the resonance fixed point of a quantum dot model
and a double-barrier Luttinger liquid model. The mapping allows us to compute
the fixed-poing mobility $\mu^*$ of the quantum Brownian motion model exactly,
using known conformal-field-theory results of the Kondo problem. From the

presence of a constant background of the second-rank antisymmetric tensor field
$B_{ij}$. We extend the operator formulation of Gross and Jevicki in this
situation and construct the overlap vertices explicitly. As a result we find a
noncommutative structure of the Moyal type only in the zero-mode sector, which
is consistent with the result of the correlation functions among vertex
operators in the world sheet formulation. Furthermore we find out a certain
unitary transformation of the string field which absorbs the Moyal type
noncommutative structure. It can be regarded as a microscopic origin of the
transformation between the gauge fields in commutative and noncommutative gauge
theories discussed by Seiberg and Witten.

nuclei and metallic clusters. This theory is based on the application of
semiclassical methods and random matrix theory to linear response of many-body
systems. The theory is developed in the approximation wherein the many-body
system can be treated as a single particle in an effective, time-dependent
mean-field. We find semiclassical expressions for energy dissipation relevant
in one-body dissipation in heavy nuclei. We also show that this energy
dissipation, related to damping of collective excitations, is irreversible. The
irreversibility is proved by our development of a quantum diffusion equation.
It may be noted that the quantum diffusion equation is derived from the von
Neumann equation and makes no assumption about the initial form of the density
operator. It is shown that, in the semiclassical limit, the quantum diffusion
equation reduces to the classical Smoluchowski equation. Further, we show that
the dissipation is a purely quantal phenomenon as it is related to the
geometric phase acquired by a single-particle wavefunction as the system
evolves in a slow-varying mean-field. It is explicitly shown that the
dissipation rate is related to the nature of dynamics and the spectrum of the
classical Liouvillian operator. Finally, we present an expression for the
viscosity tensor encountered in nuclear fission in terms of periodic orbits of
the single particle in an adiabatically deforming nucleus.

construct three phase-equivalent Lambda-N potentials with different central

we perform an extensive calculation of ab initio type for the hypernuclei of up
to A=6. The binding energies and the sizes of the Lambda-hypernuclei are very
insensitive to the type of the phase-equivalent Lambda-N potentials. We use two
different Lambda-Lambda potentials which both reproduce Delta B_{Lambda Lambda}
of 6He_{Lambda Lambda} reasonably well. Any combination of these Lambda-N and
Lambda-Lambda potentials predicts hitherto undiscovered particle-stable bound
states, 4H_{Lambda Lambda}, 5H_{Lambda Lambda} and 5He_{Lambda Lambda}:
Predicted values of B_{Lambda Lambda} are about 0.4, 5.5 and 6.3 MeV,
respectively. The binding energy of 4H_{Lambda Lambda} is so small that its
possibility crucially depends on the strength of the Lambda-Lambda interaction.
The binding energies of both 5He_Lambda and 6He_{Lambda Lambda} are calculated
to be strongly overbound compared to experiment. In relation to this well-known
anomaly we examine the effect of the quark substructure of $N$ and Lambda on
their binding energies. The effect is negligible if the baryon size in which
three quarks are confined is smaller than 0.6 fm, but becomes appreciable,
particularly in 6He_{Lambda Lambda}, if the size is taken to be as large as 0.7
fm. We discuss the extent to which the nucleon subsystem in the hypernuclei
changes by the addition of Lambda particles. The charge symmetry breaking of
the Lambda-N potential is phenomenologically determined and concluded to be
weakly spin-dependent.
