tracks with improved physics has been constructed to reconsider the theoretical
calibration of the dependence of M_v(RR) on metallicity in globular clusters,
and the slope of the mean <M_v(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation. The SHB models confirm
Lee's earlier finding (Lee 1991) that the slope of the <M_v(RR)>-[Fe/H]
relation is itself a function of the metallicity range considered, and that in
addition, for a given [Fe/H], RR Lyrae luminosities depend on HB morphology.
This is due to the fact that HB stars pass through the RR Lyrae instability
strip at different evolutionary stages, depending on their original position on
the HB. At [Fe/H]=-1.9, and for HB type 0, the models yield M_v(RR)=0.47 \pm
0.10. The mean slope for the zero-age HB models is 0.204. Since there is no
simple universal relation between M_v(RR) and metallicity that is applicable to
all globular clusters, the HB morphology of each individual cluster must be
taken into account, in addition to [Fe/H], in deriving the appropriate M_v(RR).
Taking HB morphology into account, we find that the slope of the mean
<M_v(RR)>-[Fe/H] relation varies between 0.36 for the clusters with
galactocentric distances R_gc less than 6 kpc and 0.22 for clusters with
6<R_gc<20 kpc. Implications for interpreting observations of field RR Lyrae

radial light profiles are decomposed, using two generalized exponentials, in
inner and outer components. Each is characterized by the profile shape, central
surface brightness and scale length. We find that light is more centrally
concentrated in Seyfert 1s, that also tend to lie in earlier-type hosts than
Seyfert 2s. Seyfert 1 and 2 bulges have similar shapes but the former are
characterized by larger central surface brightnesses and smaller scale lengths.
The three parameters characterizing the bulge component correlate with each
other, within a limited range of bulge luminosities. Cold galaxies are
disk-dominated systems, with complex morphologies. Their bulges are flatter and
fainter compared to the Warm sample. The disk structural parameters span
similar ranges for the three (sub)samples but with larger scatter. The
parametrization of light profiles, as described in this paper, shows that the

contribute at least 25 per cent of the 850-micron background. We carry out a

called gaussian deconvolution is used. This technique yields a gaussian
diameter which subsequently has to be multiplied with a conversion factor to
obtain the true angular diameter of the source. This conversion factor is a
function of the FWHM of the beam or point spread function and also depends on
the intrinsic surface brightness distribution of the source.
  In this paper conversion factors are presented for a number of simple
geometries: a circular constant surface brightness disk and a spherical
constant emissivity shell, using a range of values for the inner radius. Also
more realistic geometries are studied, based on a spherically symmetric
photo-ionization model of a planetary nebula. This enables a study of optical
depth effects, a comparison between images in various emission lines and the
use of power law density distributions. It is found that the conversion factor
depends quite critically on the intrinsic surface brightness distribution,
which is usually unknown. The uncertainty is particularly large if extended
regions of low surface brightness are present in the nebula. In such cases the
use of gaussian or second moment deconvolution is not recommended.
  As an alternative, a new algorithm is presented which allows the
determination of the intrinsic FWHM of the source using only the observed
surface brightness distribution and the FWHM of the beam. Tests show that this
implicit deconvolution method works well in realistic conditions, even when the
signal-to-noise is low, provided that the beam size is less than roughly 2/3 of
the observed FWHM and the beam profile can be approximated by a gaussian.

accelerate iron cosmic rays to greater than $\sim 10^{20}$ eV. These ions can

ergodicity gets broken, but that thermodynamic properties of the liquid remain
unchanged across the transition if determined as thermodynamic equilibrium

underlying thermodynamic phase transition is responsible for the dramatic
slowdown at the liquid-glass boundary. Such a phase transition (which shows up
in proper equilibrium phase space averages) would trigger the dynamic
standstill, and then get masked by it. A recent Monte Carlo algorithm [7]

We discuss the properties of the spin liquid phase, in particular the nature of

magnetised cosmological perturbations employ FRW backgrounds. However, it is
important, to know the limits of this approximation and the effects one loses
by neglecting the anisotropy of the background magnetic field. We develop a new
treatment, which fully incorporates the anisotropic magnetic effects by
allowing for a Bianchi I background universe. The anisotropy of the unperturbed
model facilitates the closer study of the coupling between magnetism and
geometry. The latter leads to a curvature stress, which accelerates positively
curved perturbed regions and balances the effect of magnetic pressure gradients
on matter condensations. We argue that the tension carried along the magnetic
force-lines is the reason behind these magneto-curvature effects. For a
relatively weak field, we also compare to the results of the almost-FRW
approach. We find that some of the effects identified by the FRW treatment are
in fact direction dependent, where the key direction is that of the background
magnetic field vector. Nevertheless, the FRW-based approach to magnetised
cosmological perturbations remains an accurate approximation, particularly on
large scales, when one looks at the lowest order magnetic impact on
gravitational collapse. On small scales however, the accuracy of the perturbed
Friedmann framework may be compromised by extra shear effects.

increased to some critical value. Various investigations have suggested that a

effective Lagrangian as a guide one observes that a parity doubling is
associated with the appearance of an enhanced global symmetry in the spectrum
of the theory. If such a near-critical theory describes symmetry breaking in
the electroweak theory, the additional symmetry suppresses the contribution of
the parity doubled sector to the S parameter.

not orthogonal. We show that if only contributions of order $1/N_c^2$ are

states are possible, and we present an orthogonalization procedure for these
states. The result is simple and intuitive and could give an estimate of the
possibility to produce color separated gluonic subsystems, if no dynamical
effects are important. We also study with a simple MC the possibility that
configurations which correspond to ""short strings"" are dynamically favored. The
advantage of our approach over more elaborate models is its simplicity, which
makes it easier to estimate color reconnection effects in reactions which are
more complicated than the relatively simple $e^+e^-$ annihilation.

projective space $\P^8$ of $3\times 3$ matrices; this expresses the degree of
the orbit closure in terms of the degrees of suitable loci related to the
limits of the curve. These limits, and the degrees of the corresponding loci,
have been established in previous work.

unitarity constraints and explicit resonance fields. It is based on the most
general structure of any pion-nucleon partial wave amplitude neglecting the
unphysical cuts as derived from the N/D method. This amplitude is then matched
to the one-loop heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory result at third order
and to tree level exchanges of baryon- and meson states in the s,t and u
channels. This generates the left-hand cuts. The unitarization procedure does
not involve form factors or regulator functions. The resonance parameters are
determined from fits to the S- and P-wave pion-nucleon partial wave amplitudes
for energies up to 1.3 GeV. In particular, the $\Delta (1232)$ is accurately
reproduced whereas scalar and vector meson couplings are less precisely pinned
down. We also obtain a satisfactory description of the $\pi$N threshold
parameters. Further extensions of this method to coupled channels and the
three-flavor case are briefly discussed.

states in a finite energy window and thermodynamical observables free energy,
average energy, entropy and specific heat in a finite temperature window.
Comparing the results of the Monte Carlo Hamiltonian with standard Lagrangian
lattice calculations, we find good agreement. However, the Monte Carlo
Hamiltonian results show less fluctuations under variation of temperature.

writing features of a size lambda/2 or greater, where lambda is the optical
wavelength. Using nonclassical photon number states, entangled N at a time, we
show that it is possible to write features of minimum size lambda/(2N) in an
N-photon absorbing substrate. This result surpasses the usual classical
diffraction limit by a factor of N. Since the number of features that can be
etched on a two-dimensional surface scales inversely as the square of the
feature size, this allows one to write a factor of N^2 more elements on a
semiconductor chip. A factor of N = 2 can be achieved easily with entangled
photon pairs generated from optical parametric downconversion. It is shown how
to write arbitrary 2D patterns by using this method.
