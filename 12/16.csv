between dictatorship associations, where groups of agents rely on one of them
to make decision, and democratic associations, where each agent takes part in
the group decision. In the dictatorship model, agents segregate into two
distinct populations, while the democratic model is driven towards a critical
state where groups of agents of all sizes exist. Hence, both models display a
level of organization, but only the democratic model is self-organized. We show
that the dictatorship model generates less volatile markets than the democratic

the form of a Poynting jet. We show that an MHD-instability driven dynamo (IDD)
operating in a hot accretion disk is capable of generating energetically
adecuate magnetic flux deposition rates above and below a mildly advective
accretion disk structure. The dynamo is driven by the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) of a toroidal field in a shear flow and is limited by the
buoyancy of `horizontal' flux and by reconnection in the turbulent medium. In
the comoving frame of a semi-thick, slim disk setting, the predominant field
components reside in surfaces perpendicular to the local meridian and the flux
is deposited in funnels that are relatively free of baryons. The efficiency of
magnetic energy deposition is estimated to be comparable to the neutrino losses
but the strong effective shear induced by the metric on the MRI favors pumping
magnetic field energy at low wavenumbers, i.e., field generation at large
coherence lengthscales. This, in turn, suggests that an MHD collimation
mechanism may deem this process a more viable alternative to
neutrino-burst--driven models of gamma ray bursts.

Variable) quasars put strong constraints on the electron - positron pair
content of radio-loud quasar jets. From those observations, we infer that jets
in quasars contain many more electron - positron pairs than protons, but
dynamically are still dominated by protons. In particular, we show that pure
electron - positron jet models can be excluded, as they overpredict soft X-ray
radiation; likewise, pure proton - electron jets can be excluded, as they
predict too weak nonthermal X-ray radiation. An intermediate case is viable. We
demonstrate that jets which are initially proton-electron (""proto-jets"") can be
pair-loaded via interaction with 100 - 300 keV photons produced in hot
accretion disc coronae, likely to exist in active galactic nuclei in general.
If the coronal radiation is powered by magnetic flares, the pair loading is
expected to be non-uniform and non-axisymmetric. Together with radiation drag,
this leads to velocity and density perturbations in a jet and formation of
shocks, where the pairs are accelerated. Such a scenario can explain rapid

solving problems related to the evolution of large-scale structure, galaxy
clusters, and individual galaxies. The code, named COSMOS, possesses several
new features which distinguish it from other PM-PPM codes. In particular, to
solve the Poisson equation we have written a new multigrid solver which can
determine the gravitational potential of isolated matter distributions and
which properly takes into account the finite-volume discretization required by
PPM. All components of the code are constructed to work with a nonuniform mesh,
preserving second-order spatial differences. The PPM code uses vacuum boundary
conditions for isolated problems, preventing inflows when appropriate. The PM
code uses a second-order variable-timestep time integration scheme. Radiative
cooling and cosmological expansion terms are included. COSMOS has been
implemented for parallel computers using the Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM)
library, and it features a modular design which simplifies the addition of new
physics and the configuration of the code for different types of problems. We
discuss the equations solved by COSMOS and describe the algorithms used, with
emphasis on these features. We also discuss the results of tests we have
performed to establish that COSMOS works and to determine its range of
validity.

continuum images reveal a highly elongated galaxy with a dust lane crossing the
nucleus. The surface brightness profile is best fitted by a bulge plus
exponential disk model, favoring classification as a highly inclined spiral
galaxy (i=70 degree). The color map confirms the dust lane aligned with the
galaxy major axis and crossing the putative nucleus. The Halpha+[NII] map
exhibits a gaseous, jet-like structure perpendicular to the nuclear dust lane
and the galaxy major axis. The radio map shows compact, steep spectrum emission
which is elongated in the same direction as the Halpha+[NII] emission. By
analogy with Seyfert galaxies, we therefore suspect this alignment reflects an
interaction between the radio jet and the ISM. The axes of the nuclear dust
disk, the radio emission, and the optical line emission apparently define the
axis of the AGN. The observations suggest that in this galaxy the nuclear
accretion disk, obscuring torus, and large scale molecular gas layer are
roughly coplanar. Our classification of the host galaxy strengthens the trend
for megamasers to be found preferentially in highly inclined spiral galaxies.

A, makes it possible to improve the abundance accuracy by studying more lines
and to discuss several elements not included in the work of Edvardsson et al.
The present paper provides the data and discusses some general results of the

-0.6 having a small mean Galactocentric distance in the stellar orbits, Rm < 7
kpc, are shown to be older than the other disk stars and probably belong to the
thick disk. Excluding these stars, a slight decreasing trend of [Fe/H] with
increasing Rm and age is found, but a large scatter in [Fe/H] (up to 0.5 dex)
is present at a given age and Rm. The derived trends of O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Ni

implies the existence of deviations of an averaged model from the standard
Friedmann-Lemaitre cosmologies. We quantify these deviations, encoded in a
backreaction parameter, in the framework of Newtonian cosmology. We employ the
linear theory of gravitational instability in the Eulerian and Lagrangian
approaches, as well as the spherically- and plane-symmetric solutions as
standards of reference. We propose a model for the evolution of the average
characteristics of a spatial domain for generic initial conditions that
contains the spherical top-hat model and the planar collapse model as exact sub
cases. A central result is that the backreaction term itself, calculated on
sufficiently large domains, is small but, still, its presence can drive the
cosmological parameters on the averaging domain far away from their global
values of the standard model. We quantify the variations of these parameters in
terms of the fluctuations in the initial data as derived from the power
spectrum of initial cold dark matter density fluctuations. E.g. in a domain
with a radius of 100Mpc today and initially one-sigma fluctuations, the density
parameters deviate from their homogeneous values by 15%; three-sigma
fluctuations lead to deviations larger than 100%.

to a photon index of Gamma=1.0+-0.35.
  We therefore, attempt to model the X-ray data with a ""scatterer"" model in
which the intrinsic X-ray emission along our line of sight is obscured by an
absorbing screen while some fraction, f, is scattered into our line of sight by
an ionized medium; this is the standard model for the X-ray emission in
obscured (but non Compton-thick)
  Seyfert galaxies. We obtain an absorbing column of 2x10^{23}cm^{-2} for a
power-law photon index of Gamma=1.9, an order of magnitude above the column
estimated on the basis of optical observations; the percentage of the scattered
emission is high (~20%). Alternatively, a model where most of the X-ray
emission comes from reflection on a Compton thick torus (N_H>10^{24} cm^{-2})
cannot be ruled out.
  We do not detect an Fe line at 6.4 keV; however, the upper limit (90%) to the

the following states continuously appear; (i) Kondo singlet state of each dot
with its adjacent-site lead, (ii) singlet state between the local spins on the
dots, and (iii) double occupancy in the bonding orbital of the two dots. The
conductance shows peaks at the transition regions between these states.
Especially, the peak at the boundary between (i) and (ii) has the unitarity
limit value of $2e^{2}/h$ because of coherent connection through the
lead-dot-dot-lead. For the strongly correlated cases, the characteristic energy
scale of the coherent peak shows anomalous decrease relating to the quantum
critical transition known for the two-impurity Kondo effect. The two dots
systems give the new realization of the two-impurity Kondo problem.

the parameters of both theories are related in a given way. We will show that

Then we will study scalar fields. There are two quantum theories for the scalar
field in AdS space. The usual prescription of the AdS/CFT correspondence which
takes Dirichlet boundary conditions at the border corresponds to one of the
quantum theories. We will show that changing boundary conditions will allow us
to get the other quantum theory. Finally we consider an Abelian gauge theory in
AdS. We will show that the corresponding CFT is independent of the gauge choice

cardinality of a maximum stable set in G. A graph is called $\alpha $-stable if
its stability number remains the same upon both the deletion and the addition
of any edge. We show that a connected bipartite graph has exactly two maximum
stable sets that partition its vertex set if and only if its reduced adjacency
matrix is fully indecomposable. We also describe a decomposition structure of
$\alpha $-stable bipartite graphs in terms of their reduced adjacency matrices.
On the base of these findings we obtain both new proofs for a number of
well-known theorems on the structure of matrices due to Brualdi, Marcus and
Minc, Dulmage and Mendelsohn, and some generalizations of these statements.
Several new results on $\alpha $-stable bipartite graphs and their

matrix product are also considered (namely, Boolean product and Kronecker
product), and their corresponding graph operations. As a consequence, we obtain
a strengthening of one Lewin's theorem claiming that the product of two fully

weak neutral amplitudes, and the $Z^0$ of the Standard Model couples primarily
to neutrons at low $Q^2$. The data can be interpreted with as much confidence
as electromagnetic scattering. After briefly reviewing the present theoretical
and experimental knowledge of neutron densities, we discuss possible parity
violation measurements, their theoretical interpretation, and applications. The
experiments are feasible at existing facilities. We show that theoretical
corrections are either small or well understood, which makes the interpretation
clean. The quantitative relationship to atomic parity nonconservation
observables is examined, and we show that the electron scattering asymmetries
can be directly applied to atomic PNC because the observables have
approximately the same dependence on nuclear shape.

  et.al. (1999) 150",,,"physics.atom-ph",,"  Stabilization is still a somewhat controversial issue concerning its very
existence and also the precise conditions for its occurrence. The key quantity
to settle these questions is the ionization probability, for which hitherto no
computational method exists which is entirely agreed upon. It is therefore very
useful to provide various consistency criteria which have to be satisfied by
this quantity, whose discussion is the main objective of this contribution. We
show how the scaling behaviour of the space leads to a symmetry in the
ionization probability, which can be exploited in the mentioned sense.
Furthermore, we discuss how upper and lower bounds may be used for the same
purpose. Rather than concentrating on particular analytical expressions we
obtained elsewhere for these bounds, we focus in our discussion on the general
principles of this method. We illustrate the precise working of this procedure,
its advantages, shortcomings and range of applicability. We show that besides
constraining possible values for the ionization probability these bounds, like
the scaling behaviour, also lead to definite statements concerning the physical
outcome. The pulse shape properties which have to be satitisfied for the
existence of asymptotical stabilization is the vanishing of the total classical
momentum transfer and the total classical displacement and not smoothly
switched on and off pulses. Alternatively we support our results by general
considerations in the Gordon-Volkov perturbation theory and explicit studies of
various pulse shapes and potentials including in particular the Coulomb- and
the delta potential.

shifts $\eta_+(\pm E_k)$ [$\eta_-(\pm E_k)$] of scattering states with the same
parity at zero momentum as follows: $$\eta_\pm(\mu)+\eta_\pm(-\mu)\pm{\pi\over

Hermitian limit. In contrast, all their energies prove real and
shift-independent. In this sense the lost Hermiticity of our family of
Hamiltonians seems replaced by their accidental PT symmetry.
