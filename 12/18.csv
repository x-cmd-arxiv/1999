(SZE) will yield valuable information on both cosmology and evolution of the
intra-cluster medium (ICM). The redshift distribution of detected clusters will
constrain cosmology, while the properties of the discovered clusters will be
important for studies of the ICM and galaxy formation. Estimating survey yields
requires a detailed model for both cluster properties and the survey strategy.
We address this by making mock observations of galaxy clusters in cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. The mock observatory consists of an interferometric
array of ten 2.5 m diameter telescopes, operating at a central frequency of 30
GHz with a bandwidth of 8 GHz. We find that clusters with a mass above $2.5
\times 10^{14} h_{50}^{-1} M_\odot$ will be detected at any redshift, with the
exact limit showing a very modest redshift dependence. Using a Press-Schechter
prescription for evolving the number densities of clusters with redshift, we
determine that such a survey should find hundreds of galaxy clusters per year,
many at high redshifts and relatively low mass -- an important regime uniquely
accessible to SZE surveys. Currently favored cosmological models predict
roughly 25 clusters per square degree.

well evolved; they display de Vaucouleurs surface brightness profiles, and I
demonstrate that their HST-derived morphological parameters place them on the

our background subtraction routine produces the correct overall zero point, as
judged by the small residual flux levels in the centers of strongly-saturated
interstellar absorption lines. Although there are multiple sources of
background light in STIS echelle mode data, this simple approach works very
well for wavelengths longward of Lyman-alpha. At shorter wavelengths, the
smaller order separation and generally lower signal-to-noise ratios of the data
can reduce the effectiveness of our background estimation procedure. Slight
artifacts in the background-subtracted spectrum can be seen in some cases,
particularly at wavelengths <1300 Ang. Most of these are caused by echelle
scattering of strong spectral features into the inter-order light. We discuss
the limitations of high-resolution STIS data in light of the uncertainties

strongly suggestive that these are the red and blue shifted wings of an iron

bright than in the calculated profiles of disk lines near a black hole subject

good fits are obtained. This gives a restframe energy of the disk line between
6.4 and 6.8 keV indicating that the line is iron K_alpha emission probably of
significantly ionized material. The Laor model shows that the line originates
in a region of the accretion disk extending from ~10 Schwarzschild radii from

astrophysical observations of circumstellar disks which trace their evolving
properties. Accretion disks that are massive enough to produce a solar system
like our own are typically larger than 100 AU. This suggests that the chemistry
of a large fraction of the infalling material is not radically altered upon
contact with a vigorous accretion shock. The mechanisms of accretion onto the
star and eventual dispersal are not yet well understood, but timescales for the
removal of gas and optically thick dust appear to be a few times 10$^6$ yrs. At
later times, tenuous ``debris disks'' of dust remain around stars as old as a
few times 10$^8$ yrs. Features in the morphology of the latter, such as inner
holes, warps, and azimuthal asymmetries, are likely to be the result of the
dynamical influence of large planetary bodies. Future observations will
enlighten our understanding of chemical evolution and will focus on the search
for disks in transition from a viscous accretion stage to one represented by a
gas-free assemblage of colliding planetesimals. In the near future, comparative
analysis of circumstellar dust and gas properties within a statistically

The relative fluxes of the emission lines we have detected in the blue together

(1998, ApJ, 492, L111) indicate that the gas at the nucleus is photoionized by
a nonstellar process, instead of hot stars. Stellar absorption features from
cool stars at the nucleus are very weak. We update the spectral energy
distribution of the nuclear point source and find that although it is roughly
flat in most bands, the optical to UV continuum is very red, similar to the
spectral energy distribution of BL Lac. Thus, the nuclear point source seen in
high-resolution optical images (Bower et al. 1997, ApJ, 483, L33) is not a star
cluster but is instead a nonstellar source. Assuming isotropic emission from
this source, we estimate that the ratio of bolometric luminosity to Eddington
luminosity is 5 X 10^(-7). However, this could be underestimated if this source
is a misaligned BL Lac object, which is a possibility suggested by the spectral
energy distribution and the evidence of optical variability we describe.

common-envelope evolution is avoided if radiation pressure is able to expel
most of a super-Eddington accretion flow from a region smaller than the

largely radiative donors with masses in the range 4-12 solar masses. For donors
more massive than about 5 solar masses, moderate mass ratios q = M_2/M_1 > 1

are much larger than the likely mass-loss rate in the precessing jets. Almost
all of the transferred mass is expelled at radii considerably larger than the

star-formation activities of dwarf irregular galaxies (dIrrs) by considering
two processes: the heating from stellar feedback and the cooling of the heated
gas. After examining the timescales of the two processes, we propose that
continuous global star-formation activity is difficult in dIrrs, since their
small sizes make the feedback efficient and their small metallicities prevent
the cooling from becoming effective. Thus, the intermittent nature of the
star-formation activities of dIrrs, which is due to the small metallicity as
well as the small size, is predicted. We emphasize that the size of a galaxy is
an important factor concerning star-formation activity. The intermittence of
the star-formation activity is also supported by the observed scatter of the
UBV colors and H$\alpha$ equivalent widths of the dIrr sample. However, we note
that efficient interstellar mixing may make the cooling time much shorter.

toward the anticenter were inconsistent with the assumption of a long-lived
warp (Nature 392, 471), showing negative systematic motions as opposed to the
expected positive motions. Using a larger sample of OB stars, improved
distances, and a more accurate model for the uncertainties, we confirm our
previous result for a larger range of galactocentric radii. However, we note
that the new model for errors in the photometric distances reveal an important
bias that causes the observed systematic vertical motions to be smaller than
their true values. Using synthetic catalogues we investigate the effect of this
bias on the systematic vertical motions in conjunction with the possibility of
a smaller warp amplitude and a warp precession rate, both of which can also
lead to smaller systematic motions. Taken together these three effects can work
to produce negative observed systematic vertical motions, similar to those
detected in the data, though only with both excessively high precession rates
(-25 km/sec/kpc) and very large photometric errors (1 magnitude).

calculated analytically in the framework of the Debye-Huckel model and compared
with the respective ones of Salpeter's weak screening approximation. In typical
solar conditions, the deviation from Salpeter's screening factor is less than
one percent, while for hotter stars such corrections turn out to be of the
order of one percent only over the limits of the Debye-Huckel model. Moreover,
an investigation of the impact of the derived non-linear screening effects on
the solar neutrino fluxes yields insignificant corrections for both the pp and
CNO chain reactions.

C63 (2001) 017603","10.1103/PhysRevC.63.017603",,"nucl-th",,"  The kaon energy in neutron matter is calculated analytically with the
Klein-Gordon equation, by making a Wigner-Seitz cell approximation and
employing a $K^-N$ square well potential. The transition from the low density
Lenz potential, proportional to scattering length, to the high density Hartree
potential is found to begin at fairly low densities. Exact non-relativistic
calculations of the kaon energy in a simple cubic crystal of neutrons are used
to test the Wigner-Seitz and the Ericson-Ericson approximation methods. All the
calculations indicate that by $\sim 4$ times nuclear matter density the Hartree
limit is reached, and as the Hartree potential is less attractive, the density
for kaon condensation appears to higher than previously estimated. Effects of a
hypothetical repulsive core in the $K^-N$ potential are also studied.

teaching, is not only the discussion of both modern problems and problems which
solution is an urgent matter. It means that the picture of an active and alive
science should be transmitted to the students, mainly to the College students.
A central point in this matter is the issue which characterizes the Fundamental
Laws of Nature. In this work we emphasize that this sort of laws may exist in
areas which are different from those usually considered. In this type of
discussion it is neither possible nor desirable to avoid the historical
perspective of the scientific development.

morphogenetic process known as convergent extension can be understood as a
energy minimization process, provided the cell-cell adhesive energy has a
certain kind of anisotropy. This single simple property is sufficient cause for
the type of cell elongation, alignment, and intercalation of a cellular array
that is the characteristic of convergent extension. We describe the type of
anisotropy required. We show that the final aspect ratio of the array of cells
is independent of the initial configuration and of the degree of cell
elongation. We find how it depends on the anisotropy.
