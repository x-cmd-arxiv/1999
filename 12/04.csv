gravitational corrections to the Boltzmann equations. These may be important
for the study of CMB temperature anisotropies, particularly their
interpretation. These terms are not included in the canonical treatment as they
arise from the exact equations. Here a weakly nonlinear investigation of these
effects is defined and investigated with an emphasis on a Rees-Sciama sourced
effect -- the imprint of structure evolution on the CMB. It is shown that
gravitational nonlinearity in the weakly nonlinear extension of almost-FLRW
temperature anisotropies leads to cancellation on small-scales when threading
in the Newtonian frame. In the general frame this cancellation does not occur.
In the context of a flat almost-FLRW CDM model I provide a heuristic argument
for a nonperturbative small scale correction, due to the Rees-Sciama effect, of
not more than $\Delta T/T \sim 10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ near $\ell \sim 100 - 300$. The
effect of mild gravitational nonlinearity could be more sophisticated than

underlying mass distribution, using cosmological $N$-body simulations in which
galaxies are modelled via semi-analytic recipes. The nonlinear, stochastic
biasing is quantified in terms of the mean biasing function and the scatter
about it as a function of time, scale and object properties. The biasing of
galaxies and halos shows a general similarity and a characteristic shape, with
no galaxies in deep voids and a steep slope in moderately underdense regions.
At $\sim 8\hmpc$, the nonlinearity is typically $\lsim 10$ percent and the
stochasticity is a few tens of percent, corresponding to $\sim 30$ percent
variations in the cosmological parameter $\beta=\Omega^{0.6}/b$. Biasing
depends weakly on halo mass, galaxy luminosity, and scale. The time evolution
is rapid, with the mean biasing larger by a factor of a few at $z\sim 3$
compared to $z=0$, and with a minimum for the nonlinearity and stochasticity at
an intermediate redshift. Biasing today is a weak function of the cosmological
model, reflecting the weak dependence on the power-spectrum shape, but the time
evolution is more cosmology-dependent, relecting the effect of the growth rate.
We provide predictions for the relative biasing of galaxies of different type
and color, to be compared with upcoming large redshift surveys. Analytic models
in which the number of objects is conserved underestimate the evolution of
biasing, while models that explicitly account for merging provide a good
description of the biasing of halos and its evolution, suggesting that merging
is a crucial element in the evolution of biasing.

high-latitude translucent molecular clouds (HLCs). We report new observations
of the J = (4-3), (2-1), and (1-0) transitions of CO towards eight
high-latitude clouds. The new observations are combined with data from the
literature to show that the emission from all observed CO transitions is
linearly correlated. This implies that the excitation conditions which lead to
emission in these transitions are uniform throughout the clouds. Observed
13CO/12CO (1-0) integrated intensity ratios are generally much greater than the
expected abundance ratio of the two species, indicating that the regions which
emit 12CO (1-0) radiation are optically thick. We develop a statistical method
to compare the observed line ratios with models of CO excitation and radiative
transfer. This enables us to determine the most likely portion of the physical
parameter space which is compatible with the observations. The model enables us
to rule out CO gas temperatures greater than 30K since the most likely
high-temperature configurations are 1 pc-sized structures aligned along the
line of sight. The most probable solution is a high density and low temperature
(HDLT) solution. The CO cell size is approximately 0.01 pc (2000 AU). These
cells are thus tiny fragments within the 100 times larger CO-emitting extent of
a typical high-latitude cloud. We discuss the physical implications of HDLT
cells, and we suggest ways to test for their existence.

proposed by Zharkov and Blinkov for the involutive analysis of polynomial
ideals. It is based on a new concept of involutive monomial division which is
defined for a monomial set. Such a division provides for each monomial the
self-consistent separation of the whole set of variables into two disjoint
subsets. They are called multiplicative and non-multiplicative. Given an
admissible ordering, this separation is applied to polynomials in terms of
their leading monomials. As special cases of the separation we consider those
introduced by Janet, Thomas and Pommaret for the purpose of algebraic analysis
of partial differential equations. Given involutive division, we define an
involutive reduction and an involutive normal form. Then we introduce, in terms
of the latter, the concept of involutivity for polynomial systems. We prove
that an involutive system is a special, generally redundant, form of a Groebner
basis. An algorithm for construction of involutive bases is proposed. It is
shown that involutive divisions satisfying certain conditions, for example,
those of Janet and Thomas, provide an algorithmic construction of an involutive
basis for any polynomial ideal. Some optimization in computation of involutive
bases is also analyzed. In particular, we incorporate Buchberger's chain
criterion to avoid unnecessary reductions. The implementation for Pommaret
division has been done in Reduce.

"math/9912028","Marcos Jardim","Marcos Jardim","Nahm transform of doubly-periodic instantons","PhD thesis, University of Oxford 1999. 110 pages",,,,"math.DG math-ph math.MP",,"  This work concerns the study of certain finite-energy solutions of the
anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations on Euclidean 4-dimensional space which are
periodic in two directions, so-called doubly-periodic instantons. We establish
a circle of ideas involving equivalent analytical and algebraic-geometric
descriptions of these objects.
  In the first introductory chapter we provide an overview of the problem and
state the main results to be proven in the thesis.
  In chapter 2, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the connections we are
concerned with, and show that the coupled Dirac operator is Fredholm.
  After laying these foundations, we are ready to address the main topic of the
thesis, the construction of a Nahm transform of doubly-periodic instantons. By
combining differential-geometric and holomorphic methods, we show in chapters 3
through 5 that doubly-periodic instantons correspond bijectively to certain
singular Higgs pairs, i.e. meromorphic solutions of Hitchin's equations defined
over an elliptic curve.
  The circle of ideas is finally closed in chapter 8. We start by presenting a
construction due to Friedman, Morgan and Witten that associates to each
doubly-periodic instanton a spectral pair consisting of a Riemann surface plus
a line bundle over it. On the other hand, it was shown by Hitchin that Higgs
pairs are equivalent to a similar set of data. We show that the Friedman,
Morgan and Witten spectral pair associated with a doubly-periodic instanton
coincides with the Hitchin spectral pair associated with its Nahm transform.

using an isobaric model based on effective Lagrangians and by taking a cross
symmetry into account. Both {\it pseudovector} and {\it pseudoscalar} couplings
for kaon-baryon-baryon (baryon spin=1/2) interactions are considered with form
factors. A vector meson($K^*(890)$), an axial vector meson($K_1(1270)$),
nucleon resonances($J\le5/2$), and hyperon resonances($J\le3/2$) are treated as
participating particles. By determining unknown coupling constants through a
systematic fitting of the differential cross section, the total cross section,
the single polarization observable, and the radiative kaon capture branching
ratio to their experimental data, we find out a simple model which reproduces
all the experimental data well.

presence of electromagnetic fields is proposed here. We avail of Gordon's
general relativistic derivation of Abraham's electromagnetic energy tensor as
starting point. The necessary description of the elastic and of the inertial
behaviour of matter is provided through a four dimensional generalisation of
Hooke's law, made possible by the introduction of a four dimensional
``displacement'' vector. As intimated by Nordstroem, the physical origin of
electrostriction and of magnetostriction is attributed to the change in the
constitutive equation of electromagnetism caused by the deformation of matter.
The part of the electromagnetic Lagrangian that depends on that deformation is
given explicitly for the case of an isotropic medium and the resulting
expression of the electrostrictive force is derived, thus showing how more
realistic equations of motion for matter subjected to electromagnetic fields
can be constructed.

Changing conditions such as temperature variations and/or alterations in the
environment's resource composition lead to both non-constant replication and
decay rates of the molecules. In general, therefore, molecular evolution takes
place in a dynamic rather than a static fitness landscape. We incorporate
dynamic replication and decay rates into the standard quasispecies theory of
molecular evolution, and show that for periodic time-dependencies, a system of
evolving molecules enters a limit cycle for $t\to\infty$. For fast periodic
changes, we show that molecules adapt to the time-averaged fitness landscape,
whereas for slow changes they track the variations in the landscape arbitrarily
closely. We derive a general approximation method that allows us to calculate
the attractor of time-periodic landscapes, and demonstrate using several
examples that the results of the approximation and the limiting cases of very
slow and very fast changes are in perfect agreement. We also discuss landscapes
with arbitrary time dependencies, and show that very fast changes again lead to
a system that adapts to the time-averaged landscape. Finally, we analyze the
dynamics of a finite population of molecules in a dynamic landscape, and
discuss its relation to the infinite population limit.
