emerging features which are not easy to guess from the elementary interactions
of their microscopic individual components. In the past, the macroscopic
behavior of such systems was modeled by assuming that the collective dynamics
of microscopic components can be effectively described collectively by
equations acting on spatially continuous density distributions. It turns out
that quite contrary, taking into account the actual individual/discrete
character of the microscopic components of these systems is crucial for
explaining their macroscopic behavior. In fact, we find that in conditions in
which the continuum approach would predict the extinction of all the population
(respectively the vanishing of the invested capital or of the concentration of
a chemical substance, etc), the microscopic granularity insures the emergence
of macroscopic localized sub-populations with collective adaptive properties
which allow their survival and development. In particular it is found that in 2
dimensions ""life"" (the localized proliferating phase) always prevails.

cosmic dark matter with a small primordial velocity dispersion preserves the

improves the agreement with halo structure. A ``phase density'' $Q$,
proportional to the inverse entropy for nonrelativistic matter, is estimated
for relativistically decoupled thermal or degenerate relic particles of mass
$m_X$, with a numerical factor depending on the particle type but no
cosmological parameters. Since $Q$ cannot increase for dissipationless,
collisionless matter, at a given velocity dispersion there is a maximum space
density; this ``phase packing'' constraint eliminates the singular density
predicted by CDM. The core radius and halo circular velocity scale analogously
to degenerate dwarf stars. Particle velocities also filter primordial
perturbations on a scale depending on $Q$ and on details of particle
distributions. Particle candidates for warm matter are briefly discussed; for

  We examined the evolution of 12 types of X-ray sources in close binary

of the IMF -- slopes: $\alpha=1$, $\alpha=1.35$ and $\alpha=2.35$ and upper
mass limits, $M_{up}$: 120 $M_{\odot}$, 60 $M_{\odot}$ and 40 $M_{\odot}$.
Results, especially for sources with black holes, are very sensitive to

parameters of starformation bursts.
  Results are applied to several regions of recent starformation in different

total masses of starformation bursts (Shaerer at al., 1998) we calculate
expected numbers of X-ray sources in close binaries for different parameters of

The maximum frequency deviation of 310 $\mu$Hz on 12 May appears to be an

recently reported from several clusters of galaxies, suggests that the amount
of relativistic electrons in the intracluster medium is highly significant,
W_e>10^{61} erg. Considering Coma as the prototype galaxy cluster of nonthermal
radiation, we discuss implications of the inverse Compton origin of the excess
EUV fluxes in the case of low intracluster magnetic fields of order 0.1 muG, as
required for the IC interpretation of the observed excess hard X-ray flux, and
in the case of high fields of order 1 muG as suggested by Faraday rotation
measurements. Although for such high intracluster fields the excess hard X-rays
will require an explanation other than by the IC effect, we show that the
excess EUV flux can be explained by the IC emission of a `relic' population of
electrons driven into the incipient intracluster medium at the epoch of
starburst activity by galactic winds, and later on reenergized by adiabatic
compression and/or large-scale shocks transmitted through the cluster as the
consequence of more recent merger events. For high magnetic fields B > 1 muG
the interpretation of the radio fluxes of Coma requires a second population of
electrons injected recently. They can be explained as secondaries produced by a
population of relativistic protons. We calculate the fluxes of gamma-rays to be
expected in both the low and high magnetic field scenarios, and discuss
possibilities to distinguish between these two principal options by future
gamma-ray observations.

quantitatively the effect of dark matter self interactions on formation of

keeping the essential physics. We confirm that strongly self-interacting dark

that for a range of different interaction strengths, the dark matter halos are

different species are involved. We propose this observational test for 10 DIBs

correlate, and sometimes the correlation is very poor. Only one example of a
strict correlation has been found in our sample between the DIBs at 6614 and

mean-field theory and Luttinger liquid theory techniques are employed for the
case of a null Zeeman energy splitting. The first calculation yields a stable
spin-density wave state along the bar, while the second one predicts dominant
Wigner-crystal correlations along the edges of the bar. We propose an
antiferromagnetic Wigner-crystal groundstate for the edge electrons that
reconciles the two results. A net Zeeman splitting is found to produce canting

main schools of though. One is based upon the idea that view the pseudogap as
deriving from some of precursor superconductivity. Another assumes that
associate the pseudogap phenomena with magnetic pairing of some sort. Both the
scenario of superconducting fluctuation and the scenario of magnetic pairing of
some sort on the pseudogap in underdoped cuprate are based upon the idea that a
fluctuation of a certain type exists at temperatures higher than the usual
superconducting transition temperature and has an effect on the single particl
self-energy and just such a self-energy leads to the gap-like structure of the
spectral weight. In this paper we argue that although a fluctuation of a
certain type has an effect on the origin of the pseudogap, it is not the
crucial factor of the origin of the pseudogap in underdoped cuprate. We
analysis the scenario of the pseudogap in the underdoped cuprate based on the
model that can bring about the spin density wave (SDW) and find the new
dispersion characteristics of the high temperature cuprate superconductors
(excepting two different saddle points located at ($\pm\pi$, 0) and (0,
$\pm\pi$)) and suggest that the pseudogap formation might been due to the
unique interior of the underdoped cuprate.

the numerical result. We calculate, by the use of the density matrix
renormalization group method, the ground state magnetization curve for the case

considering the warped fifth dimension compactified on $S^{1}/Z_{2}$. Many
studies in the context have assumed a particular choice for an integration
constant $\sigma_{0}$ that appears when one solves the five-dimensional
Einstein equation. Since $\sigma_{0}$ is not determined by the boundary
condition of the five-dimensional theory, $\sigma_{0}$ may be regarded as a
gauge degree of freedom in a sense. To this time, all indications are that the
four-dimensional Planck mass depends on $\sigma_{0}$. In this paper, we
carefully investigate the properties of the geometry in the Randall-Sundrum
model, and consider in which location $y$ the four-dimensional Planck mass is
measured. As a result, we find a $\sigma_{0}$-independent relation between the
four-dimensional Planck mass $M_{\rm Pl}$ and five- dimensional fundamental
mass scale $M$, and remarkably enough, we can take $M$ to TeV region when we
consider models with the Standard Model confined on a distant brane. We also
confirm that the physical masses on the distant brane do not depend on
$\sigma_{0}$ by considering a bulk scalar field as an illustrative example. The
resulting mass scale of the Kaluza-Klein modes is on the order of $M$.

  University, USA; 10 pages, 9 figures",,,,"math.CO",,"  A maximum stable set in a graph G is a stable set of maximum cardinality. S
is a local maximum stable set if it is a maximum stable set of the subgraph of

theorem of Nemhauser and Trotter Jr., working as a useful sufficient local
optimality condition for the weighted maximum stable set problem, ensures that
any local maximum stable set of G can be enlarged to a maximum stable set of G.
In this paper we demonstrate that an inverse assertion is true for forests.
Namely, we show that for any non-empty local maximum stable set S of a forest T
there exists a local maximum stable set S1 of T, such that S1 is included in S
and |S1| = |S| - 1. Moreover, as a further strengthening of both the theorem of
Nemhauser and Trotter Jr. and its inverse, we prove that the family of all
local maximum stable sets of a forest forms a greedoid on its vertex set.

  pages 143-179. American Mathematical Society, 2000",,"MSR-TR-99-78","math.PR",,"  In this article we describe a new coupling technique which is useful in a
variety of perfect sampling algorithms. A multishift coupler generates a random
function f() so that for each real x, f(x)-x is governed by the same fixed
probability distribution, such as a normal distribution. We develop the class
of layered multishift couplers, which are simple and have several useful
properties. For the standard normal distribution, for instance, the layered
multishift coupler generates an f() which (surprisingly) maps an interval of
length L to fewer than 2+L/2.35 points --- useful in applications which perform
computations on each such image point. The layered multishift coupler improves
and simplifies algorithms for generating perfectly random samples from several
distributions, including the autogamma distribution, posterior distributions
for Bayesian inference, and the steady state distribution for certain storage
systems. We also use the layered multishift coupler to develop a Markov-chain
based perfect sampling algorithm for the autonormal distribution.
  At the request of the organizers, we begin by giving a primer on CFTP
(coupling from the past); CFTP and Fill's algorithm are the two predominant
techniques for generating perfectly random samples using coupled Markov chains.

category of toric prevarieties in terms of convex-geometrical data, so-called

torus of a toric prevariety X and investigate quotients for such actions. Using
our language of systems of fans, we characterize existence of good prequotients

construction that there always exists a toric prequotient for the action of H
on X, that means an H-invariant toric morphism p from X to a toric prevariety Y
such that every H-invariant toric morphism from X to a toric prevariety factors
through p. Finally, generalizing a result of D. Cox, we prove that every toric
prevariety occurs as the image of a categorical prequotient of an open toric

study a simple model for B-DNA incorporating explicitly its charge pattern as a

onto the molecules depend on the central distance and on the relative
orientation. The contributions of nonlinear screening by monovalent counterions
to these forces and torques are analyzed and calculated for different salt
concentrations. As a result, we find that the sign of the force depends
sensitively on the relative orientation. For intermolecular distances smaller
than $6\AA$ it can be both attractive and repulsive. Furthermore we report a
nonmonotonic behaviour of the effective force for increasing salt
concentration. Both features cannot be described within linear screening
theories. For large distances, on the other hand, the results agree with linear
screening theories provided the charge of the bio-molecules is suitably
renormalized.
