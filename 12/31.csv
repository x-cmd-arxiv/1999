  Accepted for publication in ApJ Letters",,"10.1086/312505",,"astro-ph",,"  We report the discovery of a significant old population in the dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxy Leo I as a result of a wide-area search with the ESO
New Technology Telescope. Studies of the stellar content of Local Group dwarf
galaxies have shown the presence of an old stellar population in almost all of
the dwarf spheroidals. The only exception was Leo I, which alone appeared to
have delayed its initial star formation episode until just a few Gyr ago. The
color-magnitude diagram of Leo I now reveals an extended horizontal branch,
unambiguously indicating the presence of an old, metal-poor population in the
outer regions of this galaxy. Yet we find little evidence for a stellar
population gradient, at least outside R > 2' (0.16 kpc), since the old
horizontal branch stars of Leo I are radially distributed as their more
numerous intermediate-age helium-burning counterparts. The discovery of a
definitely old population in the predominantly young dwarf spheroidal galaxy
Leo I points to a sharply defined first epoch of star formation common to all
of the Local Group dSph's as well as to the halo of the Milky Way.

of supernova rate to isotropic equivalent GRB rate is large: more than 6000
SNIbc per GRB or 30,000 SNII per GRB. GRBs could arise in a large fraction of
black hole-forming events only with collimation in the range 0.01 - 0.001 and a
steep enough slope of the IMF; 2) GRBs cannot account for the majority of large
HI holes observed in galaxies; 3) the probability that the solar system was
exposed to a fluence large enough to melt the chondrules during the first 10^7
yr of solar system history is negligibly small; 4) Even for very opaque
atmospheres, a significant fraction of the GRB energy is transmitted as UV
lines due to excitation by secondary electrons. For eukaryotic-like organisms
in thin atmospheres (e.g. contemporary Mars), or for UV line exposure in thick

fixed by charging effects, a ``negative gap'' was observed in particles with an
odd number of electrons. This observation has called into question the use of a
grand canonical ensemble in describing superconductivity in such ultrasmall
particles.
  We have studied the effects of fixed electron number and finite size in
nanoscale superconductors, by applying the canonical BCS theory for the
attractive Hubbard model. The ground state energy and the energy gap are
compared with the conventional and parity-projected grand canonical BCS
results, and in one dimension also with the exact solutions by the Bethe
ansatz. The crossover from the bulk to quantum limit is studied for various
regimes of electron density and coupling strength. The effects of boundary
conditions and different lattice structures are also examined.
  A ``negative gap'' for odd electron number emerges most naturally in the
canonical scheme. For even electron number, the gap is particularly large for
``magic numbers'' of electrons for a given system size or of atoms for a fixed
electron density. These features are in accordance with the exact solutions,
but are essentially missed in the grand canonical results.

and exclusive cross sections may be formulated in terms of a universal colour
dipole cross section at small $x$. It is well known that for small transverse
size dipoles this cross section is related to the leading-log gluon density.
Using the measured pion-proton cross section as a guide, we suggest a
reasonable extrapolation of the dipole cross section to the large transverse
size region. We point out that the observed magnitude and small $x$ rise of the
gluon density from conventional fits implies that the DGLAP approximation has a
restricted region of applicability. We found that `higher twist' or unitarity
corrections are required in, or close to, the HERA kinematic region, even for
small `perturbative' dipoles for scattering at central impact parameters. This
means that the usual perturbative leading twist description, for moderate
virtualities, $1 < Q^2 < 10$ GeV$^2$, has rather large `higher twist'
corrections at small $x$. In addition, for these virtualities, we also find
sizeable contributions from large non-perturbative dipoles ($b \gsim 0.4$ fm)
to $F_2$, and also to $F_L$. This also leads to deviations from the standard
leading twist DGLAP results, at small $x$ and moderate $Q^2$. Our model also
describes the low $Q^2$ data very well without any further tuning. We
generalize the Gribov unitarity limit for the structure functions of a hadron
target to account for the blackening of the interaction at central impact
parameters and to include scattering at peripheral impact parameters which
dominate at extremely large energies.

other than the low energy vacuum. In a hot Quark Gluon Plasma $J/\Psi$
particles will melt and not exist as resonant states. $\Upsilon$'s, however,
because of their smaller size and the dominance of the Coulomb potential, will
still form as $Q\bar Q$ bound states but their properties will shift. In
particular the $\Upsilon$ mass may be shifted upward by over 100 MeV. If such
excited states manage to escape from the plasma as a superheated particle, they
may serve as a diagnostic of the plasma in which they originated. We propose
that such a scenario is possible and that hot $\Upsilon$'s will form and
escape, thereby providing us with crucial information about the Quark Gluon
Plasma.

If alpha(G) + mu(G) equals its order, then G is a Koenig-Egervary graph. We
call G an $\alpha $-square-stable graph, shortly square-stable, if alpha(G) =
alpha(G*G), where G*G denotes the second power of G. These graphs were first

some new approach based on formation of the symmetric six-quark bag in the
state $|(0s)^6[6]_X,L=0>$ dressed due to strong coupling to $\pi$, $\sigma$ and
$\rho$ fields are suggested. These new mechanism offers a strong
intermediate-range attraction which replaces the effective $\sigma$-exchange
(or excitation of two isobars in the intermediate state) in traditional force
models. A similar mechanism with vector $\rho$-meson production in the
intermediate six-quark state is expected to lead to a strong short-range
spin-orbital nonlocal interaction in the $NN$ system, which may resolve the
long-standing puzzle of the spin-orbit force in baryons and in two-baryon
systems. Illustrative examples are developed which demonstrate clearly how well
the suggested new model can reproduce $NN$ data. Strong interrelations have
been shown to exist between the proposed microscopic model and the
one-component Moscow $NN$ potential developed by the authors previously and
also with some hybrid models and the one-term separable Tabakin potential. The

of axial current (PCAC), a fact that has especially large consequences at low

with the variational methods, such as that using the Hylleraas-type basis
functions. Numerical comparisons are made to demonstrate them, by calculating
the non-relativistic and infinite-nuclear-mass limit of the ground state energy
of the helium atom. The exponentially convergency of this approach is due to
the full matching between the analytical structure of the basis functions that
I use and the true wave function. This full matching was not reached by almost
any other methods. For example, the variational method using the Hylleraas-type
basis does not reflects the logarithmic singularity of the true wave function
at the origin as predicted by Bartlett and Fock. Two important approaches are
proposed in this work to reach this full matching: the coordinate
transformation method and the asymptotic series method. Besides these, this

integrations in solving the Schr\""{o}dinger equation, without much loss of
