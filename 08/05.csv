temperature information is now available, making it the largest complete sample
of its kind. It is therefore expected to significantly improve the estimation
of the temperature distribution function of moderately hot clusters. We find
that the resulting temperature function is higher than previous estimations,
but agrees well with the temperature distribution function inferred from the
BCS and RASS luminosity function. We have used this sample to constrain the
amplitude of the matter fluctuations on cluster's scale of
$8\sqrt[3]{\Omega_0}^{-1}h^{-1}$Mpc, assuming a mass-temperature relation based
on recent numerical simulations. We find $\sigma_8 = 0.6\pm 0.02$ for an
$\Omega_0 = 1$ model. Our sample provides an ideal reference at $z \sim 0$ to
use in the application of the cosmological test based on the evolution of X-ray
cluster abundance (Oukbir & Blanchard 1992, 1997). Using Henry's sample, we
find that the abundance of clusters at $z = 0.33$ is significantly smaller, by
a factor larger than 2, which shows that the EMSS sample provides strong
evidence for evolution of the cluster abundance. A likelihood analysis leads to
a rather high value of the mean density parameter of the universe: $\Omega

1998S. The SN is found to exhibit a high degree of linear polarization,
implying significant asphericity for its continuum-scattering environment.
Prior to removal of the interstellar polarization, the polarization spectrum is
characterized by a flat continuum (at p ~ 2%) with distinct changes in
polarization associated with both the broad (FWZI >= 20,000 km/s) and narrow
(unresolved, FWHM < 300 km/s) line emission seen in the total flux spectrum.
When analyzed in terms of a polarized continuum with unpolarized broad-line
recombination emission, an intrinsic continuum polarization of p ~ 3% results
(the highest yet found for a SN), suggesting a global asphericity of >= 45%
from the oblate, electron-scattering dominated models of Hoflich (1991). The
smooth, blue continuum evident at early times is shown to be inconsistent with
a reddened, single-temperature blackbody, instead having a color temperature
that increases with decreasing wavelength. Broad emission-line profiles with
distinct blue and red peaks are seen in the total flux spectra at later times,
perhaps suggesting a disk-like or ring-like morphology for the dense (n_e ~

scattering environment for the spectropolarimetry are discussed, as are the

red giant branch is very wide [~1.0 mag in (U-B)_0 and ~0.4 mag in (B-V)_0 and
(V-I)_0], indicating a significant dispersion of stellar metallicities, which
by comparison with the theoretical isochrones and data for Galactic clusters we
estimate to lie between approximately -0.7< [Fe/H] < +0.3. We also discuss the
metallicity dependence of the red clump I-band brightness and we show that it
is between 0.1-0.2 mag dex^{-1}. This agrees well with the previous empirical
determinations and the models of stellar evolution.
  The de-reddened (V-I)_0 color of the red clump in the observed bulge field is
<(V-I)_0> = 1.066, sigma_{(V-I)_0} = 0.14, i.e. 0.056 mag redder than the local
stars with good parallaxes measured by Hipparcos. When we use our data to
re-derive the red clump distance to the Galactic center, we obtain the
Galactocentric distance modulus \mu_{0,GC}=14.69 +- 0.1 mag (R_0=8.67 +- 0.4
kpc), with error dominated by the systematics of photometric calibration. We
then discuss the systematics of the red clump method and how they affect the
red clump distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud. We argue that the value of
distance modulus \mu_{0,LMC}=18.24 +- 0.08 (44.5 +- 1.7 kpc), recently refined
by Udalski, is currently the most secure and robust of all LMC distance
estimates. This has the effect of increasing any LMC-tied Hubble constant by
about 12%, including the recent determinations by the HST Key Project and

(B-V)_0, and (V-I)_0 are very well correlated, indicating that a single
parameter determines the observed spread of their values, reaching almost 2 mag
in the (U-B)_0. It seems most likely that heavy element content is the dominant
parameter, but it is possible that another parameter: the age (or mass) of a
star moves it along the same trajectory in the color--color diagram as the
metallicity. The current ambiguity can be resolved with spectral analysis, and
our catalog may be useful as a finding list of red clump giants. We point out
that these K giants are more suitable for a fair determination of the

clusters which trace out a ~50 pc ring, that defines the inner edge of a cold
gas torus. This reservoir of cold gas has probably been created by gas inflow
from a larger scale bar and deposited at the inner Lindblad resonance. The
family of compact radio sources lie interior to the starburst ring, and in
general do not have optical or IR counterparts. They are mostly SNRs. The radio
nucleus, which is probably an AGN, lies near the centre of the ring. The X-ray
emission from the nuclear source is extended in the ROSAT HRI detector
indicating that not all of the X-ray emission can be associated with the AGN.
The lack of X-ray variability and the flat radio spectrum of the nucleus,
argues against an ultraluminous SN as the dominant energetic source at the
galaxy core. The diffuse emission associated with the outflowing superwind is
present in the central region on a size scale consistent with the idea of

leads to some unusual behavior. It is shown that in the presence of the charge
the polarization separates into `switchable' and `non-switchable' parts. The
electric field, appearing due to the space charge, does not wash out the phase
transition, which remains second order but takes place at somewhat reduced
temperature. At the same time, it leads to a suppression of the
ferroelectricity in a near-electrode layer. This conclusion is valid for
materials with both second and first order phase transitions in pure bulk
samples. Influence of the depletion charge on thermodynamic coercive field
reduces mainly to the lowering of the phase transition temperature, and its
effect is negligible. The depletion charge can, however, facilitate an
appearance of the domain structure which would be detrimental for device
performance (fatigue). We discuss some issues of conceptual character, which
are generally known but were overlooked in previous works. The present results
have general implications for small systems with depletion charge.

a cylinder with specified boundary conditions emphasizing the role of a triplet
of algebras: the Verlinde, graph fusion and Pasquier algebras. We show that
solving Cardy's equation, expressing consistency of a RCFT on a cylinder, is
equivalent to finding integer valued matrix representations of the Verlinde
algebra. These matrices allow us to naturally associate a graph $G$ to each
RCFT such that the conformal boundary conditions are labelled by the nodes of
$G$. This approach is carried to completion for $sl(2)$ theories leading to
complete sets of conformal boundary conditions, their associated cylinder
partition functions and the $A$-$D$-$E$ classification. We also review the
current status for WZW $sl(3)$ theories. Finally, a systematic generalization
of the formalism of Cardy-Lewellen is developed to allow for multiplicities
arising from more general representations of the Verlinde algebra. We obtain
information on the bulk-boundary coefficients and reproduce the relevant
algebraic structures from the sewing constraints.

measured $n$-axis-projected momentum distribution histograms by two-dimensional
angular correlation of the positron-electron annihilation radiation ({\tt
2D-ACAR}) technique, is discussed. The window least squares statistical noise
smoothing filter described in Adam {\sl et al.}, NIM A, {\bf 337} (1993) 188,
is first refined such that the window free radial parameters ({\tt WRP}) are
optimally adapted to the data. In an ideal single crystal, the specific jumps
induced in the {\tt WRP} distribution by the existing Fermi surface jumps yield
straightforward information on the resolved {\tt FSS}. In a real crystal, the
smearing of the derived {\tt WRP} optimal values, which originates from
positron annihilations with electrons at crystal imperfections, is ruled out by
median smoothing of the obtained distribution, over symmetry defined stars of
bins. The analysis of a gigacount {\tt 2D-ACAR} spectrum, measured on the
archetypal high-$T_c$ compound $YBa\sb{2}Cu\sb{3}O\sb{7-\delta}$ at room
temperature, illustrates the method. Both electronic {\tt FSS}, the ridge along
$\Gamma X$ direction and the pillbox centered at the $S$ point of the first
Brillouin zone, are resolved.

  not affect conclusions). Also, discusses some old ideas in greater detail and
  introduces new ones, references added, DREV website: http://www.drev.dnd.ca/",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  An interpretation of quantum mechanics is proposed which augments the
stochastic pilot-wave model, introduced by Nelson [E. Nelson, Phys. Rev., 150,
1079 (1966)], with a dual guidance condition. Namely, in addition to the
stochastic guidance condition which describes how the wave controls the
particle (wave-to-particle guidance condition), we introduce another stochastic
guidance condition describing how the particle guides the wave
(particle-to-wave guidance condition). We therefore introduce an
action-reaction principle in the pilot-wave formulation of quantum mechanics.
The particle-to-wave guidance condition takes the form of spontaneous
transitions of the wavefunction that are Poisson distributed in time. The
wavefunction selected by the transition is influenced by its likelyhood with
respect to the particle position, as well as certain conservation constraints.
It is shown that the stochastic particle-to-wave guidance condition reproduces
certain aspects of the spontaneous localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini and
Weber [G. C. Ghirardi, A. Rimini and T. Weber, Phys. Rev. D, 34, 470 (1986)],
and of Milburn's intrinsic decoherence model [G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. A, 44,
5401 (1991)], while avoiding some of the difficulties associated with them. The
macroscopic limit of the dualist interpretation is analyzed for the case of a
free body. Possible improvements of this interpretation are discussed.

coherent field, can induce anisotropy in the medium and can cause the
polarization of a probe field to rotate. Therefore the rotation of probe
polarization, due to magnetic field alone, can be controlled efficiently with
the use of a coherent control field. We demonstrate this enhancement of the
magneto-optical rotation (MOR) of a linearly polarized light, by doing detailed
calculations on a system with relevant transitions $j=0\leftrightarrow
j=1\leftrightarrow j=0$.
