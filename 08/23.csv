dispersive, and Fourier transform, are viable for imaging the universe in three
dimensions. There are domains of greatest utility for each of these
architectures. The optimum choice among the various alternative architectures
is dependent on the nature of the desired observations, the maturity of the
relevant technology, and the character of the backgrounds. The domain
appropriate for each of the alternatives is delineated; both for instruments
having ideal performance as well as for instrumentation based on currently
available technology. The environment and science objectives for the Next
Generation Space Telescope will be used as a specific representative case to
provide a basis for comparison of the various alternatives.

and the real-space velocity field. The relation accounts for radial character
of redshift distortions, and it is not restricted to the limit of the distant
observer. Direct comparisons between the observed redshift-space density fields
and the real-space velocity fields possess all of the advantages of the
conventional redshift-space analyses, while at the same time they are free of
their disadvantages. In particular, neither the model-dependent reconstruction
of the density field in real space is necessary, nor is the reconstruction of
the nonlinear velocity field in redshift space, questionable because of its
vorticity at second order. The nonlinear redshift-space velocity field is
irrotational only in the distant observer limit, and that limit is not a good
approximation for shallow catalogs of peculiar velocities currently available.
Unlike the conventional redshift-space comparisons, the comparison proposed
here does not have to be restricted to the linear regime. Accounting for
nonlinear effects removes one of the sources of bias in the estimate of beta.
Moreover, the nonlinear effects break the Omega-bias degeneracy plaguing all
analyses based on linear theory.

conformally invariant fractal boundary, like a critical O(N) loop or a $Q$

f(\theta)=\frac{\pi}{\theta} -\frac{25-c}{12}

of the external perimeter and $D_{\rm H}$ of the hull of a Potts cluster obey
the duality equation $(D_{\rm EP}-1)(D_{\rm H}-1)={1/4}$. A related covariant

filtration exhibits all classical concordance invariants, including the
Casson-Gordon invariants. As a first step, we construct an infinite sequence of
new obstructions that vanish on slice knots. These take values in the L-theory
of skew fields associated to certain {\em universal} groups. Finally, we use
the dimension theory of von Neumann algebras to define an L^2 signature and use
this to detect the first unknown step in our obstruction theory.

which produces many contact structures, and tomography, which allows one to
analyse a contact structure given a priori and to create from it a
combinatorial image. The surgery methods are based on a theorem of Y.

theory, developed in parts 2 and 3, draws on notions introduced by the author
