galactic nuclei (AGNs), Markarian 501 (Mrk 501) and Markarian 421 (Mrk 421), by
the Whipple and HEGRA collaborations have stimulated efforts to estimate or
limit the spectral energy density (SED) of extragalactic background light (EBL)
which causes attenuation of TeV photons via pair-production when they travel
cosmological distances. In spite of the lack of any distinct cutoff-like
feature in the spectra of Mrk 501 and Mrk 421 (in the interval 0.26-10 TeV)
which could clearly indicate the presence of such a photon absorption
mechanism, we demonstrate that strong EBL attenuation signal (survival
probability of 10 TeV photon <10^{-2}) may still be present in the spectra of
these AGNs. By estimating the minimal and maximal opacity of the universe to
TeV gamma-ray photons, we calculate the visibility range for current and future
gamma-ray observatories. Finally, we show that the proposed experiments,
VERITAS, HESS, and MAGIC, may even be able to actually measure the EBL SED
because their observations extend to the critical 75-150 GeV regime. In this
transition region a distinct ``knee-like'' feature should exist in the spectra
of blazars, which is invariant with respect to their intrinsic properties. The
change of the spectral index and flux amplitude across this knee, if observed
for several blazars, will provide missing pieces of information needed to
measure EBL in the wavelength range 0.1-30 $\mu$m.

strong emission lines of Ly$\alpha$, \NV, \CIV, \HeII, and \CIII redshifted to

order to put constraints on the lens models as well as to investigate the
intrinsic nature of MG2016+112. The observed line ratios of B and C are
consistent with those expected in the simple photo-ionization models for
narrow-line region of active galactic nuclei (AGN) except for the enhanced \NV\
lines. The line ratios difference of components B and C can be interpreted as a
difference in ionization parameters. This result is consistent with lens model
prediction that C is a fold image of a slightly outer part of the nucleus.
MG2016+112 is known to be very unique among the high-redshift AGN; it is
neither an ordinary broad-line quasar nor a powerful radio galaxy as indicated
by the width and flux ratio of the emission lines. Together with other observed
properties discussed in literature, we argue that MG2016+112 is the highest

1994 May, as part of a multiwavelength campaign from the radio to X-ray bands.
At the beginning of the two-day continuous observation, we detected a large
flare, where the 2-10 keV flux changed by a factor of 2 on a time scale of 3 x
10^4 sec. During the flare, the increase in the hard X-ray flux clearly
preceded that observed in the soft X-rays, the spectral evolution tracking a
`clockwise loop' in the flux versus photon index plane. Ascribing the
energy-dependent variability to differential synchrotron cooling of
relativistic electrons, we estimate the magnetic field B in the emission
region. We tested two different methods of comparing the time series in various
X-ray bands: (i) fitting the light curves to a Gaussian and searching for the
time shift of the peak of the flare, and (ii) calculating the discrete
correlation function. Both methods yielded a consistent solution of B ~ 0.1 G.
We also found that the flare amplitude becomes larger as the photon energy
increases, while the duration of the flare stays roughly constant through the
ASCA energy band (0.7-7.5 keV). In the framework of the time dependent
synchrotron self-Compton model in a homogeneous region, we consider a flare
where the maximum Lorentz factor (Gmax) of the injected electrons increases
uniformly throughout the emission volume. The temporal evolution of spectra as
well as the light curves were reproduced with the physical parameters
self-consistently determined from seven observables. We obtain B ~ 0.1-0.2 G

of D ~ 20-30. We discuss the significance of light travel time effects.

replica symmetry, since the width of the distribution P(q) of overlaps may
converge to a finite value at T=0. The authors used an exact enumeration method
to obtain all ground states for a given RNA sequence. Because of the
exponential growing degeneracy, only sequences up to length L=256 could be

  Here it is shown that, in contrast to the previous results, by going to much
larger sizes as L=2000 the variance coverges towards zero, i.e. P(q) is a

mechanism of heterotic D=4 strings. We argue that these anomalies can in
principle be cancelled by the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism present in
field theories corresponding to D-branes at singularities. Moreover, unlike the
heterotic case, once the U(1) symmetry is broken it may remain as an exact
perturbative global symmetry in the low energy theory. Applying this scheme to
the SUSY SM we find that gauging such a general U(1):1) B and L violating

$\mu$-term is generically supressed. We also study the properties of a U(1)
symmetry whose mixed anomalies with the different SM gauge groups are in the
ratio of the beta function coefficients $\beta_a$. This relation has been shown
to hold in certain orientifold models. In all cases the U(1) remains as a
global symmetry at the orientifold singularity, the SM Higgs can break it at
the electroweak scale, making possible to relate the blowing-up of the

  The above conjecture is proven provided the bihamiltonian structure allows an
antiinvolution of a particular form. This implies the conjecture of
\cite{GelZakh99Web} that on a dense open subset the bihamiltonian structure on

  Case",,,"math.DG",,"  A flat complex vector bundle (E,D) on a compact Riemannian manifold (X,g) is
stable (resp. polystable) in the sense of Corlette [C] if it has no D-invariant
subbundle (resp. if it is the D-invariant direct sum of stable subbundles). It
has been shown in [C] that the polystability of (E,D) in this sense is
equivalent to the existence of a so-called harmonic metric in E. In this paper
we consider flat complex vector bundles on compact Hermitian manifolds (X,g).
We propose new notions of g-(poly-)stability of such bundles, and of g-Einstein
metrics in them; these notions coincide with (poly-)stability and harmonicity
in the sense of Corlette if g is a K\""ahler metric, but are different in
general. Our main result is that the g-polystability in our sense is equivalent
to the existence of a g-Hermitian-Einstein metric. Our notion of a g-Einstein
metric in a flat bundle is motivated by a correspondence between flat bundles
and Higgs bundles over compact surfaces, analogous to the correspondence in the
case of K\""ahler manifolds [S1], [S2], [S3].

within a systematic quantum statistical approach. We consider formation through
three-body collisions relevant already at rather moderate densities because of
the strong correlations. The three-body in-medium reaction rates driven by the
break-up cross section are calculated using exact three-body equations
(Alt-Grassberger-Sandhas type) that have been suitably modified to consistently
include the energy shift and the Pauli blocking. Important quantities are the
lifetime of deuteron fluctuations and the chemical relaxation time. We find
that the respective times differ substantially while using in-medium or
isolated cross sections. We expect implications for the description of heavy
ion collisions in particular for the formation of light charged particles at
low to intermediate energies.

environment plays a crucial role in producing the correct classical limit in
the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics is investigated, in the context of
a model of quantum Brownian motion. It is well known that one of the effects of
the interaction is to produce an extremely rapid approximate diagonalisation of
the reduced density matrix in the position representation. This effect is, by
itself, insufficient to produce generically quasi-classical behaviour of the
Bohmian trajectory. However, it is shown that, if the system particle is
initially in an approximate energy eigenstate, then there is a tendency for the
Bohmian trajectory to become approximately classical on a rather longer
time-scale. The relationship between this phenomenon and the behaviour of the
Wigner function post-decoherence (as analysed by Halliwell and Zoupas) is
discussed. It is also suggested that the phenomenon may be related to the
storage of information about the trajectory in the environment, and that it may
therefore be a general feature of every situation in which such environmental
monitoring occurs.
