synthesize SEDs from our simulations and compare them to fiducial SEDs derived
from observed systems. These simulations produce less distinct spiral structure
than isothermally evolved systems, especially in the inner third of the disk.
Pattern are similar further from the star but do not collapse into condensed
objects. The photosphere temperature is well fit to a power law in radius with
index $q\sim1.1$, which is very steep. Far from the star, internal heating
($PdV$ work and shocks) are not responsible for generating a large fraction of
the thermal energy contained in the disk matter. Gravitational torques
responsible for such shocks cannot transport mass and angular momentum
efficiently in the outer disk. Within $\sim$5--10 AU of the star, rapid break
up and reformation of spiral structure causes shocks, which provide sufficient
dissipation to power a larger fraction of the near IR energy output. The
spatial and size distribution of grains can have marked consequences on the
observed near IR SED and can lead to increased emission and variability on
$\lesssim 10$ year time scales. When grains are vaporized they do not reform
into a size distribution similar to that from which most opacity calculations
are based. With rapid grain reformation into the original size distribution,
the disk does not emit near infrared photons. With a plausible modification to
the opacity, it contributes much more.

increase of the `passive' layer thickness $d$. The domain width changes very
quickly at the transition (exponentially with $d^{-2}$). We have estimated the
dielectric response $dP/dE$ (the slope of the hysteresis loop) in the
`fatigued' multidomain state and found that it is in agreement with experiment,
assuming realistic parameters of the layer. We derive a simple universal
relation for the dielectric response, which scales as $1/d$, involving only the
properties of the passive layer. This relation qualitatively reproduces the
evolution of the hysteresis loop in fatigued samples and it could be tested

increase with decreasing lateral size of the film. We believe that specific

conductivity, only thermal conductivity maintains its universal value,

temperature thermal conductivity measurements provide the most direct means of
obtaining the velocity anisotropy for high T_c cuprate superconductors.

investigated within the strongly correlated Hubbard model on a semi-infinite

correlation is enhanced at the surface compared to the bulk. Therefore, within
the well-known Stoner-picture of band ferromagnetism one would expect the
magnetic stability at the surface to be enhanced as well. However, by taking
electron correlations into account well beyond the Hartree-Fock (Stoner) level
we find the opposite behavior: As a function of temperature the magnetization
of the surface layer decreases faster than in the bulk. By varying the hopping
integral within the surface layer this behavior becomes even more pronounced. A
reduced hopping integral at the surface tends to destabilize surface
ferromagnetism whereas the magnetic stability gets enhanced by an increased
hopping integral. This behavior represents a pure correlation effect and can be
understood in terms of general arguments which are based on exact results in
the limit of strong Coulomb interaction.

distribution but their relative density may vary continuously. In the limit of
only one component of dust, we get the solution for the rigidly rotating dust

proton beams are expected to occur at RHIC in BNL at sqrt{s} up to 500 GeV,
bringing a new quality to the collider physics. In collisions of polarized
particles, the presence of two axial vectors of initial polarizations, fully
controlled by experimenters, may dramatically increase the number of available
for tests correlations between participating vectors, generating asymmetries
that could relatively easily be measured. In frame of Standard Model (SM), many
of these asymmetries are either strongly suppressed or strictly prohibited.
Therefore, if some of them were found nonzero, this could be an indication of a
new physics beyond SM. If certain criteria met, it might be difficult to
explain the observed nonzero correlations in theories without CP- and/or

on the boundary of the past, and hence avoid contact with the caustics. In this
way the resulting light sheets and projections can be made much simpler. We
discuss the question of operational definability of these sheets within the
context of both proposals and conclude that in both cases the theoretical
existence of such sheets must be clearly distinguished from their complexity
and the difficulty of their construction in practice. This puts into
perspective the likely practical difficulties one would face in applying the
holographic principle to the real cosmos. These issues may also be of relevance

space $\Gamma_{X}$ together with corresponding marks. As another consequence of
our results we obtain a representation of the Lie-algebra of compactly
supported vector fields on $X$ on compound Poisson space. Finally
generalizations to the case when the compound Poisson measure is replaced by a

representations of classical groups are suitably characterized by irreducible
representations of the symmetric groups. However, due to their different
nature, vector and spinor representations are only connected and not united in
such description.
  Clifford algebras are an ideal tool with which to describe symmetries of
multi-particle systems since they contain spinor and vector representations
within the same formalism, and, moreover, allow for a complete study of all
classical Lie groups. In this work, together with an accompanying work also
presented at this conference, an analysis of q-symmetry -- for generic q's --
based on the ordinary symmetric groups is given for the first time. We
construct q-Young operators as Clifford idempotents and the Hecke algebra
representations in ideals generated by these operators. Various relations as
orthogonality of representations and completeness are given explicitly, and the
symmetry types of representations is discussed. Appropriate q-Young diagrams
and tableaux are given. The ordinary case of the symmetric group is obtained in
the limit q \to 1. All in all, a toolkit for Clifford algebraic treatment of
multi-particle systems is provided. The distinguishing feature of this paper is
that the Young operators of conjugated Young diagrams are related by Clifford
reversion, connecting Clifford algebra and Hecke algebra features. This
contrasts the purely Hecke algebraic approach of King and Wybourne, who do not
embed Hecke algebras into Clifford algebras.

of a population of neurons can be broken up into a series of terms, each of
which reflect something about potential coding mechanisms. This is possible in
the coding r{\'e}gime in which few spikes are emitted in the relevant time
window.
  This approach allows us to study the additional information contributed by
spike timing beyond that present in the spike counts; to examine the
contributions to the whole information of different statistical properties of
spike trains, such as firing rates and correlation functions; and forms the
basis for a new quantitative procedure for the analysis of simultaneous
multiple neuron recordings. It also provides theoretical constraints upon
neural coding strategies. We find a transition between two coding r{\'e}gimes,
depending upon the size of the relevant observation timescale. For time windows
shorter than the timescale of the stimulus-induced response fluctuations, there
exists a spike count coding phase, where the purely temporal information is of
third order in time. For time windows much longer than the characteristic
timescale, there can be additional timing information of first order, leading
to a temporal coding phase in which timing information may affect the
instantaneous information rate.
  We study the relative contributions of the dynamic firing rate and
correlation variables to the full temporal information; the interaction of
signal and noise correlations in temporal coding; synergy between spikes and
between cells; and the effect of refractoriness. We illustrate the utility of
the technique by analysis of a few cells from the rat barrel cortex.

incompatibility of the Hardy equations for this class of states physically
originates from the fact that the existence of quantum perfect correlations for
the three pairs of two-valued observables (D_11,D_21), (D_11,D_22) and
(D_12,D_21) [in the sense of having with certainty equal (different) readings
for a joint measurement of any one of the pairs (D_11,D_21), (D_11,D_22), and

observables (D_12,D_22) [in the sense of having with certainty equal
(different) readings for a joint measurement of the pair (D_12,D_22)]. Indeed,
the set of these four perfect correlations is found to satisfy the CHSH
inequality, and then no violations of local realism will arise for the
maximally entangled state as far as the four observables D_ij, i,j = 1,2, are
concerned. The connection between this fact and the impossibility for the
quantum mechanical predictions to give the maximum possible theoretical
violation of the CHSH inequality is pointed out. Moreover, it is generally
proved that the fulfillment of all the Hardy nonlocality conditions necessarily
entails a violation of the resulting CHSH inequality. The largest violation of
this latter inequality is determined.
