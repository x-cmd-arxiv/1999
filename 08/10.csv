evident. We focus our attention on the production of structure in dark halos
and in cluster ellipticals. Any distortion produced in a dark halo can distort
the embedded stellar disk, possibly leading to the formation of lopsided and
warped disks. Features excited in an elliptical are directly observable and we
predict that asymmetries in the morphologies of these systems can be produced
by relatively small perturbers. We use these detailed results to predict the
distribution of the $A$ parameter defined by Abraham et al. and the shift
between the center of mass of the primary system and the position of the peak
of density for a range of environments. We find that high-density, low-velocity
dispersion environments are more likely to host galaxies with significant
asymmetries. Our distribution for the $A$ parameter is in good agreement with
the range spanned by the observed values for local galaxy clusters and for
distant galaxies in the MDS and in the HDF.Finally, we propose a generalized
asymmetry parameter $A(r)$ which provides detailed information on the radial
structure of the asymmetry produced by the mechanism explored in our work.

  Aus., substantially revised and enlarged",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Several lines of evidence suggest that cold, dense gas clouds make a
substantial contribution to the total mass of dark halos. If so then physical
collisions between clouds must occur; these cause strong, radiative shocks to
propagate through the cold gas, with the startling implication that all
``dark'' halos must be luminous. The expected luminosity is a strong function
of halo velocity dispersion, and should contribute a significant fraction of
the observed X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies, if dark halos are
predominantly made of cold gas.
  Existing data do not exclude this possibility; indeed two particular
expectations of the luminous-halo model are borne out in the X-ray data, and
thus give support to the cold-cloud dark matter model. First we find a
luminosity-temperature correlation of the form L proportional to T to the power
11/4, as seen in recent analyses of cluster samples. Secondly the anticipated
spectra have substantially more power at low energies than isothermal
bremsstrahlung spectra, and might account for the observed ``excess'' EUV
emission seen from some clusters. The successes of the luminous-halo model are
particularly remarkable because the theory has no free parameters or ad hoc
elements. The model can be tested by the X-ray satellite Chandra, which should
resolve the Virgo cluster into 10,000 point-like, transient X-ray sources.
Non-detection of any such sources by Chandra can constrain the contribution of
cold gas clouds to below 1% of the total matter density in the Universe,
assuming Virgo to be representative.

alternately-attached leg (PAAL) chain and an open diamond (OD) chain. All of
these models have a flat band (or equivalently, degenerate single-electron
eigenvalues). The PD and OD chains commonly have a local-loop structure.
Nagaoka's theorem holds only in the PD chain. At half-filling, it have been
rigorously proven that all of these models are ferrimagnet. Away from
half-filling, however, quite different magnetic properties are found. In the
fillings 1/3< rho_e <1/2, the ground state of the PD chain for a
infinitely-large U is the extended ferromagnetic state, that is, the saturated
ferromagnetic state or the spiral state for odd or even number of electrons,
respectively. In the PAAL chain, on the other hand, there is no magnetic order.
Thus, the flat band is found to be not a sufficient condition of the extended
ferromagnetic state. We find, moreover, that the saturated ferromagnetism
appears in the OD chain, although the Nagaoka theorem does not hold on this
chain. This indicates that the local-loop structure plays an important role on
the appearance of the extended ferromagnetic state.

as a system of linear equations. This linear system illustrates several
familiar aspects of experimental data analysis. Bayesian probability theory is
used to find a solution to this binomial measurement problem that allows for
the straightforward construction of confidence intervals. This solution is also
shown to provide an unbiased formalism for evaluating the behavior of data sets
under different choices of cuts, including a cut designed to increase the
significance of a possible, albeit previously unseen, signal.
  Several examples are used to illustrate the features of this method,
including the discovery of the top quark and searches for new particles
produced in association with $W^{\pm}$ bosons. It is also demonstrated how to
use this method to make projections for the potential discovery of a Standard
Model Higgs boson at a Tevatron Run 2 experiment, as well as the utility of
measuring the integrated luminosity through inclusive $p\bar{p} \to W^{\pm}$
production.

reformulates earlier conjectured entropy bounds of Bekenstein and also of
Fischler and Susskind, and can be interpreted as a statement of the so-called
holographic principle. We show that Bousso's entropy bound can be derived from
either of two sets of hypotheses. The first set of hypotheses is (i) associated
with each null surface L in spacetime there is an entropy flux 4-vector s^a_L
whose integral over L is the entropy flux through L, and (ii) along each null
geodesic generator of L, we have $|s^a_L k_a| \le \pi (\lambda_\infty -
\lambda) T_{ab} k^a k^b$, where $T_{ab}$ is the stress-energy tensor, $\lambda$
is an affine parameter, $k^a = (d / d\lambda)^a$, and $\lambda_\infty$ is the
value of affine parameter at the endpoint of the geodesic. The second (purely
local) set of hypotheses is (i) there exists an absolute entropy flux 4-vector
s^a such that the entropy flux through any null surface L is the integral of
s^a over L, and (ii) this entropy flux 4-vector obeys the pointwise
inequalities $(s_a k^a)^2 \le T_{ab} k^a k^b / (16 \pi)$ and $|k^a k^b \nabla_a

For a model of the physical vacuum as a superposition of Abelian configurations

model corresponds to the gauge sector of SU(2) Georgi-Glashow model.

by partitions $\lambda$ of $n$, and for a nilpotent $\eta$ in the class
parametrised by $\lambda$, the variety $F_\eta$ of $\eta$-stable flags has its
irreducible components parametrised by the standard Young tableaux of shape
$\lambda$. We indicate how several algorithmic constructions defined for Young
tableaux have significance in this context, thus extending Steinberg's result
that the relative position of flags generically chosen in the irreducible
components of $F_\eta$ parametrised by tableaux $P$ and $Q$, is the permutation
associated to $(P,Q)$ under the Robinson-Schensted correspondence. Other
constructions for which we give interpretations are Sch\""utzenberger's
involution of the set of Young tableaux, jeu de taquin (leading also to an
interpretation of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients), and the transpose
Robinson-Schensted correspondence (defined using column insertion). In each
case we use a doubly indexed family of partitions, defined in terms of the flag
(or pair of flags) determined by a point chosen in the variety under
consideration. We show that for generic choices, the family satisfies certain
combinatorial relations, whence the family describes the computation of the
algorithmic operation being interpreted, as we described in a previous
publication.

As both of these flow components are in the reaction plane these form an
enhanced 'elliptic flow' pattern. Recent experimental data at 11 AGeV and above
show the same softening, hinting at QGP formation.
