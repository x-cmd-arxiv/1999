objects detected in the 4.5 square degree area of central parts of the LMC.
About 3.4*10^5 BVI measurements of these stars were collected during the
OGLE-II microlensing survey. The Catalog data include period, BVI photometry,
astrometry, and R_21, \phi_21 parameters of the Fourier decomposition of I-band
light curve.
  The vast majority of objects from the Catalog are the classical Cepheids
pulsating in the fundamental or first overtone mode. The remaining objects
include Population II Cepheids and red giants with pulsation-like light curves.
  Tests of completeness performed in overlapping parts of adjacent fields
indicate that completeness of the Catalog is very high: >96%. Statistics and
distributions of basic parameters of Cepheids are also presented.
  Finally, we show the light curves of three eclipsing systems containing
Cepheid detected among objects of the Catalog.
  All presented data, including individual BVI observations are available from
the OGLE Internet archive.

optically and radio selected QSOs are positively correlated with nearby
galaxies on a range of angular scales up to a degree. Obscuration by unevenly
distributed Galactic dust can be ruled out as the cause, leaving weak
statistical lensing as the physical process responsible. However the amplitude
of correlations on < 1 degree scales is at least a factor of a few larger than
lensing model predictions. A possible way to reconcile the observations and
theory is to revise the weak lensing formalism. We extend the standard lensing
formulation to include the next higher order term (second order) in the
geodesic equation of motion for photons. We derive relevant equations
applicable in the weak lensing regime, and discuss qualitative properties of
the updated formulation. We then perform numerical integrations of the revised
equation and study the effect of the extra term using two different types of
cosmic mass density fluctuations. We find that nearby large-scale coherent
structures increase the amplitude of the predicted lensing-induced correlations
between QSOs and foreground galaxies by ~ 10% (not a factor of several required
by observations), while the redshift of the optimal, i.e. `most correlated'
structures is moved closer to the observer compared to what is predicted using
the standard lensing equation.

This mechanism may be important for the large scale structure formation of the

a characteristic scale of 130h^{-1} Mpc (comoving size) in the distribution of
the visible matter.
  The detailed analysis showed that both the observed very large scale of the
visible matter distribution in the Universe and the observed baryon asymmetry
value could naturally appear as a result of the evolution of a complex scalar
field condensate, formed at the inflationary stage.
  Moreover, according to our model, the visible part of the Universe at present
may consist of baryonic and antibaryonic regions, sufficiently separated, so
that annihilation radiation is not observed.

new theory of screening of a macroion by multivalent cations, which shows that
due to strong cation correlations at the surface of DNA the net charge of DNA
changes sign at some small concentration of cations N_0. DNA condensation takes
place in the vicinity of N_0, where absolute value of the DNA net charge is
small and the correlation induced short range attraction dominates the Coulomb
repulsion. At N > N_0 positive DNA should move in the oppisite direction in an
electrophoresis experiment. From comparison of our theory with experimental
values of condensation and resolubilization thresholds for DNA solution
containing Spe$^{4+}$, we obtain that N_0 = 3.2 mM and that the energy of DNA

external saddle does not belong to a basin of attraction of an initial
attractor. A complete rigorous analysis of the problem for the most probable
escape path is presented and a corresponding escape rate is calculated with a
logarithmic accuracy. Unlike a conventional rate for a quasi-stationary flux,
the rate on shorter time-scales strongly depends on friction, moreover, it may
undergo oscillations in the underdamped range and a cutoff in the overdamped
range.
  A generalization of the results for inter-attractor transitions in stable
potentials with more than two wells is also presented as well as a splitting
procedure for a phenomenological description of inter-attractor transitions is
suggested.
  Applications to such problems as a dynamics of escape on time-scales shorter
than an optimal fluctuation duration, prehistory problem, optimal control of
fluctuations, fluctuational transport in ratchets, escapes at a periodic
driving and transitions in biased Josephson junctions and ionic channels are
briefly discussed.

orbits is described, to generate proton beams of 120-2000 MeV energy at tens of
GW pulsed and hundreds of MW in continuous beam power operation. Accelerated
beam losses must be less than 0.1 W/m for the intercepted average beam power
linear density. The concept is inherently configured to actively compensate the
longitudinal and transverse space charge expansion in beam bunches. These are
based on (1) actively varying the bunch acceleration equilibrium phase while
maintaining isochronism, independently for each cyclotron turns; (2)
independently changing the acceleration voltage for each turn together with
orbit corrections that preserve isochronism; (3) independently changing the
transverse betatron oscillation tune shift, to assure non-resonant operation.
Also, (4) sextupole lenses are included to compensate for chromaticity effects.
Moreover, the concept is based on optimum uses of practical successful results
so far achieved in beam acceleration and storage techniques. This accelerator
can be used to deliver a pulsed intense source of neutrons without the use of
storage rings, and to drive the different transmutation technologies. As an
example of such a cyclotron system, we describe our approach of accelerating
single-bunch proton beams at up to 1 GeV energy, with pulsed beam power of 80
GW and bunch duration of 2 ns. The exemplar cyclotron accelerator system is
configured to be located in the shielded structure of the 6-GeV Yerevan
Electron Synchrotron. The cost of such a cyclotron system is estimated to be
approximately 40,000,000 US dollars, if implemented in Armenia at substantially
reduced labor costs.
