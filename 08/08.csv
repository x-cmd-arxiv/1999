Repeater 1900+14, and of the apparent ""braking glitch"", \Delta P/P = l x 10^-4,
that was concurrent with the Aug. 27th giant flare. A radiation-hydrodynamical
outflow associated with the flare could impart the required torque, but only if
the dipole magnetic field is stronger than ~ 10^14 G and the outflow lasts
longer and/or is more energetic than the observed X-ray flare. A positive
period increment is also a natural consequence of a gradual, plastic
deformation of the neutron star crust by an intense magnetic field, which
forces the neutron superfluid to rotate more slowly than the crust. Sudden
unpinning of the neutron vortex lines during the August 27th event would then
induce a glitch opposite in sign to those observed in young pulsars, but of a
much larger magnitude as a result of the slower rotation.
  The change in the persistent X-ray lightcurve following the August 27 event
is ascribed to continued particle heating in the active region of that
outburst. The enhanced X-ray output can be powered by a steady current flowing
through the magnetosphere, induced by the twisting motion of the crust. The
long term rate of spindown appears to be accelerated with respect to a simple
magnetic dipole torque. Accelerated spindown of a seismically-active magnetar
will occur when its persistent output of Alfven waves and particles exceeds its
spindown luminosity. We suggest that SGRs experience some episodes of relative
inactivity, with diminished spindown rates, and that such inactive magnetars
are observed as Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs). The rapid reappearence of
persistent X-ray emission following August 27 flare gives evidence against
accretion-powered models.

anisotropy due to fluctuations of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect through
clusters of galaxies. A contribution from the correlation among clusters is
especially focused on, which has been neglected in the previous analyses.
Employing the evolving linear bias factor based on the Press-Schechter
formalism, we find that the clustering contribution amounts to 20-30% of the
Poissonian one at degree angular scales. If we exclude clusters in the local
universe, it even exceeds the Poissonian noise, and makes dominant contribution
to the angular power spectrum. As a concrete example, we demonstrate the
subtraction of the ROSAT X-ray flux-limited cluster samples. It indicates that
we should include the clustering effect in the analysis of the SZ fluctuations.
We further find that the degree scale spectra essentially depend upon the
normalization of the density fluctuations, i.e., \sigma_8, and the gas mass
fraction of the cluster, rather than the density parameter of the universe and
details of cluster evolution models. Our results show that the SZ fluctuations
at the degree scale will provide a possible measure of \sigma_8, while the
arc-minute spectra a probe of the cluster evolution. In addition, the
clustering spectrum will give us valuable information on the bias at high
redshift, if we can detect it by removing X-ray luminous clusters.

incommensurate (IC) static spin correlations in La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 which is an
insulating spin glass at low temperatures. The present neutron scattering
experiments on the same x=0.05 crystal employ a narrower instrumental
Q-resolution and thereby have revealed that the crystal has only two
orthorhombic twins at low temperatures with relative populations of 2:1. We
find that, in a single twin, only two satellites are observed at (1, +/-0.064,
L)(ortho) and (0, 1+/-0.064, L)(ortho), that is, the modulation vector is only
along the orthorhombic b*-axis. This demonstrates unambiguously that
La1.95Sr0.05CuO4 has a one-dimensional static diagonal spin modulation at low
temperatures, consistent with certain stripe models. We have also reexamined
the x=0.04 crystal that previously was reported to show a single commensurate
peak. By mounting the sample in the (H, K, 0) zone, we have discovered that the
x=0.04 sample in fact has the same IC structure as the $x=0.05$ sample. The
incommensurability parameter d for x=0.04 and 0.05, where d is the distance
from (1/2, 1/2) in tetragonal reciprocal lattice units, follows the linear
relation d=x. These results demonstrate that the insulator to superconductor
transition in the under doped regime (0.05 </= x </= 0.06) in La2-xSrxCuO4 is
coincident with a transition from diagonal to collinear static stripes at low
temperatures thereby evincing the intimate coupling between the one dimensional
spin density modulation and the superconductivity.

Events with primary strange quarks are tagged by the presence in each event

The CCD vertex detector is used to suppress the background from heavy flavor

axis in the direction of the initial strange quark. The coupling A_s is

"physics/9908015","Doug Snyder","D. M. Snyder","Dark Matter","5 pages; abstract and conclusion edited",,,"05-97","physics.gen-ph",,"  Gravitational force manifested in its affect on rotational velocity is what
indicates the presence of dark matter in individual galaxies. Newtonian
mechanics is generally used to derive the relationship between rotational
velocity and gravitational force. In Newtonian mechanics, mass is associated
with gravitation. At the same time, in such galaxies there appears to be
insufficient gravitational mass to account for the size of the gravitational
force deduced from rotational velocity. The general theory of relativity
encompasses Newtonian mechanics and also indicates that reference frames
provide the means to develop spacetime curvature that expresses the
gravitational field. It is reasonable to conclude that because of the more
fundamental character of the general theory of relativity, the reference frames
that are a key element of the general theory form the basis for understanding
gravitation, and not mass.
