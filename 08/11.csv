cosmological N-body simulations with constraints derived from the Milky Way
disk dynamics and from the Tully-Fisher relation. For currently favored values
of the cosmological parameters ($\Omega_0 \sim 0.3$; $\Lambda_0=1-\Omega_0 \sim
0.7$; $h \sim 0.7$; COBE- and cluster abundance-normalized $\sigma_8$; Big-Bang
nucleosynthesis $\Omega_b$), we find that halos with circular velocities
comparable to the rotation speed of the Galaxy have typically {\it three times}
more dark matter inside the solar circle than inferred from observations of
Galactic dynamics. Such high central concentrations of dark matter on the scale
of galaxy disks also imply that stellar mass-to-light ratios much lower than
expected from population synthesis models must be assumed in order to reproduce
the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation. Indeed, even under the extreme
assumption that {\it all} baryons in a dark halo are turned into stars, disks
with conventional $I$-band stellar mass-to-light ratios ($M/L_I \sim 2 \pm 1
(M/L_I)_{\odot}$) are about two magnitudes fainter than observed at a given
rotation speed. We examine several modifications to the $\Lambda$CDM model that
may account for these discrepancies and conclude that agreement can only be
accomplished at the expense of renouncing other major successes of the model.
Reproducing the observed properties of disk galaxies thus appears to demand
substantial revision to the currently most successful model of structure
formation.

such models, the probability distribution for $\rho_\L$ is a product of an {\it
a priori} distribution ${\cal P}_*(\rho_\L)$ and of the number density of
galaxies at a given $\rho_\L$ (which is proportional to the number of observers
who will detect that value of $\rho_\L$). To determine ${\cal P}_*$, we
consider inflationary models in which the role of the vacuum energy is played
by a slowly-varying potential of some scalar field. We show that the resulting
distribution depends on the shape of the potential and generally has a
non-trivial dependence on $\rho_\L$, even in the narrow anthropically allowed
range. This is contrary to Weinberg's earlier conjecture that the {\it a
priori} distribution should be nearly flat in the range of interest. We
calculate the (final) probability distributions for $\rho_\L$ and for
$t_G/t_\L$ in simple models with power-law potentials. For some of these
models, the agreement with the observationally suggested values of $\rho_\L$ is
better than with a flat {\it a priori} distribution. We also discuss
quantum-cosmological approach in which $\rho_\L$ takes different values in
different disconnected universes and argue that Weinberg's conjecture is not
valid in this case as well. Finally, we extend our analysis to models of
quintessence, with similar conclusions.

recent measurements of hyperbolic radar meteors give information on the
properties of the interstellar solid particle population in the solar vicinity.
Especially the distribution of grain masses is indicative of growth and
destruction mechanisms that govern the grain evolution in the interstellar
medium. The mass of an impacting dust grain is derived from its impact velocity
and the amount of plasma generated by the impact. Because the initial velocity
and the dynamics of interstellar particles in the Solar System are well known,
we use an approximated theoretical instead of the measured impact velocity to
derive the mass of interstellar grains from the Ulysses and Galileo in-situ
data. The revised mass distributions are steeper and thus contain less large
grains than the ones that use measured impact velocities, but large grains
still contribute significantly to the overall mass of the detected grains. The
flux of interstellar grains with masses $> 10^{-14} {\rm kg}$ is determined to
be $1\cdot 10^{-6} {\rm m}^{-2} {\rm s}^{-1}$. The comparison of radar data
with the extrapolation of the Ulysses and Galileo mass distribution indicates
that the very large ($m > 10^{-10} {\rm kg}$) hyperbolic meteoroids detected by

local disk with respect to galaxies. The SPM data are best fit by models having
a solar peculiar motion of +5 km~s$^{-1}$ in the V-component (pointing in the
direction of Galactic rotation), a large LSR speed of 270 km~s$^{-1}$, and a
disk velocity ellipsoid that points towards the Galactic center. We stress,
however, that these results rest crucially on the assumptions of both

time-averaged burst spectra. Thus, there are generally three spectral shape
parameters available for each of the 5500 total spectra: a low-energy power-law

Q2237+0305 during a High Magnification Event (HME) is potentially a very
powerful tool for probing the structure of the quasars accretion disc on scales
of less than 10^-8 arc seconds. How often we can expect to observe a HME is
dependent on the lens system parameters of galactic transverse velocity, mean
microlens mass and the size of the magnified continuum source. We have
previously used published microlensed light-curves to obtain expressions for
the likely-hood of the values for these parameters (Wyithe, Webster & Turner
1999b,2000; Wyithe, Webster, Turner & Mortlock 2000). Here we use this
information to investigate the expected rate of SHMEs. We find the average rate
of SHMEs as well as the number that we can expect to observe over periods of a
decade and of a single observing season. We find that the average SHME rate
summed over all images in Q2237+0305 is 1.5\pm0.6 - 6.3\pm1.3 events per
decade. During the period following a caustic crossing we find that the event
rate in the corresponding image is enhanced by 50-100%, and therefore that the
overall event rate may be higher during these periods.
  From the distribution of events expected during a 6 month period we find that
there is 1 chance in 4-10 of observing a SHME per observing season. The
systematic dependence in these values arises from the different assumptions for
smooth matter content, orientation of the galactic transverse velocity and the
size of photometric error in the monitoring data. The results support continued
monitoring of Q2237+0305 with the aim of obtaining detailed spectroscopic and
photometric observations of a SHME.

kinematics are derived from observations of the CO J=(1-0) line made with the

observed kinematics to those predicted by ideal gas hydrodynamic and ballistic
cloud-based models of gas flow in a barred potential. The hydrodynamic model is
in good qualitative agreement with both the current observations of the dense
gas and previous observations of the kinematics of the ionized gas. The
observed kinematics indicate that the gas abruptly changes direction upon
entering the dust lanes to flow directly down the dust lanes along the leading
edge of the bar until the dust lanes approach the nuclear ring. Near the
location where the dust lanes intersect the nuclear ring, we see two velocity
components: a low velocity component, corresponding to gas on circular orbits,
and a higher velocity component, which can be attributed to the fraction of gas
flowing down the bar dust lane which sprays past the contact point toward the
other half of the bar. The ballistic cloud-based model of the ISM is not
consistent with the observed kinematics. The kinematics in the dust lanes
require large velocity gradients which cannot be reproduced by an ISM composed
of ballistic clouds with long mean-free-paths. Therefore, even the dense ISM
responds to hydrodynamic forces.

Although we expect strong hard X-ray emission from the SMBH-driven activity,
the radio-excess multinuclei merging IRLGs show considerably smaller hard X-ray
luminosities relative to far-infrared (40$-$500 $\mu$m) and infrared (8$-$1000

suppressed compared to a typical spectral energy distribution of SMBH-driven
activity in AGNs. If this is a common property of merging IRLGs, without its
correction, hard X-ray observations underestimate the contribution of

We report two types of scaling behavior corresponding to (a) low disorder

external field is increased, and (b) large disorder regime, which is
characterized with nucleation of many domains. The effects of finite
concentration of nonmagnetic ions and variable driving rate on the scaling

disorder is shown to belong to a class of critical dynamic systems, which are
described by a fixed point of the stochastic transport equation with

evidence of pairing with favored J=0 ground states and an energy gap, but the
relationship between ground state wave functions of neighboring nuclei show
signatures of pairing as well. Matrix elements of pair creation/annihilation
operators between ground states tend to be strongly enhanced. Furthermore, the
same or similar pair operators connect several ground states along an isotopic
chain. This algebraic structure is reminiscent of the generalized seniority
model. Thus pairing may be encoded to a certain extent in the Fock space
connectivity of the interacting shell model even without specific features of

Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach. It is shown that various usually
employed RMF forces, which give fair description of normal stable nuclei, give
quite different predictions for superheavy elements. Among the effective forces
we tested, TM1 is found to be the good candidate to describe superheavy
elements. The binding energies of the $^{293}$118 nucleus and its
$\alpha-$decay daughter nuclei obtained using TM1 agree with those of FRDM
within 2 MeV. Similar conclusion that TM1 is the good interaction is also drawn
from the calculated binding energies for Pb isotopes with the Relativistic
Continuum Hartree Bogoliubov (RCHB) theory. Using the pairing gaps obtained
from RCHB, RMF calculations with pairing and deformation are carried out for
the structure of superheavy elements. The binding energy, shape, single
particle levels, and the Q values of the $\alpha-$decay $Q_{\alpha}$ are
discussed, and it is shown that both pairing correlation and deformation are
essential to properly understand the structure of superheavy elements. A good
agreement is obtained with experimental data on $Q_{\alpha}$. %Especially, the
atomic number %dependence of $Q_{\alpha}$ %seems to match with the experimental

in tiny chambers or on a surface). The reactions catalyzed by all 20
synthetases are monitored in a spatially resolved manner. Each separately
positioned synthetase or tRNA will signal its cognate amino acid. The
synthetase reactions can be monitored using continuous spectroscopic assays.
Alternatively, since elongation factor Tu;GTP (EF-Tu;GTP) specifically binds
all AA-tRNAs, the aminoacylation reactions catalyzed by the synthetases can be
monitored using ligand assays. Microarrays for amino acid analysis are
suggested. Additionally, it is possible that amino acid analysis arrays can be
integrated with aminopeptidase or carboxypeptidase digestions to produce
miniaturized enzymatic sequenators capable of generating either N- or
C-terminal sequence data at femtomole-attomole levels. The possibility of
parallel processing of many samples in an automated manner is discussed.

correlation on the structure of the other 27 base pairs, for which only

conclusion that there exists no self-adjoint time operator conjugate to a
semibounded or discrete Hamiltonian despite some well-known illustrative
counterexamples. In this paper we evaluate Pauli's theorem against the single
Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, and consequently show the
consistency of assuming a bounded, self-adjoint time operator canonically
conjugate to a Hamiltonian with an unbounded, or semibounded, or finite point
spectrum. We point out Pauli's implicit assumptions and show that they are not
consistent in a single Hilbert space. We demonstrate our analysis by giving two
explicit examples. Moreover, we clarify issues sorrounding the different
solutions to the canonical commutation relations, and, consequently, expand the
class of acceptable canonical pairs beyond the solutions required by Pauli's
theorem.
