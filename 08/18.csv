accretion flows which cannot cool through emission of radiation are presented.
The calculations begin from an equilibrium configuration consisting of a thick
torus with constant specific angular momentum. Accretion is induced by the
addition of a small anomalous azimuthal shear stress which is characterized by
a function \nu. We study the flows generated as the amplitude and form of \nu
are varied. A spherical polar grid which spans more than two orders of
magnitude in radius is used to resolve the flow over a wide range of spatial
scales. We find that convection in the inner regions produces significant
outward mass motions that carry away both the energy liberated by, and a large
fraction of the mass participating in, the accretion flow. Although the
instantaneous structure of the flow is complex and dominated by convective
eddies, long time averages of the dynamical variables show remarkable
correspondence to certain steady-state solutions. Near the equatorial plane,
the radial profiles of the time-averaged variables are power-laws with an index
that depends on the radial scaling of the shear stress. We find that regardless
of the adiabatic index of the gas, or the form or magnitude of the shear
stress, the mass inflow rate is a strongly increasing function of radius, and
is everywhere nearly exactly balanced by mass outflow. The net mass accretion
rate through the disc is only a fraction of the rate at which mass is supplied
to the inflow at large radii, and is given by the local, viscous accretion rate
associated with the flow properties near the central object.

imprinted by initial conditions or develops from an initially symmetric
distribution. We attempt to discriminate between these two possibilities by
exploring the implications of the latter one. From the observed distribution of
satellite galaxies relative to the primary galaxy's disk, we derive constrains
on the orbital inclinations of the current satellite population. Using this
derived inclination limit and assuming that the initial population had no
preferred orbital inclination, we estimate the size of the hypothesized
original population. We find that our best-fit models imply a population of
destroyed (or inhibited) satellites whose combined luminosity (assuming the

the two basic, apparently universal features shown by all observations of
nearby stellar systems: (1) a characteristic stellar mass of the order of one
solar mass, and (2) a power-law decline of the IMF at large masses similar to
the original Salpeter law. Considerable evidence and theoretical work supports
the hypothesis that the characteristic stellar mass derives from a
characteristic scale of fragmentation in star-forming clouds which is
essentially the Jeans scale as calculated from the typical temperature and
pressure in molecular clouds. The power-law decline of the IMF at large masses
suggests that the most massive stars are built up by scale-free accretion or
accumulation processes, and the observed formation of these stars in dense
clusters and close multiple systems suggests that interactions between dense
prestellar clumps or protostars in forming clusters will play a role. A simple
model postulating successive mergers of subsystems in a forming cluster
accompanied by the accretion of a fraction of the residual gas by the most
massive protostar during each merger predicts an upper IMF of power-law form
and reproduces the Salpeter law with a plausible assumed accretion efficiency.

  We find that there is a strong correlation between total fluence and E_p. We
discuss these results in terms of both cosmological and intrinsic effects.
  In particular, we show that for realistic distributions of the burst
parameters, cosmological expansion alone cannot account for the correlation
between E_p and total fluence; the observed correlation is likely a result of
an intrinsic relation between the burst rest-frame peak energy and the total
radiated energy. We investigate this latter scenario in the context of
synchrotron radiation from external and internal shock models of GRBs. We find
that the internal shock model is consistent with our interpretation of the

Coriolis force due to the star's rotation, and their characteristic frequencies
are comparable with the rotation frequency $\Omega$ of the star. So called
r-mode oscillations form a sub-class of the inertial modes. In this paper, we
use the term ``r-modes'' to denote the inertial modes for which the toroidal
motion dominates the spheroidal motion, and the term ``inertial modes'' to
denote the inertial modes for which the toroidal and spheroidal motions have
comparable amplitude to each other. Using the slow rotation approximation
consistent up to the order of $\Omega^3$, we study the properties of the
inertial modes and r-modes, by taking account of the effect of the rotational
deformation of the equilibrium on the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions. The
eigenfrequencies of the r-modes and inertial modes calculated in this paper are
in excellent agreement with those obtained by Lindblom et al (1999) and
Lockitch & Friedman (1998). We also estimate the dissipation timescales due to
the gravitational radiation and several viscous processes for polytropic
neutron star models. We find that for the inertial modes, the mass multipole
gravitational radiation dominates the current multipole radiation, which is
dominating in the case of the r-modes. It is also found that the inertial mode
instability is more unstable than previously reported by Lockitch & Friedman

incorporating the observed radial density distribution for M1-67 reveals

red clusters have significantly different mass distributions. However, that one
sub-population is half as old as the other is excluded at the 99% confidence

galaxy's major star-formation episodes. Consequently, the vast majority of
globular clusters, and by implication the majority of stars, in NGC 4472 formed
at high redshifts but by two distinct mechanisms or in two episodes.

first multi-dimensional calculations for nuclear burning fronts have been

beyond the current state of the art, these calculations provided a new and
better understanding of the physics, and new descriptions for the flame
propagation have been proposed. Here, we have studied the influence on the
results of previous analyses of Type Ia Supernovae, namely, the nucleosynthesis
and structure of the expanding envelope. Our calculations are based on a set of
delayed detonation models with parameters that give a good account of the
optical and infrared light curves, and of the spectral evolution. In this

subsequently, turns into a detonation. The explosions and light curves are
calculated using a one-dimensional Lagrangian radiation-hydro code, including a

diverges when periodic orbits undergo bifurcations, and must be replaced with a

feature, these approximations require the inclusion of complex ``ghost
orbits''. By studying an example taken from the Diamagnetic Kepler Problem,
viz. the period-quadrupling of the balloon-orbit, we demonstrate that these
ghost orbits themselves can undergo bifurcations, giving rise to non-generic
complicated bifurcation scenarios. We extend classical normal form theory so as
to yield analytic descriptions of both bifurcations of real orbits and ghost
orbit bifurcations. We then show how the normal form serves to obtain a uniform

ghost bifurcation produces signatures in the semiclassical spectrum in much the

well-established area of research within the general context of Strongly
Correlated Electrons. This effort has been triggered by an unusual
cross-fertilization between theory and experiments. In this paper, the main
experimental results obtained in the context of ladders are reviewed from the
perspective of a theorist. Emphasis is given to the many similarities between
the two-dimensional high-$\rm T_c$ cuprates and the two-leg ladder compounds,
including Sr$_{14-x}$Ca$_x$Cu$_{24}$O$_{41}$ (14-24-41) which has a
superconducting phase at high pressure and a small hole density. Examples of
these similarities include regimes of linear resistivity vs temperature in
metallic ladders and a normal state with spin-gap or pseudogap characteristics.
Some controversial results in this context are also discussed. It is remarked
that the ladder 14-24-41 is the first superconducting copper-oxide material
with a non-square-lattice layered arrangement, and certainly much can be
learned from a careful analysis of this compound. A short summary of the main
theoretical developments in this field is also included, as well as a brief
description of the properties of non-copper-oxide ladders. Suggestions by the
author on possible experiments are described in the text. Overall, it is
concluded that the enormous experimental effort carried out on ladders has
already unveiled quite challenging and interesting physics that adds to the
rich behavior of electrons in transition-metal-oxides, and in addition
contributes to the understanding of the two-dimensional cuprates. However,
still considerable work needs to be carried out to fully understand the
interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom in these materials.

  In particular, we are interested in COINs in which each agent runs a
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. Rather than use a conventional modeling
approach (e.g., model the system dynamics, and hand-tune agents to cooperate),
we aim to solve the COIN design problem implicitly, via the ``adaptive''
character of the RL algorithms of each of the agents. This approach introduces
an entirely new, profound design problem: Assuming the RL algorithms are able
to achieve high rewards, what reward functions for the individual agents will,
when pursued by those agents, result in high world utility? In other words,
what reward functions will best ensure that we do not have phenomena like the
tragedy of the commons, Braess's paradox, or the liquidity trap?
  Although still very young, research specifically concentrating on the COIN
design problem has already resulted in successes in artificial domains, in
particular in packet-routing, the leader-follower problem, and in variants of
Arthur's El Farol bar problem. It is expected that as it matures and draws upon
other disciplines related to COINs, this research will greatly expand the range
of tasks addressable by human engineers. Moreover, in addition to drawing on
them, such a fully developed scie nce of COIN design may provide much insight
into other already established scientific fields, such as economics, game

of various relevant supersymmetric parameters. On the other hand, although the
phase $\Phi_\mu$ of the higgsino mass parameter is set to be zero, the

these families. Theoretical predictions for family sizes are obtained from two
models, one in which individual genes duplicate and a second in which the

  replaced with a few correction in abstract",,,,"physics.ins-det astro-ph nucl-ex",,"  The principle of operation, design, registration system and main
characteristics of a fast neutrons spectrometer are described. The spectrometer
is intended for direct measurements of ultra low fluxes of fast neutrons. It is
sensitive to neutron fluxes of 10^-7 neutrons/(cm^2 s^1) and lower with the
neutron energy above 700 keV. The detection efficiency of fast neutrons with
simultaneous energy measurement is within 0.02-0.06. The neutron spectrometer
was designed taking into account requirements for minimizing the gamma-ray
background. It is a calorimeter based on a pure liquid organic
scintillator-thermalizer with helium proportional counters as capturers of
thermalized neutrons distributed uniformly over the volume. Low-level signal
electronics for the spectrometer were designed with signal-to-noise ratio
optimization and full pulse shape analysis required for efficient rejection of
background events. A data acquisition and processing system is based on fast
(100 MHz) two-channel PC/AT interfaced digital oscilloscope. The acquisition
software was written in the C programming language.

  Communications",,"10.1016/S0030-4018(99)00615-X",,"quant-ph cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  We discuss the possibility that photons, which are bosons, can form a 2D
superfluid due to Bose-Einstein condensation inside a nonlinear Fabry-Perot
cavity filled with atoms in their ground states. A ""photon fluid"" forms inside
the cavity as a result of multiple photon-photon collisions mediated by the
atoms during a cavity ring-down time. The effective mass and chemical potential
for a photon inside this fluid are nonvanishing. This implies the existence of
a Bogoliubov dispersion relation for the low-lying elementary excitations of
the photon fluid, and in particular, that sound waves exist for
long-wavelength, low-frequency disturbances of this fluid. Possible experiments
to test for the superfluidity of the photon fluid based on the Landau
critical-velocity criterion will be discussed.

state of the algebra of the canonical commutation relations (CCR-algebra) and a
squeezed quasifree state. Applications of this formula are made for the case of
multimode thermal squeezed states of quantum optics using a general canonical
decomposition of the correlation matrix valid for any quasifree state. In the
particular case of a one mode CCR-algebra we show that the transition
probability between two quasifree squeezed states is a decreasing function of
the geodesic distance between the points of the upper half plane representing
these states. In the special case of the purification map it is shown that the
transition probability between the state of the enlarged system and the product
state of real and fictitious subsystems can be a measure for the entanglement.
