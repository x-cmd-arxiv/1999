small solid angle the optical depth due to dust is very large. We consider two
types of flows. In the first, small cool spots are formed on the surface of
slowly rotating AGB stars. During the last AGB phase when mass loss rate is
high, the dust shields the region above it from the stellar radiation. This
leads to both further dust formation in the shaded region, and the convergence
of the stream toward the shaded region. A concentration of magnetic cool spots
toward the equator will lead to a density contrast of up to a few between the
equatorial and polar directions. This process can explain the positive
correlation between high mass loss rate and a larger departure from sphericity
in progenitors of elliptical planetary nebulae. In the second type of flow, the
high density in the equatorial plane is formed by a binary interaction, where
the secondary star is close to, but outside the AGB envelope. The shielding of
the radiation by dust results in a very slow and dense flow in the equatorial
plane. We suggest this flow as an alternative explanation for the equatorial
dense matter found at several hundred astronomical units around several
post-AGB binary systems.

using the multi-phase model of interstellar medium. The typical timescale of
the phase change of an interstellar gas is $\sim 10^7$--$10^8$ yr in spiral
galaxies. Since the phase transition changes the filling factor of the cold gas
where the dust growth occurs, the dust growth rate varies on that timescale. In
order to examine the response of the dust-to-gas ratio to the phase transition,
we construct a model of the time evolution of the dust-to-gas ratio. We adopt
the three phase model for the interstellar gas and the Ikeuchi-Tomita model for
the mass exchange among the phases. According to the model, three types of
solutions are possible: [1] all the gas is transformed to a hot gas; [2] a
stable stationary state of three phases is realized; [3] the filling factor of
each phase cyclically changes. For each of the three types of solutions, the
dust-to-gas ratio behaves as follows: [1] almost all the dust is destroyed (the
dust-to-gas ratio becomes $\sim 0$); [2] the dust-to-gas ratio converges to a
stationary state; [3] the dust-to-gas ratio varies cyclically in response to
the phase transition. In the case of [3], the amplitude of the variation of the
dust-to-gas ratio is large (nearly an order of magnitude) if the dust growth
timescale is shorter than the phase transition timescale. This condition is
easily satisfied in spiral galaxies. However, it is difficult for dwarf
galaxies to realize the condition because their small metallicity makes the
dust growth timescale long.

investigated by means of density functional theory and by Monte Carlo
simulation for a Lennard-Jones fluid. Our work was stimulated by recent
experiments for SF_6 adsorbed in a mesoporous glass which showed the striking
phenomenon of critical depletion, i.e. the adsorption excess ""Gamma"" first
increases but then decreases very rapidly to negative values as the bulk
critical temperature T_c is approached from above along near-critical
isochores. By contrast, our density functional and simulation results, for a
range of strongly attractive wall-fluid potentials, show Gamma monotonically
increasing and eventually saturating as the temperature is lowered towards T_c
along both the critical (rho=rho_c) and sub-critical isochores (rho<\rho_c).
Such behaviour results from the increasingly slow decay of the density profile
away from the walls, into the middle of the slit, as T->T_c. For rho < rho_c we
find that in the fluid the effective bulk field, which is negative and which
favours desorption, is insufficient to dominate the effects of the surface
fields which favour adsorption. We compare this situation with earlier results
for the lattice gas model with a constant (negative) bulk field where critical
depletion was found. Qualitatively different behaviour of the density profiles
and adsorption is found in simulations for intermediate and weakly attractive
wall-fluid potentials but in no case do we observe the critical depletion found
in experiments. We conclude that the latter cannot be accounted for by a single
pore model.

the existence of two different temperature scales. A spin gap in the
intermediate regime leads to exponential drop of the spin susceptibility at low
temperatures. Unusual scaling of spin susceptibility is found for temperatures
above 0.6 J. Charge susceptibility at finite doping reveals existence of heavy
quasiparticles. A new low energy scale is found at finite doping.

the `quantum interest rate' and on the maximum delay between a negative pulse

two problematical issues in cosmic string physics. Helicity, the space integral
of the scalar product of a velocity-like field with its vorticity field (curl),
can be defined for a complex scalar field in analogy with fluids. We dwell on
the topological interpretation of helicity as related to the linking of field
lines of the vorticity field. Earlier works failed to fully implement this
interpretation for cosmic strings by missing a term connected with the linking
of these lines inside the strings. As a result paradoxical conclusions were
drawn: global cosmic string loops may not take on certain simple shapes, and
baryon number is not quantized in integers in the presence of local cosmic
strings in gauge theory. We show that both paradoxes are removed when internal
contributions to helicity are properly taken into account. In particular,
quantization of baryon number can be understood within a special case of the
Glashow-Weinberg-Salam model if cosmic strings are the unique mechanism for
baryosynthesis. In addition, we find a new constraint on the permitted linkages
of cosmic strings in a string tangle.

itself viewed as a bi-module with the left (resp. right) action of the
enveloping algebra P^e \simeq P\otimes P^T on P. The isomorphism established in
this article and given by Daviau's map does clearly show that right and left
actions are of similar type. This should be compared with attempts of Hestenes,
Daviau and others to interprete the right action as the iso-spin freedom.

  Finiteness","AMS-TeX, 4 pages",,,,"math.DG math.GT",,"  Our main result asserts that for any given numbers C and D the class of
simply connected closed smooth manifolds of dimension m<7 which admit a
Riemannian metric with sectional curvature bounded in absolute value by C and
diameter uniformly bounded from above by D contains only finitely many
diffeomorphism types. Thus in these dimensions the lower positive bound on
volume in Cheeger's Finiteness Theorem can be replaced by a purely topological
condition, simply-connectedness. In dimension 4 instead of simply-connectedness
here only non-vanishing of the Euler characteristic has to be required.
  As a topological corollary we obtain that for k+l<7 there are over a given
smooth closed l-manifold only finitely many principal $T^k$ bundles with simply
connected and non-diffeomorphic total spaces.
  Furthermore, for any given numbers C and D and any dimension m it is shown
that for each natural number i there are up to isomorphism always only finitely
many possibilities for the i-th homotopy group of a simply connected closed
m-manifold which admits a metric with sectional curvature bounded in absolute

  Math. Notes","Math. Notes 63 (1998), no. 1-2, 225-232",,,"math.AT",,"  We refer to an action of the group Z/p (p here is an odd prime) on a stably
complex manifold as simple if all its fixed submanifolds have the trivial
normal bundle. The important particular case of a simple action is an action
with only isolated fixed points. The problem of cobordism classification of
manifolds with simple action of Z/p was posed by V.M.Buchstaber and S.P.Novikov
in 1971. The analogous question of cobordism classification with stricter
conditions on Z/p-action was answered by Conner and Floyd. Namely, Conner and
Floyd solved the problem in the case of simple actions with identical sets of
weights (eigenvalues of the differential of the map corresponding to the
generator of Z/p) for all fixed submanifolds of same dimension. However, the
general setting of the problem remained unsolved and is the subject of our
present paper. We have obtained the description of the set of cobordism classes
of stably complex manifolds with simple Z/p-action both in terms of the
coefficients of universal formal group law and in terms of the characteristic
numbers, which gives the complete solution to the above problem. In particular,
this gives a purely cohomological obstruction to the existence of a simple
Z/p-action (or an action with isolated fixed points) on a manifold. We also
review connections with the Conner-Floyd results and with the well-known
Stong-Hattori theorem.

separation of potential fields peculiar to the slow quasi-static waves. It is
shown that the orthogonal complementary fields appearing inside the external
source region are just associated with a contribution of the potential fields
inherent in exciting sources. Taking account of medium losses converts the
usual orthogonality relation into a novel form called the quasi-orthogonality
relation. It is found that the separation of potential fields reveals the fine
structure of interaction between the exciting sources and mode eigenfields: in
addition to the exciting currents interacting with the curl fields, the
exciting charges and the double charge (surface dipole) layers appear to
interact with the quasi-static potentials and the displacement currents,
