  MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03038.x",,"astro-ph",,"  We consider a model for quasar formation in which massive black holes are
formed and fuelled largely by the accretion of hot gas during the process of
galaxy formation. In standard hierarchical collapse models, objects about the
size of normal galaxies and larger form a dense hot atmosphere when they
collapse. We show that if such an atmosphere forms a nearly ""maximal"" cooling
flow, then a central black hole can accrete at close to its Eddington limit.
This leads to exponential growth of a seed black hole, resulting in a quasar in
some cases. In this model, the first quasars form soon after the first
collapses to produce hot gas. The hot gas is depleted as time progresses,
mostly by cooling, so that the accretion rate eventually falls below the
threshold for advection-dominated accretion, at which stage radiative
efficiency plummets and any quasar turns off. A simple implementation of this
model, incorporated into a semi-analytical model for galaxy formation,
over-produces quasars when compared with observed luminosity functions, but is
consistent with models of the X-ray Background which indicate that most
accretion is obscured. It produces few quasars at high redshift due to the lack
of time needed to grow massive black holes. Quasar fuelling by hot gas provides
a minimum level, sufficient to power most quasars at redshifts between one and
two, to which other sources of fuel can be added. The results are sensitive to
feedback effects, such as might be due to radio jets and other outflows.

intrinsic properties of the accreting black hole system also must play a role
in determining the appearance of such an object. In addition to mass and
accretion rate, the angular momentum (or spin) of the black hole can play a
crucial role in determining the power of a relativistic jet that is generated
by magnetohydrodynamic acceleration near the hole. In this paper a scenario is
presented, based on accretion theory and recent models of MHD jet production,
in which the primary (although not only) parameter differentiating between
radio loud and quiet objects is the black hole spin, and that determining
quasar vs. radio galaxy is the accretion rate. A surprising number of desirable
features result from these simple concepts and the accompanying equations. In
addition, there are several testable predictions that can determine whether
this grand unification scheme has further merit.

comparable with those of single stellar populations (SSPs) of approximately
solar abundance or above. Negative radial gradients are observed in
line-strengths, similar to those in elliptical galaxies. The bulge data are
consistent with correlations between Mg2, and central velocity dispersion
observed in elliptical galaxiess. In contrast to elliptical galaxies, central
line-strengths lie within the loci defining the range of <Fe> and Mg2 achieved
by Worthey's (1994) solar abundance ratio, SSPs. The implication of solar
abundance ratios indicates differences in the star formation histories of
spiral bulges and elliptical galaxies. A ``single zone with in- fall'' model of
galactic chemical evolution, using Worthey's (1994) SSPs, is used to constrain
possible star formation histories in our sample. We show that <Fe>, Mg2 and
Hbeta line-strengths observed in these bulges cannot be reproduced using
primordial collapse models of formation but can be reproduced by models with
extended in-fall of gas and star formation (2-17 Gyr) in the region modelled.

a velocity range of >1000 km/sec. It consists of two distinct features with
FWHM of >= 550 km/sec and ~150 km/sec and line centers separated by >=700

matter fluctuations. We use high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations in cold
dark matter dominated cosmological models. In models with a hotter
intergalactic medium (IGM), the increased temperature enhances the pressure
gradients between low and high density regions and this changes the spatial
distribution and the velocity field of the gas. Combined with more thermal
broadening, this leads to significantly wider absorption features in hotter
models. Cosmological models with little small scale power also have broader
absorption features, because fluctuations on the scale of the Jeans length are
still in the linear regime . Consequently, both the amplitude of dark matter
fluctuations on small scales and thermal smoothing affect the flux decrement
distribution in a similar way. However, the b-parameter distribution of Voigt
profile fits, obtained by deblending the absorption features into a sum of
thermally broadened lines, is largely independent of the amount of small scale
power, but does depend strongly on the IGM temperature. The same is true for
the two-point function of the flux and for the flux power spectrum on small
scales. These three flux statistics are thus sensitive probes of the
temperature of the IGM. We compare them computed for our models and obtained
from a HIRES spectrum of the quasar Q1422+231 and conclude that the IGM
temperature at z=3.25 is fairly high, T_0>= 15000K.

telemetry allocation. This limitation could reduce the amount of diagnostics
sent on the stability of the radiometers and, as a consequence, curb the final
sensitivity of the CMB anisotropy maps. Our proposal to address this problem
consists in taking differences of consecutive circles at a given sky pointing.
To a good approximation, these differences are independent of the external
signal, and are dominated by thermal (white) instrumental noise. Using
simulations and analytical predictions we show that high compression rates,
$c_r \simeq 10$, can be obtained with minor or zero loss of CMB sensitivity.
Possible effects of digital distortion are also analized. The proposed scheme
allows for flexibility to optimize the relation with other critical aspects of
the mission. Thus, this study constitutes an important step towards a more
realistic modeling of the final sensitivity of the CMB temperature anisotropy
maps.

report that the SP transition is reentrant in the vicinity of the critical

superlattice peaks below the reentrance temperature, T_r, which may mean either
the complete loss of the long-range SP order or the development of a
short-range ordered component within the long-range ordered SP state. Marked
hysteresis and very large relaxation times are found in the samples with Mg

related to the competing Neel transition which occurs at a temperature similar

embedded in the antiferromagnetic host, resulting in percolative conduction
paths. This phase separation is not a charge segregation type, but a
electroneutral type. The magnetoresistance peak at the temperature where
percolative paths start to form provides a direct evidence that phase
separation is one source of colossal magnetoresistance effect.

antiferrodistorsive ordering of Jahn-Teller deformed MnO_6 octahedra. This
allows to study not only the influence of the spin configuration on the
magneto-transport properties (CMR effect) but also the role of orbital order
and disorder. The orbital ordering transition (at 269 K in zero magnetic field)
causes a doubling of the resistivity (regardless of the CMR effect in applied
magnetic fields) and a drop of the paramagnetic susceptibility. The latter
might be interpreted in terms of a shrinking of spin polarons. External
magnetic fields shift the ordering transition to lower temperatures according
to the field-induced decrease of the carrier localization. The magnetic field -
temperature phase boundary line was investigated by means of magnetoresistance
(up to 12 T) and pulsed-fields magnetization measurements up to 50 T. The
pronounced magnetization anomalies, associated with the phase transition,
vanish for fields exceeding 20 T. This behaviour has been attributed to a
field-induced crossover from antiferrodistorsive order to a
nondistorsive/ferromagnetic orbital configuration.

  Postscript figures, uses graphics.sty and dalthesis.sty",,,"DAL-99-0803","gr-qc hep-th",,"  The asymptotic behaviour of two classes of scalar field cosmological models
are studied using the theory of dynamical systems: general relativistic Bianchi
models containing matter and a scalar field with an exponential potential and a
class of spatially homogeneous string cosmological models. The purpose of this
thesis is to examine some of the outstanding problems which currently exist in
cosmology, particularly regarding isotropization and inflation. It is shown
that the matter scaling solutions are unstable to curvature perturbations. It
is then shown that the Bianchi class B exponential potential models can
alleviate the isotropy problem; an open set of models within this class do
isotropize to the future. It is also shown that the presence of an interaction
term in the subclass of isotropic models can lead to inflationary models with
late-time oscillatory behaviour in which the matter is not driven to zero.
Next, within the class of the string cosmologies studied, it is shown that
there is a subclass which do not inflate at late times in the post-big bang
regime. Furthermore, all string models studied typically do not have a
late--time flatness problem. Indeed, it is shown that curvature typically plays
an important r\^{o}le only at intermediate times in most models. It is also
shown that the presence of a positive cosmological constant in the models
studied can lead to interesting physical behaviour, such as multi-bouncing
universes. A mathematical equivalence between general relativistic scalar field
theories and scalar-tensor theories and string theories has been extensively
exploited and thus the results obtained from the string analysis compliment the
results obtained from the Bianchi class B exponential potential analysis.

is introduced. No deviation from the Einstein General Relativity prediction for
the deflection angle for photons grazing the Sun in the visible band with 15%
accuracy (90% c.l.) implies that the scale M_S has to be larger than
1.4(2/(n-2))^{1/4} TeV and approximately 4 TeV for n=2. This lower bound is
comparable with that from collider physics constraints. Gravitational lensing
experiments with higher energy photons can provide stronger constraints.

unambiguously by the D3-brane DBI action. By calculating absorption
cross-sections of all partial waves of the dilaton we find corresponding

of the main properties of the N=4 SYM theory under consideration. Original
results are reported in chapters 3, 4 and 5. A systematic re-analysis of the
perturbative properties of the theory is presented in the third chapter. Two-,
three- and four-point Green functions of elementary fields are computed using
the component formulation and/or the superfield approach and subtleties related
to the gauge-fixing are pointed out. In the fourth chapter, after an
introduction to instanton calculus in supersymmetric gauge theories, the
computation of the one-instanton contributions to Green functions of gauge
invariant composite operators in the semiclassical approximation is reported.
The calculations of four-, eight- and sixteen-point Green functions of
operators in the supercurrent multiplet are reviewed in detail. The final
chapter is devoted to the AdS/SCFT correspondence. Some general aspects are
discussed. Then the attention is focused on the relation between instantons in
N=4 SYM and D-instanton effects in type IIB string theory. The comparison
between instanton contributions to Green functions of composite operators in
the boundary field theory and D-instanton generated terms in the amplitudes
computed in type IIB string theory is performed and agreement between these two
sources of non-perturbative effects is shown.

NN cross section of sigma_eff=54.2+-5.0mb (compared to the free space value
sigma_in=30mb) and is interpreted as one related to wounded target nucleons.

polarization opens a number of exciting opportunities in fundamental neutron
physics and in neutron scattering. At the LANSCE pulsed neutron source we have
measured the neutron beam polarization with absolute accuracy of 0.3% in the
neutron energy range from 40 meV to 10 eV using an optically-pumped polarized
3He spin filter and a relative transmission measurement technique. 3He was
polarized using the Rb spin-exchange method. We describe the measurement
technique, present our results, and discuss some of the systematic effects
associated with the method.

laser-cooled xenon atoms. The charge carrier density is as high as 2 x 10^9
cm^-3, and the temperatures of electrons and ions are as low as 100 mK and 10
uK, respectively. Plasma behavior is evident in the trapping of electrons by
the positive ion cloud when the Debye screening length becomes smaller than the
size of the sample. We produce plasmas with parameters such that both electrons
and ions are strongly coupled.

"physics/9908052","Douglas J. Keenan","Douglas J. Keenan","The three-century climatic upheaval of c. 2000 BC, and regional
  radiocarbon disparities","34 pages, 2 figures; as presented at IUGG99, with minor technical
  revisions","Radiocarbon 44: 225-237 [2002] (for the section on radiocarbon
  disparities only)",,,"physics.geo-ph physics.ao-ph",,"  Several researchers have previously identified a severe climatic upheaval in
tropical North Africa that began just over 4000 years ago and lasted for about
three centuries. The upheaval is known to have occurred shortly after a
volcanic eruption, and companion work proposes that this eruption was colossal.
Here, we suggest how the eruption acted as a trigger for the upheaval: by
forcing changes in ocean circulation; although the initial (atmospheric)
forcing lasted only a few years, the ocean required three centuries to regain
equilibrium. The suggested triggering mechanism is supported by
palaeoceanographic, palaeoecological, and archaeo-historical data and by
related experiments with a (coupled general-circulation) climate model. We
argue that the changes in ocean circulation forced changes in sea-surface
temperatures that led to a weakening of the south-west North African monsoon.
The upheaval has been proposed to have also encompassed south-western Asia. We
argue that it encompassed most of the Northern Hemisphere: we present a variety
of palaeoecological and palaeoceanographic evidence and describe the principal
underlying climatology. In some areas the upheaval was the most severe since
the ice ages. The full scope of the upheaval has previously been missed in part
because radiocarbon dates from some areas are centuries too early:
palaeoclimatic events in different areas thus appeared asynchronous. (The
erroneous radiocarbon dates also misled searches seeking ice-core and tree-ring
evidence of the eruption.) The cause of the radiocarbon-dating disparities is
identified as a regional deficiency in 14C, and we locate the region's source
of 14C-deficient carbon.
