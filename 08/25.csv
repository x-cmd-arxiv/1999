  Intended as an introduction for non-specialists",,"10.1016/S0370-1573(99)00030-7",,"astro-ph",,"  Theories of how galaxies, the fundamental constituents of large-scale
structure, form and evolve have undergone a dramatic paradigm shift in the last
few decades. Earlier views were of rapid, early collapse and formation of basic
structures, followed by slow evolution of the stellar populations and steady
buildup of the chemical elements. Current theories emphasize hierarchical
buildup via recurrent collisions and mergers, separated by long periods of
relaxation and secular restructuring. Thus, collisions between galaxies are now
seen as a primary process in their evolution. This article begins with a brief
history; we then tour parts of the vast array of collisional forms that have
been discovered to date. Many examples are provided to illustrate how detailed
numerical models and multiwaveband observations have allowed the general
chronological sequence of collisional morphologies to be deciphered, and how
these forms are produced by the processes of tidal kinematics, hypersonic gas
dynamics, collective dynamical friction and violent relaxation. Galaxy
collisions may trigger the formation of a large fraction of all the stars ever
formed, and play a key role in fueling active galactic nuclei. Current
understanding of the processes involved is reviewed. The last decade has seen
exciting new discoveries about how collisions are orchestrated by their
environment, how collisional processes depend on environment, and how these
environments depend on redshift or cosmological time.

model for the interpretation of GRB afterglows emerged involving synchrotron
emission from a constant energy blast wave expanding into a constant density,
``interstellar'' medium. However, a massive star origin for GRBs implies a
stellar wind environment, probably a Wolf-Rayet star, and we have previously
suggested wind interaction models for the afterglows of GRBs 980326, 980519,
and 980425/SN 1998bw. Here, we extend the theory of afterglows in winds,
considering strong cooling phases, the transition to nonrelativistic motion,
jets, and prompt, reverse shock emission. We find that, compared to the
interstellar case, the optical prompt emission in the wind case could have a
comparable magnitude, but would die off faster. We examine the afterglows of
other well-observed GRBs in the context of wind interaction models, and find
that GRBs 970228 and 970508 are likely wind interactors. The revision in the
nonthermal afterglow emission from GRB 970228 caused by the recognition of late
supernova emission favors wind interaction. The radio evolution of GRB 970508
provides especially strong evidence for wind interaction. For GRB 970508, the
observations suggest a density that is compatible with that expected in a
Wolf-Rayet star wind. Finally, observations of the afterglow evolution of GRBs
990123 and 990510 and the prompt optical emission from GRB 990123 favor
interstellar interaction models, which would suggest compact star merger
progenitors for these objects.

order to reduce the total GRB energy, thus it is very important to look for the
observational evidence of beaming. Rhoads (1999) has pointed out that the
dynamics of the blast wave, which is formed when the beamed ejecta sweeping the
external medium, will be significantly modified by the sideways expansion due
to the increased swept up matter. He claimed that shortly after the bulk
Lorentz factor ($\Gamma $) of the blast wave drops below the inverse of the
initial opening angle ($\theta_{0}$) of the beamed ejecta, there will be a
sharp break in the afterglow light curves. However, some other authors have
performed numerical calculations and shown that the break of the light curve is
weaker and much smoother than the one analytically predicted. In this paper we
reanalyse the dynamical evolution of the jet blast wave, calculate the jet
emission analytically, we find that the sharp break predicted by Rhoads will
actually not exist, and for most cases the afterglow light curve will almost
not be affected by sideways expansion unless the beaming angle is extremely
small. We demonstrate that only when $\theta_{0}<0.1$, the afterglow light
curves may be steepened by sideways expansion, and in fact there cannot be two
breaks as claimed before. We have also constructed a simple numerical code to
verify our conclusion.

and spectral analyses, can add strict constraints to gamma-ray burst (GRB)
models. In previous studies, the lag analysis focused on the lags between
channel 1 (25-57 keV) and channel 3 (115-320 keV) from the Burst and Transient
Source Experiment (BATSE). In this paper, we analyzed the cross-correlation
average lags (including approximate uncertainties) between energy bands for two
GRB samples: 19 events detected by Ginga, and 109 events detected by BATSE. We
paid special attention to the BATSE GRBs with known redshifts, because there
has been a reported connection between lag and luminosity. This extends our
knowledge of spectral lags to lower energy ($\sim 2$ keV). We found that lags
between energy bands are small. The lag between the peak of $\sim 50$ keV
photons and $\sim 200$ keV photons is $\sim 0.08$ sec. The upper limit in the
lag between $\sim 9$ keV photons and $\sim 90$ keV photons is $\sim 0.5$ sec.
Thus, there are not large shifts at low energy. We found that about 20% of GRBs
have detectable lags between energy bands in the Ginga and BATSE samples. From
the internal shock model there are three sources of time structure in GRB
pulses: cooling, hydrodynamics, and angular effects. We argue that cooling is
much too fast to account for our observed lags and angular effects are energy
independent. Thus, only hydrodynamics can produce these lags. Perhaps the
radiation process varies as the reverse shock moves through the shell.

strong coupling (SC) states (for r < 1) and local moment (LM) states (for r >
1), with characteristic signatures in both spectral properties and
thermodynamic functions. Second, we establish general conditions upon the
interaction self-energy for the occurence of a SC state for U > 0. This leads
to a pinning theorem, whereby the modified spectral function is pinned at the
Fermi level for any U where a SC state exists; it generalizes to arbitrary r
the familiar pinning condition for the normal r = 0 Anderson model. Finally, we
consider explicitly spectral functions at the simplest level: second order
perturbation theory in U, which we conclude is applicable for r < 1/2 and r > 1

present implementation of the spin-orbit coupling is discussed, where
especially the 6p states pose a difficulty. The observed discrepancy (0-10%)
between the FP-LMTO calculations and the recent FP-LAPW calculation of Jones

calculations. We argue that the choice of a constant muffin-tin radius, common
for all calculated volumes, is less satisfactory compared to the choice of a
muffin-tin radius that scales with the volume, especially when a large volume
interval and open packed structures are considered. The conclusion of Jones et

erroneous.

symmetric Anderson impurity model (AIM), with a soft-gap hybridization
vanishing at the Fermi level with a power law r > 0. Local moments are
introduced explicitly from the outset, and a two-self-energy description is
employed in which the single-particle excitations are coupled dynamically to
low-energy transverse spin fluctuations. The resultant theory is applicable on
all energy scales, and captures both the spin-fluctuation regime of strong
coupling (large-U), as well as the weak coupling regime. While the primary
emphasis is on single particle dynamics, the quantum phase transition between
strong coupling (SC) and (LM) phases can also be addressed directly; for the
spin-fluctuation regime in particular a number of asymptotically exact results
are thereby obtained. Results for both single-particle spectra and SC/LM phase
boundaries are found to agree well with recent numerical renormalization group
(NRG) studies. A number of further testable predictions are made; in
particular, for r < 1/2, spectra characteristic of the SC state are predicted
to exhibit an r-dependent universal scaling form as the SC/LM phase boundary is
approached and the Kondo scale vanishes. Results for the `normal' r = 0 AIM are
moreover recovered smoothly from the limit r -> 0, where the resultant
description of single-particle dynamics includes recovery of Doniach-Sunjic
tails in the Kondo resonance, as well as characteristic low-energy Fermi liquid
behaviour.

tunnelling with tunnelling relaxation occurring from levels of progressively

the binding energy of excitons in the wire, which breaks translational

binding energy is shown to approximately compensate for bandgap

constant with n_e, in agreement with experiment. We find that the nature of
screening, as treated within our non-linear model, is significantly different

free carrier states with the bound electron states has a profound effect on the

systems which may undergo incommensurate-commensurate or (for an accidentally
commensurate wavevector) lock-in transitions. In particular, an intermediate
floating phase with algebraically decaying correlations exists only in D=2
dimensions, whereas in higher dimensions most features of the phase diagram are
mean-field like.
  Here we will show, that the introduction of frozen-in disorder leads to
strong fluctuation effects even in D<4 dimensions. For commensurate wavevectors
the lattice pinning potential dominates always over weak impurity pinning if p
\le p_c=6/\pi (D=3), where p denotes the degeneracy of the commensurate phase.
For larger p a disorder driven continuous transition between a long-range
ordered locked-in phase and quasi-long-range ordered phase, dominated by
impurity pinning, occurs. Critical exponents of this transition, which is
characterized by a zero temperature fixed point, are calculated within an
expansion in 4-D. The generalization to incommensurate wavevectors will be
discussed. If the modulation in the quasi-long-range ordered phase has
hexagonal symmetry, as e.g.for flux-line lattices, the algebraic decay is
non-universal and depends on the Poisson ratio of the elastic constants. Weakly
driven transport is dominated by thermally activated creep in both phases, but

In our derivation, the Dirac bracket structure with respect to the primary
constraints appears naturally and plays an important role in the
characterization of the conserved quantities associated to these Noether
symmetries. The issue of projectability of these symmetries from tangent space
to phase space is fully analyzed, and we give a geometrical interpretation of
the projectability conditions in terms of a relation between the Noether
conserved quantity in tangent space and the presymplectic form defined on it.
We also examine the enlarged formalism that results from taking the Lagrange
multipliers as new dynamical variables; we find the equation that characterizes
the Noether symmetries in this formalism. The algebra of generators for Noether
symmetries is discussed in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms. We
find that a frequent source for the appearance of open algebras is the fact
that the transformations of momenta in phase space and tangent space only
coincide on shell. Our results apply with no distinction to rigid and gauge
symmetries; for the latter case we give a general proof of existence of Noether
gauge symmetries for theories with first and second class constraints that do
not exhibit tertiary constraints in the stabilization algorithm. Among some
examples that illustrate our results, we study the Noether gauge symmetries of
the Abelian Chern-Simons theory in $2n+1$ dimensions. An interesting feature of
this example is that its primary constraints can only be identified after the
determination of the secondary constraint. The example is worked out retaining

the most striking facts to emerge from the AdS/CFT correspondence. A two-fold
puzzle appears in the extremal case, e.g. k_1 = k_2 + k_3. First, the
supergravity calculation involves analytic continuation in the k_i variables to
define the product of a vanishing bulk coupling and an infinite integral over
AdS. Second, extremal correlators are uniquely sensitive to mixing of the
single-trace operators $tr X^k$ with protected multi-trace operators in the
same representation of SU(4). We show that the calculation of extremal
correlators from supergravity is subject to the same subtlety of regularization
known for the 2-point functions, and we present a careful method which
justifies the analytic continuation and shows that supergravity fields couple
to single traces without admixture. We also study extremal n-point functions of
chiral primary operators, and argue that Type IIB supergravity requires that
their space-time form is a product of n-1 two-point functions (as in the free
field approximation) multiplied by a non-renormalized coefficient. This
non-renormalization property of extremal n-point functions is a new prediction
of the AdS/CFT correspondence. As a byproduct of this work we obtain the cubic

to lead to physical states that rapidly converge in an expansion in
free-particle Fock-space sectors. To make this possible, we use light-front
field theory to isolate vacuum effects, and we place a smooth cutoff on the
Hamiltonian to force its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the
difference of the free masses of the states increases. The cutoff violates a
number of physical principles of light-front field theory, including Lorentz
covariance and gauge covariance. This means that the operators in the
Hamiltonian are not required to respect these physical principles. However, by
requiring the Hamiltonian to produce cutoff-independent physical quantities and
by requiring it to respect the unviolated physical principles of the theory, we
are able to derive recursion relations that define the Hamiltonian to all
orders in perturbation theory in terms of the fundamental parameters of the
field theory. We present two applications of this method. First we work in
massless phi-cubed theory in six dimensions. We derive the recursion relations
that determine the Hamiltonian and demonstrate how they are used by computing
and analyzing some of its second- and third-order matrix elements. Then we
apply our method to pure-glue quantum chromodynamics. After deriving the
recursion relations for this theory, we use them to calculate to second order
the part of the Hamiltonian that is required to compute the spectrum. We
diagonalize the Hamiltonian using basis-function expansions for the gluons'
color, spin, and momentum degrees of freedom. We analyze our results for the

analysed using singularity theory and stability theory. It is shown that the
stationary-state bifurcation sets have qualitative properties identical to
standard normal forms for the pitchfork and transcritical bifurcations. The
analysis yields the codimension of the highest-order singularities, from which
we find that the unperturbed systems are overdetermined bifurcation problems
and derive appropriate universal unfoldings. Questions of mutual equivalence
and the character of the state transitions are addressed.

in the context of non-extensive thermodynamics. A trial density matrix,
obtained by heuristic methods, is proved to be the equilibrium density matrix.
If the entropic parameter q is larger than 1 then existence of the trial
equilibrium density matrix requires that q is less than some critical value q_c
which depends on the rate by which the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian diverge.
Existence of a unique equilibrium density matrix is proved if in addition q<2
holds. For q between 0 and 1, such that 2<q+q_c, the free energy has at least
one minimum in the set of trial density matrices. If a unique equilibrium
density matrix exists then it is necessarily one of the trial density matrices.
Note that this is a finite rank operator, which means that in equilibrium high
energy levels have zero probability of occupancy.

Spanning is proved via a new straightening algorithm for expanding elements of
the representation into this basis. For skew shapes, this algorithm specializes
to the classical straightening law. The new straight basis is used to produce
bases for flagged Schur and Weyl modules, to provide Groebner and sagbi bases
for the homogeneous coordinate rings of some configuration varieties and to
produce a flagged branching rule for row-convex representations. Systematic use
of supersymmetric letterplace techniques enables the representation theoretic
results to be applied to representations of the general linear Lie superalgebra

  Effect","40 pages, 5 figures, html and gif, Note added in Appendix and

well known physics is possible theoretically. To do that, it is proposed to use
two specific time-varying and constrained distributions of electric charges
which own a symmetry axis and are adequately separated in space. Total charge
of each distribution is zero. With a relative temporal phase-shift between
them, an asymmetry into the far fields momentum variation rate distribution
along the symmetry axis can be induced. Consequently, an electromagnetic
propulsive force is generated and applied over both charge distributions in a
same direction along the axis-say. Magnetic part of this force is dissipative
because closely related to energy lost by radiation. But its electric
counterpart gives a conservative contribution to the propulsive force with no
associated energy losses at zero velocity. Momentum conservation law for the
entire system; the two charge distributions and fields, is respected because
all far fields; radiation ones and relativistic correction one, are taken into
account. If radiation and other energy losses could be minimized, such a
conservative propulsive force could help to realize fast and long space
journeys.

of view that distinguishes between the observable consequences and the
``symmetrization postulate''. In particular, we make a critical analysis of
concepts of particle identity, state distinguishability and permutation, and
particle ``labels''. We discuss how to construct unique state vectors and the
nature of the full state descriptions required for this -- in particular the
elimination of arbitrary $2\pi$ rotations on fermion spin quantization frames
and argue that the failure to do this renders the conventional symmetrization
postulate (and previous ``proofs'' of it) at best {\em incomplete}.
  We discuss particle permutation in a general way for any pairs of particles,
whether identical or not, and make an essential distinction between exchange
and pure permutation. We prove a revised symmetrization postulate that allows
us to construct state vectors that are naturally symmetric under pure
permutation, {\em for any spin}. The significance of particle labels (which, in
the exchange operation, are not permuted along with other variables) is then
that they stand in for any asymmetry (order dependence) that is present in the
full state descriptions necessary for unique state vectors but not explicit in
the regular state variables. {\em The exchange operation is then the physical
transformation that reverses any asymmetry implicit in the labels}.
  We point out a previously unremarked geometrical asymmetry between all pairs
of particles that is present whenever we choose a common frame of reference. We
compute the exchange phase for various state vectors using different spin
quantization frames, and prove the Pauli Exclusion Principle and its
generalization to arbitrary spin.
