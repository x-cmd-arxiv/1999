monochromatic photon beam and relativistic electrons is revisited and formally
solved without approximations. Solutions are given for the single scattering
with an electron beam and with a population of electrons isotropically
distributed, under the assumption that the energy distribution of the
relativistic particles follows a simple power law as it is the case in many
astrophysical applications. Both the Thomson approximation and the
Klein-Nishina regime are considered for the scattering of an unpolarized photon
beam. The equations are obtained without the ultra-relativistic approximation
and are compared with the ultra-relativistic solutions given in the literature.
The main characteristics of the power distribution and spectra of the scattered
radiation are discussed for relevant examples. In the Thomson case for an
isotropic electron population simple formulae holding down to
mildly-relativistic energies are given. As an application the formulae of the
anisotropic inverse Compton scattering are used to predict the properties of
the X and $\gamma$-ray spectra from the radio lobes of strong FR II radio
galaxies due to the interaction of the relativistic electrons with the incoming
photons from the nucleus. The dependence of the emitted power on the
relativistic electron energy distribution and on its evolution with time is
discussed.

motions of galaxies. The great distances to which SNe Ia can be seen makes them
particularly well-suited to constraining large-scale velocity flows. The high
precision of SN Ia distance measurements limits the contamination of such
measurements by Malmquist or sample selection biases. I review the recent use
of SNe Ia to measure the motion of the Local Group (updated to include 44 SNe
Ia). The direction of the best-fit motion remains consistent with that inferred
from the CMB (though modest bulk flows cannot be ruled out) and inconsistent
with the Lauer-Postman frame. Comparisons between SN Ia peculiar velocities and
gravity maps from IRAS and ORS galaxies yields constraints on the mass density
which gives rise to the gravitationally induced peculiar motions. Indications
are for $\beta$=0.4 from IRAS, and 0.3 from the ORS, with $\beta>0.7$ and
$\beta<0.15$ ruled out at 95% confidence levels from the IRAS comparison. The
contributions of SNe Ia to peculiar velocity studies are limited by statistics,
but the great increase in the recent discovery rate suggests SNe Ia may become
increasingly important in constraining flows.

detected reflection nebulosities show elongation, and the nebula morphology
bifurcates depending on the degree of the central star obscuration. The
Star-Obvious Low-level-Elongated (SOLE) nebulae show a bright central star
embedded in a faint, extended nebulosity, whereas the DUst-Prominent
Longitudinally-EXtended (DUPLEX) nebulae have remarkable bipolar structure with
a completely or partially obscured central star. The intrinsic axisymmetry of
these proto-planetary nebula reflection nebulosities demonstrates that the
axisymmetry frequently found in planetary nebulae predates the proto-planetary
nebula phase, confirming previous independent results. We suggest that
axisymmetry in proto-planetary nebulae is created by an equatorially enhanced
superwind at the end of the asymptotic giant branch phase. We discuss that the
apparent morphological dichotomy is caused by a difference in the optical
thickness of the circumstellar dust/gas shell with a differing equator-to-pole
density contrast. Moreover, we show that SOLE and DUPLEX nebulae are physically
distinct types of proto-planetary nebulae, with a suggestion that higher mass
progenitor AGB stars are more likely to become DUPLEX proto-planetary nebulae.

of each constituent, using an approximate model of the composite grain. We
assume it consists of many concentric spherical layers of the various
materials, each with a specified volume fraction. In such a case the usual Mie
theory can be generalized and the extinction, scattering, and other cross
sections determined exactly.
  We find that the ordering of the materials in the layering makes some
difference to the derived cross sections, but averaging over the various
permutations of the order of the materials provides rapid convergence as the
number of shells (each of which is filled by all of the materials
proportionately to their volume fractions) is increased. Three shells, each
with one layer of a particular constituent material, give a very satisfactory
estimate of the average cross section produced by larger numbers of shells.
  We give the formulae for the Rayleigh limit (small size parameter) for
multi-layered spheres and use it to propose an ``Effective Medium Theory''

of materials.

attractive picture of logarithmic gauge coupling unification at $10^{16}$ GeV
is seemingly destroyed. In this paper we argue to the contrary that logarithmic
unification {\it can} occur in such theories. The rationale for unification is
no longer that a gauge symmetry is restored at short distances, but rather that
a geometric symmetry is restored at large distances in the bulk away from our
3-brane. The apparent `running' of the gauge couplings to energies far above
the string scale actually arises from the logarithmic variation of classical
fields in (sets of) two large transverse dimensions. We present a number of N=2
and N=1 supersymmetric D-brane constructions illustrating this picture for
unification.

  dynamical r-matrices corresponding to generalized Belavin-Drinfeld triples","18 pages, latex",,,,"math.QA",,"  In early eighties, Belavin and Drinfeld showed that nonskewsymmetric
classical r-matrices for simple Lie algebras are classified by combinatorial
objects which are now called Belavin-Drinfeld triples. Later the second author
of the present paper generalized this result to the case of dynamical
r-matrices, and showed that they correspond to generalized Belavin-Drinfeld
triples. The dynamical r-matrix corresponding a triple is given by a certain
explicit formula, which works for any symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. In
special cases, this formula gives the Felder and the Belavin r-matrix.
  In 1994, Felder associated with every dynamical r-matrix a system of
differential equations called the KZB equations. In the case of the Felder and
Belavin r-matrix, solutions of these equations are known to have a
representation theoretical presentation, as conformal blocks (i.e. traces of
products of intertwining operators between representations of Lie algebras).
  In this paper, we propose such a presentation for ANY dynamical r-matrix
given by the second author's formula. In particular, the paper sheds light on
the Belavin-Drinfeld classical r-matrices of 1984.
  This paper begins a series of papers. In the next paper, joint with
T.Schedler, we will give an explicit quantization of the dynamical r-matrices
for simple Lie algebras (in particular, Belavin-Drinfeld r-matrices), which has
been an open problem for a number of years. In another paper, we plan to
generalize the results of the present paper to quantum groups. This should
yield quantum KZB equations which involve quantum R-matrices obtained by
quantizing the classical r-matrices that appear in this paper.

primary beams. A task force analysis of this subject recommended an
acceleration system capable of 400 MeV/u uranium at 1 particle uA as an
appropriate driver for such a facility. The driver system should be capable of
accelerating lighter ions at higher intensity such that a constant final beam
power (~100kW) is maintained. This document is a more detailed follow on to the
previous analysis of such a system incorporating a cyclotron. The proposed
driver pre-acceleration system consists of an ion source, radio frequency
quadrupole, and linac chain capable of producing a final energy of 30 MeV/u and
a charge (Q) to mass (A) of Q/A ~1/3. This acceleration system would be
followed by a Separated Sector Cyclotron with a final output energy of 400
MeV/u. This system provides a more cost-effective solution in terms of initial
capital investment as well as of operation compared to a fully linac system
with the same primary beam output parameters.

simple general argument, based on the idea that a static source in equal time
coordinates corresponds to a moving source in light front coordinates. This
idea also allows us to solve several simple toy model examples: scalar field in
a box, 1+1 dimensional bag model, three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and the
Hulth\'en potential. The latter provide simplified versions of momentum
distributions and form factors of relevance to experiments. In particular, the
relativistic correction to the mean square radius of a nucleus is shown to be
very small. Solving these simple examples suggests another more general
approach-- the use of tilted light front coordinates. The simple examples are
made even simpler.
