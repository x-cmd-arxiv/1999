supernovae. In the first step, the core collapse of a star with mass $\ge
19M_\odot$ leads to a massive neutron star and a normal supernova, and
subsequently hypercritical accretion of the neutron star from the supernova
ejecta may give rise to a jet through neutrino annihilation and/or Poynting
flux along the stellar rotation axis. However, because of too much surrounding
matter, this jet rapidly enters a nonrelativistic phase and evolves to a large
bubble. In the second step, the neutron star promptly implodes to a rapidly
rotating black hole surrounded by a torus when the mass of the star increases
to the maximum mass and meanwhile its rotation frequency increases to the upper
limit due to the accreted angular momentum. The gravitational binding energy of
the torus may be dissipated by a magnetized relativistic wind, which may then
be absorbed by the supernova ejecta, thus producing an energetic hypernova. The
rotational energy of the black hole may be extracted by the Blandford-Znajek's
mechanism, leading to another jet. This jet is relatively free of baryons and
thus may be accelerated to an ultrarelativistic phase because the first jet has
pushed out of its front matter and left a baryon-free exit. We expect that the
second jet generates a GRB and its afterglow. Our two-step model may alleviate
the baryon-contamination problem suffered possibly from in the hypernova
models. Furthermore, this model not only accounts for association of several
GRBs with supernovae but also explains well the features of the afterglows of
these bursts.

the line asymmetry could have serious effects on inversions for the solar
internal structure and rotation. Here we analyse artificial data based on
simple models of the intrinsic line asymmetry, using GONG mode parameters with
asymmetries found by one of us (Rosenthal \cite{rosenthal2}). By fitting
Lorentzians to the resulting spectra, we estimate the likely properties of the
errors introduced in the frequencies. We discuss whether these frequency shifts
have a form similar to the near-surface layers uncertainties and are therefore
suppressed in the solar structure inversion. We also estimate directly their
contribution, if any, in the solar sound-speed and density determinations using

increase with decreasing luminosity up to a peak at M_I~8.5 or M_H~7 and then
precipitously drop well before photometric incompleteness becomes significant.
Within the observational uncertainties, at M_I~12 or M_H~10.5 (~0.09 Msun) the

synchrotron self-absorbed in these galaxies, but Doppler boosting by
relativistic outflows is not required. Synchrotron self-absorption brightness
temperatures suggest intrinsic source sizes smaller than ~0.05-0.2 pc, for
these four galaxies, the smallest of which corresponds to a light-crossing time

used to measure the internal kinematics of the galaxies. This algorithm has
been tested against the Fourier Fitting method so the data presented here can
be compared with those measured previously in nearby galaxies. We have measured
central velocity dispersions suitable for use in a fundamental plane analysis.
The data have high $S/N$ and the resulting random errors on the dispersions are
very low, typically $<5%$. Uncertainties due to mismatch of the stellar
templates has been minimized through several tests and the total systematic
error is of order $\about 5%$. Good seeing enabled us to measure velocity
dispersion profiles and rotation curves for most of the sample and although a
large fraction of the galaxies display a high level of rotation, the gradients
of the total second moment of the kinematics are all very regular and similar

must not survive mergers with giant ellipticals, despite the fact the small
secondary galaxy can be as much as a million times more dense than the primary.
However, our previous set of experiments has shown that, for purely stellar
galaxies, the secondary does in fact survive mergers with primaries up to 100
times more massive. In this paper, we demonstrate the effect that a massive
central black hole has on mergers of cFP galaxies. Our results indicate that
the addition of a massive central singularity inside the primary galaxy
provides strong enough tidal forces to destroy dense cFP companions when the
secondary's orbital decay is sufficiently elongated. The destruction of the
secondary acts to preserve the original low central density profile of the
primary in the giant merger remnant, which allows the remnant to remain on the
cFP. On more circular orbits, though, the secondary is only disrupted near the
end of the merger, and the degree to which the secondary particles disperse
depends on the amount of orbital energy left in the merger. Hence, there are
some mergers for which the cFP is not preserved in our experiments. We find
that if the secondary is not dispersed, it forms a spinning stellar disk with a
central density that forces the merger remnant off the cFP.

  Journal (scheduled for January 10, 2000)","Astrophys.J.527:918-944,1999","10.1086/308093",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent images of the disks of dust around the young stars HR 4796A and
Fomalhaut show, in each case, a double-lobed feature that may be asymmetric
(one lobe may be brighter than the other). A symmetric double-lobed structure
is that expected from a disk of dust with a central hole that is observed
nearly edge-on (i.e., close to the plane of the disk). This paper shows how the
gravitational influence of a second body in the system with an eccentric orbit
would cause a brightness asymmetry in such a disk by imposing a ""forced
eccentricity"" on the orbits of the constituent dust particles, thus shifting
the center of symmetry of the disk away from the star and causing the dust near
the forced pericenter of the perturbed disk to glow. Dynamic modeling of the HR
4796 disk shows that its 5% brightness asymmetry could be the result of a
forced eccentricity as small as 0.02 imposed on the disk by either the binary
companion HR 4796B, or by an unseen planet close to the inner edge of the disk.
Since it is likely that a forced eccentricity of 0.01 or higher would be
imposed on a disk in a system in which there are planets, but no binary
companion, the corresponding asymmetry in the disk's structure could serve as a
sensitive indicator of these planets that might otherwise remain undetected.

vanishes below 80 K and an inelastic excitation occurs. This directly indicates
the splitting of the Nd3+ ground state Kramers doublet due to the static

temperature dependence below about 4 K. In contrast to the usual monotonous
decrease (increase) of lambda(T) (Ic(T)) with decreasing temperature, lambda(T)

scalar order parameter where the modulated phase is driven by a
gradient-squared term with negative coefficient. For example, theoretical
studies of cholesteric liquid crystals in a field (electric or magnetic)
suggest that such an modulated phase should exist at high chirality. The bulk
phase diagram in the presence of a bulk external field which couples linearly
to the order parameter exhibits a modulated phase inside a loop in the
temperature-field plane, and a homogeneous phase outside. On analyzing the same
model for a semi-infinite system, we find a surprising result; the system
exhibits surface states in a region where the bulk phase is homogeneous (but
close to the modulated region). These states are very different from the
well-known surface states induced either by a surface field or by enhanced
interactions at the surface, for they exist and are energetically favored even
when the sole effect of the surface is to terminate the bulk, as expressed by
free boundary conditions taken at the surface. Near the surface, the
surface-state order parameter is very different from the bulk value (in fact,
it has the opposite sign). When the temperature or the bulk field are varied to
move away from the modulated state, we find a surface phase transition at which
the surface states become energetically unfavorable, though they continue to
exist as metastable states. We then study how a surface field changes the
surface phase diagram.

  quenched disorder: renormalization via traveling waves","86 pages, 15 eps files included",,"10.1016/S0550-3213(00)00468-5",,"cond-mat.dis-nn",,"  We study the two dimensional XY model with quenched random phases and its
Coulomb gas formulation. A novel renormalization group (RG) method is developed
which allows to study perturbatively the glassy low temperature XY phase and
the transition at which frozen topological defects (vortices) proliferate. This
RG approach is constructed both from the replicated Coulomb gas and,
equivalently without the use of replicas, using the probability distribution of
the local disorder (random defect core energy). By taking into account the
fusion of environments (i.e charge fusion in the replicated Coulomb gas) this
distribution is shown to obey a Kolmogorov's type (KPP) non linear RG equation
which admits travelling wave solutions and exhibits a freezing phenomenon
analogous to glassy freezing in Derrida's random energy models. The resulting
physical picture is that the distribution of local disorder becomes broad below
a freezing temperature and that the transition is controlled by rare favorable
regions for the defects, the density of which can be used as the new
perturbative parameter. The determination of marginal directions at the
disorder induced transition is shown to be related to the well studied front
velocity selection problem in the KPP equation and the universality of the
novel critical behaviour obtained here to the known universality of the
corrections to the front velocity. Applications to other two dimensional
problems are mentionned at the end.

N-body dynamical models with infinite-range attractive interactions and without
short distance singularities. The free energy of both models can be exactly
obtained in the canonical ensemble, while microcanonical results can be derived
from numerical simulations. Both models show a phase transition from a low
energy clustered phase to a high energy gaseous state, in analogy with the
models introduced in the early 70's by Thirring and Hertel. The phase
transition is second order for the 1D model, first order for the 2D model.
Negative specific heat appears in both models near the phase transition point.
For both models, in the presence of a negative specific heat, a cluster of
collapsed particles coexists with a halo of higher energy particles which
perform long correlated flights, which lead to anomalous diffusion. The
dynamical origin of the ""superdiffusion"" is different in the two models, being
related to particle trapping and untrapping in the cluster in 1D, while in 2D
the channelling of particles in an egg-crate effective potential is responsible
of the effect. Both models are Lyapunov unstable and the maximal Lyapunov
exponent $\lambda$ has a peak just in the region preceeding the phase
transition. Moreover, in the low energy limit $\lambda$ increases
proportionally to the square root of the internal energy, while in the high
energy region it vanishes as $N^{-1/3}$.

useful quantity which arises naturally in our discussion is the ``relative
Casimir energy"", which we define for a configuration of disjoint conducting
boundaries of arbitrary shapes, as the difference of Casimir energies between
the given configuration and a configuration with the same boundaries infinitely
far apart. Using path integration techniques, we show that the relative Casimir
energy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. This is consistent with a
simple physical argument based on Kirchhoff's law. As a result the ``relative
Casimir entropy"", which we define in an obviously analogous manner, tends, in
the classical limit, to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the
geometry of the boundaries. Thus the Casimir force between disjoint pieces of
the boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a
dimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Contributions
to the Casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected
component of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from
the behavior just described. These logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to
our difficulty to separate the Casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical
quantities) from the ``electromagnetic'' self-energy of each of the connected
components of the boundary in a well defined manner. Our approach to the
Casimir effect is not to impose sharp boundary conditions on the fluctuating
field, but rather take into consideration its interaction with the plasma of
``charge carriers'' in the boundary, with the plasma frequency playing the role
of a physical UV cutoff. This also allows us to analyze deviations from a
perfect conductor behavior.

theories in the continuum formalism, based on the domain wall configuration in
(1+d) dim space-time. It is inspired by the recent progress in the chiral
fermions on the lattice. The wall ""height"" is given by 1/M, where M is a
regularization mass parameter and appears as a 1+d dim Dirac fermion mass. The
present approach gives a thermodynamic view to the domain wall or the overlap
formalism in the lattice field theory. We will show qualitative correspondence
between the present continuum results and those of the lattice. The extra
dimension is regarded as the (inverse) temperature t. The domains are defined
by the directions of the ""system movement"", not by the sign of M as in the
original overlap formalism. Physically the parameter M controls both the
chirality selection and the dimensional reduction to d dimension. From the
point of regularization, the limit $Mt\ra 0$ regularize the infra-red behaviour
whereas the condition on the momentum ($k^\m$) integral, $|k^\m|\leq M$,
regularize the ultra-violet behaviour.
  To check the new regularization works correctly, we take the 4 dim QED and 2
dim chiral gauge theory as examples. Especially the consistent and covariant
anomalies are correctly obtained. The choice of solutions of the higher dim
Dirac equation characterize the two anomalies. The projective properties of the
positive and negative energy free solutions are exploited in calculation. Some
integral functions, the incomplete gamma functions and the generalized
hypergeometric functions characteristically appear in the regularization
procedure.

(m) -partite quantum systems, we study exactly and asymptotically (in n)
reversible transformations among n'th tensor powers of such states (ie n copies
of the state shared among the same m parties) under local quantum operations
and classical communication (LOCC). With regard to exact transformations, we
show that two states whose 1-party entropies agree are either locally-unitarily
(LU) equivalent or else LOCC-incomparable. In particular we show that two
tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are LOCC-incomparable to
three bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states symmetrically shared among
the three parties. Asymptotic transformations result in a simpler
classification than exact transformations. We show that m-partite pure states
having an m-way Schmidt decomposition are simply parameterizable, with the
partial entropy across any nontrivial partition representing the number of
standard ``Cat'' states (|0^m>+|1^m>) asymptotically interconvertible to the
state in question. For general m-partite states, partial entropies across
different partitions need not be equal, and since partial entropies are
conserved by asymptotically reversible LOCC operations, a multicomponent
entanglement measure is needed, with each scalar component representing a
different kind of entanglement, not asymptotically interconvertible to the
other kinds. In particular the m=4 Cat state is not isentropic to, and
therefore not asymptotically interconvertible to, any combination of bipartite
and tripartite states shared among the four parties. Thus, although the m=4 cat
state can be prepared from bipartite EPR states, the preparation process is
necessarily irreversible, and remains so even asymptotically.

perform, in repeating a fixed unitary transformation on the total system, an
arbitrary unitary transformation on an arbitrary data state, by including a
program as another part of the input state. We note that if such a UQTM really
exists, with the program state dependent on the data state, and if the
prescribed halting scheme is indeed valid, then there would be no entanglement
between the halt qubit and other qubits, as pointed out by Myers. If, however,
the program is required to be independent of the data, the concerned
entanglement appears, and is problematic no matter whether the halt qubit is
monitored or not. We also note that for a deterministic programmable quantum
gate array, as discussed by Nielson and Chuang, if the program is allowed to
depend on the data state, then its existence has not been ruled out. On the
other hand, if UQTM exists, it can be simulated by repeating the operation of a
fixed gate array. However, more importantly, we observe that it is actually
still open whether Deutsch's UQTM exists and whether a crucial concatenation
scheme, of which the halting scheme is a special case, is valid.

experiments that can be performed, and for each such experiment an ordinary
statistical model is defined. The parameters of the single experiments are
functions of a hyperparameter, which defines the state of the system. There is
a symmetry group acting on the hyperparameters, and for the induced action on
the parameters of the single experiment a simple consistency property is
assumed, called permissibility of the parametric function. The other
assumptions needed are rather weak. The derivation relies partly on quantum
logic, partly on a group representation of the hyperparameter group, where the
invariant spaces are shown to be in 1-1 correspondence with the equivalence
classes of permissible parametric functions. Planck's constant only plays a
role connected to generators of unitary group representations.

"quant-ph/9908076","Inge S. Helland","Inge S. Helland","Quantum Theory from Symmetries in a General Statistical Parameter Space","The paper has been withdrawn because it is outdated",,,,"quant-ph",,"  The aim of this paper is to show a connection between an extended theory of
statistical experiments on the one hand and the foundation of quantum theory on
the other hand. The main aspects of this extension are: One assumes a
hyperparameter space $\Phi$ common to several potential experiments, and a
basic symmetry group G associated with this space. The parameter \theta_{a} of
a single experiment, looked upon as a parametric function $\theta_{a}(\cdot)$
on $\Phi$, is said to be permissible if G induces in a natural way a new group
on the image space of the function. If this is not the case, it is arranged for
by changing from G to a subgroup $G_{a}$. The Haar measure of this subgroup
(confined to the spectrum; see below) is the prefered prior when the parameter
is unknown. It is assumed that the hyperparameter itself can never be
estimated, only a set of parametric functions. Model reduction is made by
restricting the space of complex `wave' functions, also regarded as functions
on $\Phi$, to an irreducible invariant subspace $\mathcal{M}$ under G. The
spectrum of a parametric function is defined from natural group-theoretical and
statistical considerations. We establish that a unique operator can be
associated with every parametric functions $\theta_{a}(\cdot)$, and essentially
all of the ordinary quantum theory formalism can be retrieved from these and a
few related assumptions. In particular the concept of spectrum is consistent.
The scope of the theory is illustrated on the one hand by the example of a spin
1/2 particle and a related EPR discussion, on the other hand by a simple
macroscopic example.
