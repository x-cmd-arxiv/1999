star binaries (BH/NS) are compared with mergers of binary neutron stars
(NS/NS). The simulations are Newtonian, but take into account the emission and
backreaction of gravitational waves. The use of a physical nuclear equation of
state allows us to include the effects of neutrino emission. For low neutron
star to black hole mass ratios the neutron star transfers mass to the black
hole during a few cycles of orbital decay and subsequent widening before
finally being disrupted, whereas for ratios near unity the neutron star is
already distroyed during its first approach. A gas mass between about 0.3 and
about 0.7 solar masses is left in an accretion torus around the black hole and
radiates neutrinos at a luminosity of several 10^{53} erg/s during an estimated
accretion time scale of about 0.1 s. The emitted neutrinos and antineutrinos
annihilate into electron-positron pairs with efficiencies of 1-3% percent and
rates of up to 2*10^{52} erg/s, thus depositing an energy of up to 10^{51} erg
above the poles of the black hole in a region which contains less than 10^{-5}
solar masses of baryonic matter. This could allow for relativistic expansion
with Lorentz factors around 100 and is sufficient to explain apparent burst
luminosities of up to several 10^{53} erg/s for burst durations of
approximately 0.1-1 s, if the gamma emission is collimated in two moderately
focussed jets in a fraction of about 1/100-1/10 of the sky.

the M31 galaxy. The average (median) V-band flux contribution from luminous
companions which are not resolved on the ground-based images is about 19% (12%)
of the flux of the Cepheid. This is a large effect - at the 10% level for
distances. The current Cepheid distance estimates to M31 are all ground-based,
and are thus affected (underestimated). We discuss indirect methods to find
which Cepheids are blended, e.g. by the use of well-sampled light curves in at
least two optical bands. More generally, our ground-based resolution in M31
corresponds to the HST resolution at about 10 Mpc. Blending leads to
systematically low distances in the observed galaxies, and therefore to
systematically high estimates of H_0; we discuss the issue and the

is allowed only after redshift z=1 so that enough hot gas is available to form
large, rapidly rotating stellar discs if angular momentum is approximately
conserved during collapse. The specific angular momenta of the final galaxies
are found to be sensitive to the assumed background cosmology. This dependence
arises from the different angular momenta contained in the haloes at the epoch
when the gas begins to collapse and the inhomogeneity of the subsequent halo
evolution. In the Lambda-dominated cosmology, the ratio of stellar specific
angular momentum to that of the dark matter halo (measured at the virial
radius) has a median value of ~0.24 at z=0. The corresponding quantity for the
Lambda=0 cosmology is over 3 times lower. It is concluded that the observed

on relativistic Ohm's law in stationary axisymmetric geometry. By neglecting
the poloidal flows of plasma in simplified magnetospheric models, we discuss
self-excited dynamos due to the frame-dragging effect (originally pointed out
by Khanna & Camenzind), and we propose alternative processes to generate
axisymmetric magnetic fields against ohmic dissipation. The first process
(which may be called induced excitation) is caused by the help of a background
uniform magnetic field in addition to the dragging of inertial frames. It is
shown that excited multipolar components of poloidal and azimuthal fields are
sustained as stationary modes, and outgoing Poynting flux converges toward the
rotation axis. The second one is self-excited dynamo through azimuthal
convection current, which is found to be effective if plasma rotation becomes
highly relativistic with a sharp gradient in the angular velocity. In this case
no frame-dragging effect is needed, and the coupling between charge separation
and plasma rotation becomes important. We discuss briefly the results in
relation to active phenomena in the relativistic magnetospheres.

ULIRGs is similar to the one found for template starbursts.The shapes of the
PAH features are sometimes unusual.Extinction has a noticeable effect on the
PAH spectra of ULIRG starbursts. We have obtained high resolution near-infrared
imaging for the Southern ISOPHOT-S ULIRGs to investigate their evolution stage.
The majority (68%) of the ULIRGs imaged are double systems and all show
distorted morphologies. Using separations for our work and from the literature,
we have examined whether ULIRGs that are advanced mergers are more AGN-like. We
have found no such evidence contrary to what is postulated by the classical
evolutionary scenario. No correlation is found between the stage of merger in
ULIRGs and their infrared luminosity.We also find that the total mass of
interstellar gas, as estimated from the CO (1-0) luminosity, does not decrease
with decreasing merger separation. When both an AGN and a starburst occur
concurrently in ULIRGs, we find that the starburst dominates the luminosity
output. We propose that the available gas reservoir and the individual

optically visible T Tauri stars (DG Tauri, HL Tauri, GG Tauri,and GM Aurigae)

the objects into three categories: separate envelope (separation > 6500 AU),
common envelope (separation 150-3000 AU), and common disk (separation < 100
AU). These three groups can be linked with fragmentation events during the star
formation process: separate envelopes from prompt initial fragmentation and the
separate collapse of a loosely condensed cloud, common envelopes from
fragmentation of a moderately centrally condensed spherical system, and common
disk from fragmentation of a high angular momentum circumstellar disk.

a quantum wire coupled to reservoirs, treating this structure as a unified
quantum system and taking into account the Coulomb interaction of electrons.
The chemical potential difference that exists between a decoupled, isolated
quantum wire and the reservoirs gives rise to charge transfer in the coupled
system. We show that the quantum wire can be charged positively or negatively
or remain neutral as a whole, depending on such factors as the wire radius and
the background charge density in the wire. The magnitude of the charge and its
sign are to a large extent determined by the exchange interaction of the
electrons in the wire. Using a Hartree-Fock approach, we develop a model of a
quantum wire which includes the reservoirs. This model allows us to find the
self-consistent distribution of the electron density and the potential in the
wire both at equilibrium and in the presence of transport. The linear
conductance is investigated as a function of the chemical potential. The
nonadiabatic transition from the reservoirs to the wire leads to conductance
oscillations caused by multiple scattering of electron waves. The period of the
oscillations depends on the charge acquired by the wire and the exchange
energy. We find that the exchange interaction strongly enhances the Friedel
oscillations near the contacts. However, they do not noticeably suppress the
conductance because the wire has a finite length and is charged. Under far from
equilibrium conditions, which appear when the applied voltage exceeds the Fermi
energy in the wire, the system becomes unstable with respect to fluctuations of
the electric potential and the electron density. The instability results in the
appearance of multistable electron states.

manifold, a sort of ``local Wick rotation'' of the metric can be performed
provided the metric is a locally analytic function of the coordinates and the
coordinates are ``physical''. No time-like Killing field is necessary. Such a
local Wick rotation analytically continues the Lorentzian metric in a
neighborhood of any point, or, more generally, in a neighborhood of a
space-like (Cauchy) hypersurface, into a Riemannian metric. The continuation
locally preserves geodesically convex neighborhoods. In order to make rigorous
the procedure, the concept of a complex pseudo-Riemannian (not Hermitian or
K\""ahlerian) manifold is introduced and some features are analyzed. Using these
tools, the symmetry of Hadamard/Seeley-deWitt off-diagonal coefficients is
proven in Lorentzian analytical manifolds by analytical continuation of the
(symmetric) Riemannian heat-kernel coefficients. This continuation is performed
in geodesically convex neighborhoods in common with both the metrics. Then, the
symmetry is generalized to $C^\infty$ non analytic Lorentzian manifolds by
approximating Lorentzian $C^{\infty}$ metrics by analytic metrics in common
geodesically convex neighborhoods. The symmetry requirement plays a central
r\^{o}le in the point-splitting renormalization procedure of the one-loop
stress-energy tensor in curved spacetimes for Hadamard quantum states.

elementary systems. Already the quantization of a particle on a circle shows
that the standard procedure has to be supplemented by an additional condition
on the admissibility of group actions. A systematic strategy for finding
admissible group actions for particular subbundles of cotangent spaces is
developed, two-dimensional prototypes of which are T^*R^+ and S^1 x R^+
(interpreted as restrictions of T^*R and T^*S^1 to positive coordinate and
momentum, respectively). In this framework (and under an additional, natural
condition) an SO_+(1,2)-action on S^1 x R^+ results as the unique admissible
group action.
  For symplectic manifolds which are (specific) parts of phase spaces with
known quantum theory a simple projection method of quantization is formulated.
For T^*R^+ and S^1 x R^+ equivalent results to those of more established (but
more involved) quantization schemes are obtained. The approach may be of
interest, e.g., in attempts to quantize gravity theories where demanding
nondegenerate metrics of a fixed signature imposes similar constraints.
