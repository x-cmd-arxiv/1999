which acts everywhere within disks, regardless of whether or not they are
stably stratified, and can move entropy in either direction. We have generated
a series of vertical structure models and thermal equilibrium curves using the
scaling law for the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ suggested by the exponential
decay of the X-ray luminosity in SXTs. We have also included equilibrium curves
for DNe using an $\alpha$ which is constant down to a small magnetic Reynolds
number ($\sim 10^4$). Our models indicate that weak convection is usually
eliminated by turbulent radial mixing. The substitution of turbulent heat
transport for convection is more important on the unstable branches of thermal
equilibrium S-curves when $\alpha$ is larger. The low temperature turnover
points $\Sigma_{max}$ on the equilibrium S-curves are significantly reduced by
turbulent mixing in DNe and SXT disks. However, in AGN disks the standard
mixing-length theory for convection is still a useful approximation when we use
the scaling law for $\alpha$, since these disks are very thin at the relevant
radii. In accordance with previous work, we find that constant $\alpha$ models
give almost vertical S-curves in the $\Sigma-T$ plane and consequently imply
very slow, possibly oscillating, cooling waves.

the action in the space of the expansion coefficients of the orbits. The
TREECODE gravity solver routine is used for computing the gravitational fields

particular observation when the oscillation is the strongest. The measured hard

phase lag increases from insignificant detection at 5.2-7.0 keV to as much as
2.3 radians (which corresponds a time lag of $\sim$5.6 ms) above $\sim$13 keV.
Also detected in the same observation are one narrowly peaked, strong QPO at 67
mHz, along with its first three harmonics, one weak QPO at $\sim$400 mHz and
one broad QPO at $\sim$840 mHz. Similar cross spectral analyses have been
performed on these QPOs (and the harmonics), in order to measure any phase lags
associated with the features. Phase lags are detected in all, with similar
energy dependence. For the 67 mHz QPO, the results are quite intriguing: only
the first and third harmonic components show hard lags, while the fundamental
and the second harmonic components actually display smaller {\it soft} lags.
Coupled with the energy dependence of the QPO amplitude, the results seem to
indicate a complicated change in the signal profile with photon energy. I will
discuss the implication of the phase lags on possible origins of the QPOs.

spin-ordering. It is characterized by on-site repulsive electron-electron
interactions, causing antiferromagnetism, and nearest-neighbor attractive
interactions, giving rise to d-wave superconductivity. Due to a special choice
for the lattice, this model has a strong-coupling limit where the
superconductivity can be described by a bosonic theory, similar to the strongly
coupled negative U Hubbard model. This limit is analyzed in the present paper.
A rich mean-field phase diagram is found and the leading quantum corrections to
the mean-field results are calculated. The first-order line between the
antiferromagnetic- and the superconducting phase is found to terminate at a
tricritical point, where two second-order lines originate. At these lines, the
system undergoes a transition to- and from a phase exhibiting both
antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity. At finite temperatures above the
spin-disordering line, quantum-critical behavior is found. For specific values
of the model parameters, it is possible to obtain SO(5) symmetry involving the
spin- and the phase-sector at the tricritical point. Although this symmetry is
explicitly broken by the projection to the lower Hubbard band, it survives on
the mean-field level, and modes related to a spontaneously broken SO(5)
symmetry are present on the level of the random phase approximation in the
superconducting phase.

$\ell_0$ between the neighboring bilayers. Thus, the T-dependence of

theory. The notion of Kaluza-Klein compactification is then introduced, and is
used to relate the eleven dimensional discussion to supergravity in 9+1

them. Branes in both 10+1 and 9+1 dimensions are included. Finally, although

holographic principle. We argue that it can be derived from the dynamical
holographic principle which states that the dynamics of a system in a region
should be described by a system which lives on the boundary of the region. This
last principle can be valid in general relativity because the ADM hamiltonian
reduces to the surface term.

with the CP violating ratio $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ in a general class of

substantially larger than in the Standard Model. We point out that radiative
effects relate the double left-right mass insertion to the single left-left

stringent bound on the supersymmetric contribution to the $Z$ penguin. Using
this bound, and those coming from recent data on $\epsilon'/\epsilon$ we find
${\rm BR}(K_L \to \pi^0 \nu \bar \nu)\lsim 1.2\cdot 10^{-10}$, ${\rm BR}(K^+

CKM parameters and neglecting the possibility of cancellations among different

principle, but rather unlikely. We stress the importance of a measurement of
these three branching ratios, together with improved data and improved theory
of $\epsilon'/\epsilon$, in order to shed light on the realization of various
supersymmetric scenarios. We reemphasize that the most natural enhancement of

and its compactification. Generalized spin curves, or r-spin curves are a
natural generalization of 2-spin curves (algebraic curves with a
theta-characteristic), and have been of interest lately because they are the
subject of a remarkable conjecture of E. Witten, and because of the
similarities between the intersection theory of these moduli spaces and that of
the moduli of stable maps.
  We generalize results of Cornalba, giving relations between many of the
elements of the Picard group of the stacks. These relations are important in
the proof of the genus-zero case of Witten's conjecture given in
math.AG/9905034. We use these relations to show that when 2 or 3 divides r,
then the Picard group of the open stack has non-zero torsion. And finally, we
work out some specific examples for small values of g and r.

describing the NN and N Delta systems. The effect of final state interaction is
important in the low energy part of the spectra. In the delta region, the
cross-section is very sensitive to the effects of Delta-N interaction and Delta
N - NN process. The latter has also a large influence well below the pion
threshold. The calculation underestimates the experimental cross-section
between the quasi-elastic and the delta peaks; this is possibly due to
projectile excitation or purely mesonic exchange currents.

investigated through the renormalization condition used to fit the free

data well at momenta much less than 50 MeV, a variation in the renormalization
condition results in 100% expected uncertainties at momenta as low as 100 MeV.
This uncertainty can be traced to the presence of large cancelations between
terms entering at NNLO, which are found to be several times larger than the
terms entering at NLO. This implies a fundamental lack of predictive power at
this order int he Q expansion of \epsilon_1. Given the small empirical size,
this lack of predictive power is easily understood in terms of simple power
counting arguments.

significant suppression of both at large $x_F$. The small $x_F$ regions is
dominated by fully formed charmonium states and thus enables us to discuss the
formation time and the cross section of the different charmonium states. In the
large $x_F$ region the interaction of the charmonium states with nuclear matter
has to be described by partonic degrees of freedom, because in that kinematic
domain the formation time is much larger than the nuclear radii. The
understanding of this region will be crucial for the interpretation of the data
