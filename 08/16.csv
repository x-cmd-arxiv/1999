simulation of an LCDM cosmology. Our statistical sample contains ~5000 haloes
in the range 10^{11}-10^{14} M_sun. The profiles are parameterized by an NFW
form with two parameters, an inner radius r_s and a virial radius r_v, and we
define the halo concentration c_v = r_v/r_s. First, we find that, for a given
halo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is c_v ~
1/(1+z), corresponding to a roughly constant r_s with redshift. We present an
improved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relations
between halo parameters and their redshift dependence. The implications are
that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer than
expected before. Second, we find that the scatter in log(c_v) is ~0.18,
corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of dV/V ~ 0.12. We
discuss implications for modelling the Tully-Fisher relation, which has a
smaller reported intrinsic scatter. Third, haloes in dense environments tend to
be more concentrated than isolated haloes. These results suggest that c_v is an
essential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss
implications for the universality of the Tully-Fisher relation, the formation
of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the Hubble sequence.

fragment into a lot of hadrons and scatter off the thermal plasma which is
constituted by photons, electrons and nucleons. For the relatively low mass
holes we point out that the dominant effect is the inter-conversion between
ambient proton and neutron through the strong interaction induced by the
emitted hadrons. Even after the freeze-out time of the week interactions
between neutron and proton, more neutrons are produced and the synthesized
light element abundances could be drastically changed. Comparing the
theoretical predictions with the observational data, we constrain the PBH's
density and their lifetime. We obtain the upper bound for PBH's initial mass

I consider the effect of this dissociating flux on the oxygen chemistry in
C-type shocks.
  Typically a few percent of the water molecules produced within the shock
front are dissociated before the gas has cooled to 50K. The resulting column
density of warm OH rises from 10^15 to 10^16 cm^-2 as the ionisation rate is
increased from 10^-17 (typical of dark clouds) to 10^-15 s^-1 (adjacent to
supernova remnants). These column densities produce substantial emission in the
far-infrared rotational transitions of OH, and are consistent with the OH/H2O
ratios inferred from ISO observations of emission from molecular shocks. For
high ionisation rates the column of warm OH is sufficient to explain the
OH(1720 MHz) masers that occur where molecular clouds are being shocked by
supernova remnants.
  The predicted abundance of OH throughout the shock front will enable C-type
shocks to be examined with high spectral resolution through radio observations
of the four hyperfine ground state transitions of OH at 18cm and heterodyne

study the soft optical phonons in La2-xSrxCuO4 at x=0.10, 0.12 and 0.18. We
found at x=0.18 that the softening of Z-point phonon, suggesting incipient
structural transition from the low-temperature orthorhombic (LTO) to
low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase, breaks at Tc, which is consistent with
the previous report by Lee et al. for the optimally doped x=0.15 sample. As for
x=0.10 and 0.12, on the other hand, the softening continues even below Tc. It
is thus clarified that the breaking of soft phonon is characteristic of
La2-xSrxCuO4 in the optimally and overdoped regions. In the course of studying
the soft phonons, we discovered that a central peak remains above the LTO to
high-temperature tetragonal (HTT) phase transition at Ts1 and splits into
incommensurate components along the (1 1 0)HTT direction at higher
temperatures. This is a common feature for both x=0.12 and 0.18 and their
temperature dependences of the splitting 2d can be scaled by using a
renormalized temperature T/Ts1. In the high temperature limit, d saturates
around d ~ 0.12 r.l.u., which value is close to the splitting of incommensurate
magnetic signals. This implies that the incipient lattice modulation starts
appearing at very high temperature. Details of this modulation and its
relations with other properties are, however, not yet clarified.

then one can obtain a Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole. If the asymptotically
AdS space rotates then one can obtain a Kerr-AdS hole. One might expect
superradiant scattering to be possible in either of these cases. Superradiant
modes reflected off the potential barrier outside the hole would be
re-amplified at the horizon, and a classical instability would result. We point
out that the existence of a Killing vector field timelike everywhere outside
the horizon prevents this from occurring for black holes with negative action.
Such black holes are also thermodynamically stable in the grand canonical
ensemble. The CFT duals of these black holes correspond to a theory in an
Einstein universe with a chemical potential and a theory in a rotating Einstein
universe. We study these CFTs in the zero coupling limit. In the first case,
Bose-Einstein condensation occurs on the boundary at a critical value of the
chemical potential. However the supergravity calculation demonstrates that this
is not to be expected at strong coupling. In the second case, we investigate
the limit in which the angular velocity of the Einstein universe approaches the
speed of light at finite temperature. This is a new limit in which to compare
the CFT at strong and weak coupling. We find that the free CFT partition
function and supergravity action have the same type of divergence but the usual
factor of 4/3 is modified at finite temperature.

model. Convergence in the elastic scattering, excitation, ionization, and
positronium formation channels is studied as a function of the number and type
of states used to expand the total wave function. It is found that all
unphysical resonances disappear only if near-complete pseudostate expansions
are applied to both the atomic and positronium centers.

minimum number of (pure) product states needed in convex combination to
construct A. We study the set of all separable states with optimal (pure state)
ensemble length equal to k or fewer. Lower bounds on k are found below which
these sets have measure 0 in the set of separable states. In the bipartite case
and the multiparticle case where one of the particles has significantly more
quantum numbers than the rest, the lower bound for non-pure state ensembles is
sharp. A consequence of our results is that for all two particle systems,
except possibly those with a qubit or those with a nine dimensional Hilbert
space, and for all systems with more than two particles the optimal pure state
ensemble length for a randomly picked separable state is with probability 1
greater than the state's rank. In bipartite systems with probability 1 it is
greater than 1/4 the rank raised to the 3/2 power and in a system with p qubits
with probability 1 it is greater than (2^2p)/(1+2p), which is almost the square
of the rank.

demonstrates coherent control with a sequence of quantum operations that first
generates and then decodes the cat state (|000...>+|111...>)/sqrt(2) to the
standard initial state |000...>. This is the first high fidelity experimental
quantum algorithm on the currently largest physical quantum register, which has
seven quantum bits (qubits) provided by the nuclei of crotonic acid. The
experiment has the additional benefit of verifying a seven coherence in a
generic system of coupled spins. Our implementation combines numerous nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques in one experiment and introduces practical
methods for translating quantum networks to control operations. The
experimental procedure can be used as a reliable and efficient method for
creating a standard pseudo-pure state, the first step for implementing
traditional quantum algorithms in liquid state NMR. The benchmark and the
techniques can be adapted for use on other proposed quantum devices.

A 61 (2000) 032312","10.1103/PhysRevA.61.032312",,"quant-ph",,"  We present a general method which expresses a unitary operator by the product
of operators allowed by the Hamiltonian of spin-1/2 systems. In this method,
the generator of an operator is found first, and then the generator is expanded
by the base operators of the product operator formalism. Finally, the base
operators disallowed by the Hamiltonian, including more than two-body
interaction operators, are replaced by allowed ones by the axes transformation
and coupling order reduction technique. This method directly provides pulse
sequences for the nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer, and can be
generally applied to other systems.

describing the time-development of the detector and the measured system at
once. Using these equations we find that the continuous measurement of the
unstable system does not affect its exponential decay, $\exp (-\Gamma t)$,
contrary to expectations based on the Quantum Zeno effect . However, the width
of the energy distribution of the tunneling electron is no more $\Gamma$, but
increases due to the decoherence, generated by the detector.
