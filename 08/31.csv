  the January 10, 2000 issue, of the Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1086/308194",,"astro-ph",,"  There has recently been interest in the role of inverse bremsstrahlung, the
emission of photons by fast suprathermal ions in collisions with ambient
electrons possessing relatively low velocities, in tenuous plasmas in various
astrophysical contexts. This follows a long hiatus in the application of
suprathermal ion bremsstrahlung to astrophysical models since the early 1970s.
The potential importance of inverse bremsstrahlung relative to normal
bremsstrahlung, i.e. where ions are at rest, hinges upon the underlying
velocity distributions of the interacting species. In this paper, we identify
the conditions under which the inverse bremsstrahlung emissivity is significant
relative to that for normal bremsstrahlung in shocked astrophysical plasmas. We
determine that, since both observational and theoretical evidence favors
electron temperatures almost comparable to, and certainly not very deficient
relative to proton temperatures in shocked plasmas, these environments
generally render inverse bremsstrahlung at best a minor contributor to the
overall emission. Hence inverse bremsstrahlung can be safely neglected in most
models invoking shock acceleration in discrete sources such as supernova
remnants. However, on scales > 100pc distant from these sources, Coulomb
collisional losses can deplete the cosmic ray electrons, rendering inverse
bremsstrahlung, and perhaps bremsstrahlung from knock-on electrons, possibly
detectable.

incompleteness, scale height-age correlations, and stellar evolutionary
effects. The results show that the Milky Way has undergone fluctuations in the
global star formation rate with amplitudes greater than a factor of 2-3 on
timescales less than 0.2-1 Gyr. The actual history is likely to be more bursty
than found here because of the smearing effect of age uncertainties. There is
some evidence for a slow secular increase in the star formation rate, perhaps a
record of the accumulation history of our galaxy. A smooth nearly-constant star
formation rate history is strongly ruled out, confirming the result first
discovered by Barry (1988) using a smaller sample and a different age

extended towards the milliarcsecond scale if it is to resolve the distant

SKA's angular resolution towards the milliarcsecond scale. Two possible
SKA-VLBI configurations have been investigated and simulated SKA and SKA-VLBI
visibility data sets generated. The effects of non-uniform data weighting on
the associated images are considered. The results suggest that the preferred
option is for SKA to be extended to trans-continental dimensions. By retaining
50% of the array's collecting area within a region no larger than 50 km, the
surface brightness sensitivity of the array at arcsec resolution is hardly
compromised. In this configuration SKA's capabilities are impressive: in a
single 12 hour run, between 100-1000 sources will be simultaneously detected
and imaged with arcsecond, sub-arcsecond and milliarcsecond resolution.

be the companion. If it is a main-sequence star in the cluster, it has radius
$\rcomp\simeq0.3 \rsun$, temperature $\teff\simeq3600 $K, and mass
$\mcomp\simeq0.3 \msun$. In many formation models, however, the pulsar (spun up
by accretion or newly formed) and its companion are initially in an eccentric

bloated. Using constraints on the radius and temperature from the Roche and

a differential flow equation which is local in the flow parameter. We apply
this approach to the repulsive two-dimensional Hubbard model with nearest and

turns out to be of the same order of magnitude as the leading correction for
all chain lengths available in present days simulations. Borel resummation of

accounted for in the combined residuals. Thus an extensive analysis of the
perturbations induced on these orbital elements by the solid and ocean Earth
tides is carried out. It involves the l=2 terms for the solid tides and the
l=2,3,4 terms for the ocean tides. The perigee of LAGEOS II turns out to be
very sensitive to the l=3 part of the ocean tidal spectrum, contrary to the
nodes of LAGEOS and LAGEOS II. The uncertainty in the solid tidal
perturbations, mainly due to the Love number k2, ranges from 0.4% to 1.5%,
while the ocean tides are uncertain at 5%-15% level. The obtained results are
used in order to check in a preliminary way which tidal constituents the
Lense-Thirring shift is sensitive to. In particular it is tested if the
semisecular 18.6-year zonal tide really does not affect the combined residuals.
It turns out that, if modeled at the level of accuracy worked out in the paper,
the l=2,4 m=0 and also, to a lesser extent, the l=3 m=0 tidal perturbations

(E~80 GeV) via the identification of upward throughgoing muons. Lower energy
neutrinos (E~ 4 GeV) via the upgoing stopping and partially contained downgoing
muons (ID+UGS), or via the partially contained upgoing muons (IU). The measured
flux is reduced with respect to the predictions. For the high energy sample,
globally the flux reduction is $0.74\pm 0.054_{stat+sys} \pm 0.12_{th}$ and
varies with the zenith angle. The ratio of measured to expected events is
almost constant with the zenith angle for the low energy events, and is $0.57
\pm 0.08_{stat+sys} \pm 0.14_{theor}$ for the IU sample, and $0.71 \pm
0.09_{stat+sys} \pm 0.17_{theor}$ for the (ID+UGS). All the data sets are
consistent within a scenario of neutrino oscillations, with maximum mixing and
$\Delta m^2 \sim 10^{-3}\div 10^{-2} eV^2$.

signature (10,2). The most natural algebraic starting point is the F-algebra,
which is the de Sitter-type (10,2) extension of the super-Poincare algebra. We
derive the corresponding geometric group curvatures and evaluate the
transformations of the associated gauge fields under the action of an
infinitesimal group element. We then discuss the formation of locally
supersymmetric actions using these quantities. Due to the absence of any
vielbein terms there is no obvious way to define spacetime as such. In
addition, there is also no way in which we may naturally construct an action
which is linear in the twelve dimensional curvatures. We consider the
implications of the simplest possible quadratic theories. We then investigate
the relationship between the twelve dimensional theories and Lorentz signature
theories in lower dimensions. We argue that in this context the process of
dimensional reduction must be replaced by that of group theoretic contraction.
Upon contraction a regular spacetime emerges and we find that the twelve
dimensional curvature constraint reduces to an Einstein-type equation in which
a quadratic non-linearity in the Ricci scalar is suppressed by a factor of the
same magnitude as the cosmological constant. Finally, we discuss the degrees of
freedom of multi-temporal variables and their relation to ultra-hyperbolic wave
equations.

conjugate momenta. Then all fields are expanded in a Taylor series around the
observer's present position, and terms of order higher than p are truncated.

  If U^*JU = UJU^* = J then U is said to be J-unitary.
  KREIN Problem: given a J-unitary operator U, does there exist an U-invariant
subspace L, say, with r(U|L)\leq1 ?
  In the special case that the operator U^*U-I is compact this problem was
solved in the positive by M.G.Krein in 1964. We shall show that, by contrast,
in the general case such a subspace L needs not exist. Moreover, there asserts
Theorem: For every real c>0 there exists some J-unitary operator U such that
(i) if L is some nonzero U-invariant subspace, then r(U|L)>c; (ii) if L' is
some nonzero U^{-1}-invariant subspace, then r(U^{-1}|L')>c;

similar result is obtained for the case of continuous 'dynamic' and for the

for negative energies so that charge conjugation invariance is preserved. The
result, which emerges naturally from the application of spectator principles to
systems of particles with negative energies, is to replace all factors of the
external energies $W_i$ by $\sqrt{W^2_i}$, insuring that the amplitudes are
independent of the sign of the energies $W_i$.

of self-similarly contracting or expanding solutions: during the motion, vortex
triangle remains similar to the original one, while its area decreases (grows)
at a constant rate. A contracting configuration brings three vortices to a
single point in a finite time; this phenomenon known as vortex collapse is of
principal importance for many-vortex systems. Dynamics of close-to-collapse
vortex configurations depends on the way the collapse conditions are violated.
Using an effective potential representation, a detailed quantitative analysis
of all the different types of near-collapse dynamics is performed when two of
the vortices are identical. We discuss time and length scales, emerging in the
problem, and their behavior as the initial vortex triangle is approaching to an
exact collapse configuration. Different types of critical behaviors, such as
logarithmic or power-law divergences are exhibited, which emphasizes the
importance of the way the collapse is approached. Period asymptotics for all
singular cases are presented as functions of the initial vortices
configurations. Special features of passive particle mixing by a near-collapse
flows are illustrated numerically.

pulses and (ii) geometric alignment due to an angle-dependent ionization rate

between dynamic and geometric alignment.

fixed state to the set of classical states, in the same extent as the Hillery
measure. This measure increases when on the fixed state acts a Gaussian noise
map i.e. the selected state becomes closer to the classical states.
