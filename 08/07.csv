probably not confined by thermal pressure, but rather their morphology may be
determined by the large-scale velocity field. Also, they may have shorter
lifetimes than normally believed, as the large-scale turbulent modes have
larger associated velocities than the clouds' internal velocity dispersions.
Structural characterization algorithms have started to distinguish the best
fitting simulations to a particular observation, and have opened several new
questions, such as the nature of the observed line width-size relation and of
the relation between the structures seen in channel maps and the true spatial
distribution of the density and velocity fields. The velocity field apparently
dominates the morphology seen in intensity channel maps, at least in cases when
the density field exhibits power spectra steep enough. Furthermore, the
selection of scattered fluid parcels along the line of sight (LOS) by their
LOS-velocity inherent to the construction of spectroscopic data may introduce
spurious small-scale structure in high spectral resolution channel maps.

resonance lines at 7700 \AA as the source of anomalous absorption seen in the

general. This conclusion is supported by the recent work of Tsuji {\it et al.}
1999, though unlike them we find that dust need not be invoked to explain the
spectra of methane dwarfs shortward of 1 micron. We find that a combination of
enhanced alkali abundances due to rainout and a more realistic non-Lorentzian
theory of resonant line shapes may be all that is needed to properly account
for these spectra from 0.5 to 1.0 microns. The WFPC2 $I$ measurement of Gliese
229B is also consistent with this theory. Furthermore, a combination of the
blue wings of this K I resonance doublet, the red wings of the Na D lines at
5890 \AA, and, perhaps, the Li I line at 6708 \AA can explain in a natural way
the observed WFPC2 $R$ band flux of Gliese 229B. Hence, we conclude that the
neutral alkali metals play a central role in the near-infrared and optical
spectra of methane dwarfs and that their lines have the potential to provide
crucial diagnostics of brown dwarfs. We speculate on the systematics of the
near-infrared and optical spectra of methane dwarfs, for a given mass and
composition, that stems from the progressive burial with decreasing \teff of
the alkali metal atoms to larger pressures and depths.

emission line at 1.643um, but a reobservation at higher spectral resolution
failed to confirm the line, leaving its reality in doubt. We consider various
hypotheses for the nature of this object. Its colors are unlike those of known
galactic stars, except perhaps the most extreme carbon stars or Mira variables
with thick circumstellar dust shells. It does not appear to be possible to
explain its spectral energy distribution as that of a normal galaxy at any
redshift without additional opacity from either dust or intergalactic neutral
hydrogen. The colors can be matched by those of a dusty galaxy at z >~ 2, by a
maximally old elliptical galaxy at z >~ 3 (perhaps with some additional
reddening), or by an object at z >~ 10 whose optical and 1.1um light have been
suppressed by the intergalactic medium. Under the latter hypothesis, if the

clouds are studied by means of one-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. The
radiative transfer of the ionizing photons due to the absorption by HI, HeI and
HeII, neglecting the emission, is explicitly taken into account. We find that
the complete suppression of collapse occurs for the clouds with circular
velocities typically in the range V_c \sim 15-40 km/s and the 50% reduction in
the cooled gas mass with V_c \sim 20-55 km/s. These values depend most
sensitively on the collapse epoch of the cloud, the shape of the UV spectrum,
and the evolution of the UV intensity. Compared to the optically thin case,
previously investigated by Thoul & Weinberg (1996), the absorption of the
external UV photon by the intervening medium systematically lowers the above
threshold values by \Delta V_c \sim 5 km/s. Whether the gas can contract or
keeps expanding is roughly determined by the balance between the gravitational
force and the thermal pressure gradient when it is maximally exposed to the
external UV flux. Based on our simulation results, we discuss a number of
implications on galaxy formation, cosmic star formation history, and the
observations of quasar absorption lines. In Appendix, we derive analytical
formulae for the photoionization coefficients and heating rates, which
incorporate the frequency/direction-dependent transfer of external photons.

energy transfer at the boundaries via a microscopic collision process. We apply
our method to the periodic Lorentz gas, where a point particle moves
diffusively through an ensemble of hard disks arranged on a triangular lattice.
First, collision rules are defined for this system in thermal equilibrium. They
determine the velocity of the moving particle such that the system is
deterministic, time reversible, and microcanonical. These collision rules can
systematically be adapted to the case where one associates arbitrarily many
degrees of freedom to the disk, which here acts as a boundary. Subsequently,
the system is investigated in nonequilibrium situations by applying an external
field. We show that in the limit where the disk is endowed by infinitely many
degrees of freedom it acts as a thermal reservoir yielding a well-defined
nonequilibrium steady state. The characteristic properties of this state, as
obtained from computer simulations, are finally compared to the ones of the
so-called Gaussian thermostated driven Lorentz gas.

essential part of protein-folding puzzle. Here we describe a simple model for
the formation of the $\beta$-hairpin, motivated by the fact that folding of a

that the coupling of ``primary'' backbone stiffness and ``secondary'' contact
formation (similar to the coupling between the ``secondary'' and ``tertiary''
structure in globular proteins), caused for example by side-chain packing
regularities, is responsible for producing an all-or-none 2-state
