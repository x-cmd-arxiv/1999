  3 figures. (Abstract is abridged.)",,"10.1086/312278",,"astro-ph",,"  We reinvestigate the question of spatial variation of the local D/H
abundance, using both archival GHRS spectra, and new echelle spectra of
G191-B2B obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) aboard
HST. Our analysis uses stratified line-blanketed non-LTE model atmosphere
calculations to determine the shape of the intrinsic WD Lyman-alpha profile and
estimate the WD photospheric contamination of the interstellar lines. Although
three velocity components were reported previously towards G191-B2B, we detect
only two velocity components. The first component is at V(hel) ~ 8.6 km/s and
the second at V(hel) ~ 19.3 km/s, which we identify with the Local Interstellar
Cloud (LIC). From the STIS data we derive D/H = 1.60(+0.39,-0.27)X10^-5 for the
LIC component, and D/H > 1.26X10^-5 for the 8.6 km/s component (uncertainties
denote 2-sigma or 95% confidence limits). The STIS data provide no evidence for
local or component-to-component variation in the D/H ratio. Despite using two
velocity components for the profile fitting and using a more physically
realistic WD Lyman-alpha profile for G191-B2B, our re-analysis of the GHRS data
indicates a component-to-component variation as well as a variation of the D/H
ratio in the LISM, neither of which are supported by the newer STIS data. We
believe the most probable cause for this difference is the characterization of
the background due to scattered light in the GHRS and STIS spectrographs. The
two-dimensional MAMA detectors of STIS measure both the spatial and wavelength
dependences of scattered light, allowing more accurate scattered light
corrections than was possible with GHRS.

to the distribution of local SNe. The distribution of high-z SNe Ia is found to
be similar to the local sample of SNe Ia discovered with CCDs, but different
than the sample discovered photographically. This is shown to be due to the
Shaw effect. These results have implications for the use of SNe Ia to determine
cosmological parameters if the local sample of supernovae used to calibrate the
light curve decline relationships is drawn from a sample discovered
photographically. A K-S test shows that the probability that the high redshift
SNe of the Supernova Cosmology Project are drawn from the same distribution as
the low redshift calibrators of Riess et al. is 0.1%. This is a potential
problem because photographically discovered SNe are preferentially discovered
farther away from the galaxy nucleus, where SNe show a lower scatter in
absolute magnitude, and are on average 0.3 magnitudes fainter than SNe located
closer to the center of their host galaxy. This raises questions about whether
or not the calibration SNe sample the full range of parameters potentially
present in high redshift SNe Ia. The limited data available suggest that the
calibration process is adequate; however, it would be preferable if high
redshift SNe and the low redshift SNe used to calibrate them were drawn from
the same sample, as subtle differences may be important. Data are also
presented which suggest that the seeming anti-Malmquist trend noticed by
Tammann et al.(1996, 1998) for SNe Ia in galaxies with Cepheid distances may be
due to the location of the SNe in their host galaxies.

neutron stars are investigated. Protoneutron stars are hot, lepton rich neutron
stars which are formed in Type-II supernovae. The hot dense matter is described
by a realistic equation of state which is obtained by extending a recent
approach of Myers and Swiatecki to the nuclear mass formula. We investigate the
properties of protoneutron stars and neutron stars at different evolutionary
stages in order to emphasize the differences between very young and old neutron
stars. The numerical calculations are performed by means of an exact
description of rapid, uniform rotation in the framework of general relativity.
We show that the minimal marginally stable protoneutron star mass is much
higher than the corresponding minimum mass of a cold neutron star. The minimum
gravitational (baryonic) mass of 0.89 - 1.13 M_{\sun} (0.95 - 1.29 M_{\sun}) of
a neutron star is therefore determined at the earliest stages of its evolution.
We also show that the use of different temperature profiles in the envelope as
well as different shapes of the neutrino sphere change the properties of
protoneutron stars and hot neutron stars by up to 20 %. A preliminary analysis
indicates that even the most massive protoneutron stars rotating with Kepler
frequency are secularly stable. Under the assumption of conserved angular
momentum and baryonic mass, the maximum rotational frequency of an evolved
neutron star is determined by the Kepler frequency of the protoneutron star. We
can thus derive a lower limit, P_min ~ 1.56 - 2.22 ms, to the rotational period
of young neutron stars with a canonical gravitational mass of 1.35 M_{\sun}.
This result furtherly supports the assumption that millisecond pulsars are
accelerated due to accretion onto a cold neutron star.

  Brunner, (San Francisco: ASP Conference Series)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We review theoretical approaches to the study of galaxy formation, with
emphasis on the role of hydrodynamic simulations in modeling the high redshift
galaxy population. We present new predictions for the abundance of star-forming
galaxies in the Lambda + cold dark matter model (Omega_m=0.4, Omega_L=0.6),
combining results from several simulations to probe a wide range of redshift.
At a threshold density of one object per arcmin^2 per unit z, these simulations
predict galaxies with star formation rates of 2 msun/yr (z=10), 5 msun/yr
(z=8), 20 msun/yr (z=6), 70-100 msun/yr (z=4-2), and 30 msun/yr (z=0.5). For
galaxies selected at a fixed comoving space density n=0.003 h^3 Mpc^{-3], a (50
Mpc/h)^3 simulation predicts a galaxy correlation function (r/5 Mpc/h)^{-1.8}
in comoving coordinates, essentially independent of redshift from z=4 to z=0.5.
Different cosmological models predict global histories of star formation that
reflect their overall histories of mass clustering, but robust numerical
predictions of the comoving space density of star formation are difficult
because the simulations miss the contribution from galaxies below their
resolution limit. The LCDM model appears to predict a star formation history
with roughly the shape inferred from observations, but it produces too many
stars at low redshift, predicting Omega_* ~ 0.015 at z=0. We conclude with a
brief discussion of this discrepancy and three others that suggest gaps in our
current theory of galaxy formation: small disks, steep central halo profiles,
and an excess of low mass dark halos. While these problems could fade as the
simulations or observations improve, they could also guide us towards a new
understanding of galactic scale star formation, the spectrum of primordial
fluctuations, or the nature of dark matter.

we discuss a new approach to communication with chaotic signals, which
demonstrates good performance in the presence of channel distortions. This
communication scheme is based upon chaotic signals in the form of pulse trains
where intervals between the pulses are determined by chaotic dynamics of a
pulse generator. The pulse train with chaotic interpulse intervals is used as a
carrier. Binary information is modulated onto this carrier by the pulse
position modulation method, such that each pulse is either left unchanged or
delayed by a certain time, depending on whether ``0'' or ``1'' is transmitted.
By synchronizing the receiver to the chaotic pulse train we can anticipate the
timing of pulses corresponding to ``0'' and ``1'' and thus can decode the
transmitted information. Based on the results of theoretical and experimental
studies we shall discuss the basic design principles for the chaotic pulse
generator, its synchronization, and the performance of the chaotic pulse

d-wave-like modulation of the antiferromagnetic gap, suggest an intimate
interrelation between the antiferromagnetic insulator and the superconductor
with its d-wave gap. This poses a new challenge to microscopic descriptions,
which should account for this correlation between, at first sight, very
different states of matter. Here, we propose a microscopic mechanism which
provides a definite correlation between these two different gap structures: it
is shown that a projected SO(5) theory, which aims at unifying
antiferromagnetism and d-wave superconductivity via a common symmetry principle
while explicitly taking the Mott-Hubbard gap into account, correctly describes
the observed gap characteristics. Specifically, it accounts for both the
dispersion and the order of magnitude difference between the antiferromagnetic
gap modulation and the superconducting gap.

of four-dimensional string models are considered: (i) orbifold
compactifications of perturbative heterotic string theory, (ii) scenarios based
on Ho\v{r}ava-Witten theory, and (iii) Type I string models (Type IIB
orientifolds). Nonuniversal phases of the gaugino mass parameters greatly
facilitate the necessary cancellations among the various contributions to the
EDM's; in the overall modulus limit, the gaugino masses are universal at tree
level in both the perturbative heterotic models and the Ho\v{r}ava-Witten
scenarios, which severely restricts the allowed regions of parameter space.
Nonuniversal gaugino masses do arise at one-loop in the heterotic orbifold
models, providing for corners of parameter space with ${\cal O}(1)$ phases
consistent with the phenomenological bounds. However, there is a possibility of
nonuniversal gaugino masses at tree level in the Type I models, depending on
the details of the embedding of the SM into the D- brane sectors. We find that
in a minimal model with a particular embedding of the Standard Model gauge
group into two D- brane sectors, viable large phase solutions can be obtained
over a wide range of parameter space.

a set of criteria for a plausible top quark seesaw theory, we develop two
models, the first of which has a heavy weak singlet fermion with hypercharge
4/3 while the second has, in addition, a heavy weak singlet hypercharge -2/3
fermion. At low energies, these theories contain one or two Higgs doublets
respectively. We then derive the low energy effective Higgs potential in detail
for the two-doublet theory as well as study the likely experimental signatures
for both theories. A strong constraint on the one-doublet model is the measured
value of the rho parameter which permits the new heavy fermion to have a mass
of about 5-7 TeV, when the Higgs has a mass greater than 300 GeV. In the
two-doublet model, mixing of the new heavy Y=-2/3 fermion and the b quark
affects the prediction for R_b. In order to agree with the current limits on
R_b, the mass of this fermion should be at least 12 TeV. The mass of the heavy
Y=4/3 fermion in the two-doublet model is not as sharply constrained by

use an N = 1 spurion analysis to determine the effects of the most general soft

forces the theory into a free Coulomb phase.
