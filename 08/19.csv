positrons in the unshocked winds of rotationally-powered binary pulsars. This
process can scatter low energy target photons to produce gamma rays with
energies from MeV to TeV. The binary radio pulsars PSR B1259-63 and PSR
J0045-73 are both in close eccentric orbits around bright main sequence stars
which provide a huge density of low energy target photons. The inverse Compton
scattering process transfers momentum from the pulsar wind to the scattered
photons, and therefore provides a drag which tends to decelerate the pulsar
wind. We present detailed calculations of the dynamics of a pulsar wind which
is undergoing inverse Compton scattering, showing that the deceleration of the
wind of PSR B1259-63 due to `inverse Compton drag' is small, but that this
process may confine the wind of PSR J0045-73 before it attains pressure balance
with the outflow of its companion star. We calculate the spectra and light
curves of the resulting inverse Compton emission from PSR B1259-63 and show
that if the size of the pulsar wind nebula is comparable to the binary
separation, then the gamma-ray emission from the unshocked wind may be
detectable by atmospheric Cerenkov detectors or by the new generation of
satellite-borne gamma-ray detectors such as INTEGRAL and GLAST. This mechanism
may therefore provide a direct probe of the freely-expanding regions of pulsar
winds, previously thought to be invisible.

we adopt a chemical evolution model which assumes two main infall episodes for
the formation of the Galaxy and which proved to be successful in reproducing
the majority of the observational constraints, at least for the case of a
constant IMF. Different variable IMFs are tested with this model, all assuming
that massive stars are preferentially formed in ambients of low metallicity.
This implies that massive stars are formed preferentially at early times and at
large galactocentric distances. Our numerical results have shown that all the
variable IMFs proposed so far are unable to reproduce all the relevant
observational constraints in the Galaxy and that a constant IMF still
reproduces better the observations. In particular, variable IMFs of the kind
explored here are unable to reproduce the observed abundance gradients even
when allowing for changes in other chemical evolution model parameters as, for
instance, the star formation rate. As a consequence of this we conclude that
the G-dwarf metallicity distribution is best explained by infall with a large
timescale and a constant IMF, since it is possible to find variable IMFs of the
kind studied here, reproducing the G-dwarf metallicity but this worsen the
agreement with other observational constraints.

we present estimates of beta from galaxy distributions constructed by applying
a variety of biased galaxy formation models to cosmological N-body simulations.
We compare the values of beta estimated using two different techniques: the

qualitatively consistent with models of the broad-band (radio-to-X-ray)

with small linear sizes (<150 kpc) have lower ionisation states, higher

emission line ratios of small radio sources are in agreement with theoretical
shock ionisation predictions and their velocity profiles are distorted.
Together with the other emission line properties this indicates that shocks
associated with the radio source dominate the kinematics and ionisation of the
emission line gas during the period that the radio source is expanding through
the ISM. Gas clouds are accelerated by the shocks, giving rise to the irregular
velocity structures observed, whilst shock compression of the clouds and the
presence of the ionising photons associated with the shocks combine to lower
the ionisation state of the emission line gas. By contrast, in larger sources
the shock fronts have passed well beyond the emission line regions; their
emission line gas has much more settled kinematical properties, indicative of
rotation, and emission line ratios consistent with the dominant source of
ionising photons being the active galactic nucleus. (Abridged)

conclusions of Best, Longair & R\""{o}ttgering (1997, 1998) in that we also find
z=1 3CR galaxies to be massive, well-evolved ellipticals, whose infrared
emission is dominated by starlight. However, we in fact find that the
scalelength distribution of 3CR galaxies at z \simeq 1 is completely
indistinguishable from that derived for their low-redshift counterparts from
our own recently-completed HST study of AGN hosts at z \simeq 0.2. There is
thus no evidence that 3CR radio galaxies at z \simeq 1 are dynamically
different from 3CR galaxies at low redshift. Moreover, for a 10-object
sub-sample we have determined the galaxy parameters with sufficient accuracy to
demonstrate, for the first time, that the z \simeq 1 3CR galaxies follow a
Kormendy relation which is indistinguishable from that displayed by
low-redshift ellipticals if one allows for purely passive evolution. The
implied rather modest level of passive evolution since z \simeq 1 is consistent
with that predicted from spectrophotometric models provided one assumes a high
formation redshift (z \ge 4) within a low-density Universe. We conclude that
there is no convincing evidence for significant dynamical evolution among 3CR
galaxies in the redshift interval 0<z<1, and that simple passive evolution
remains an acceptable interpretation of the K-z relation for powerful radio
galaxies.

doped single crystals of Y-123 and Bi-2212. The comparison of AF insulating and
metallic samples suggests that at least the low-energy part of the spectra
originates predominantly from excitations of free carriers. We therefore
propose an analysis of the data in terms of a memory function approach.
Dynamical scattering rates and mass-enhancement factors for the carriers are
obtained. In B2g symmetry the Raman data compare well to the results obtained
from ordinary and optical transport. For underdoped materials the dc scattering
rates in B1g symmetry become temperature independent and considerably larger
than in B2g symmetry. This increasing anisotropy is accompanied by a loss of
spectral weight in B2g symmetry in the range between the superconducting
transition at Tc and a characteristic temperature T* of order room temperature
which compares well with the pseudogap temperature found in other experiments.
The energy range affected by the pseudogap is doping and temperature
independent. The integrated spectral loss is approximately 25% in underdoped
samples and becomes much weaker towards higher carrier concentration. In
underdoped samples, superconductivity related features in the spectra can be
observed only in B2g symmetry. The peak frequencies scale with Tc. We do not
find a direct relation between the pseudogap and the superconducting gap.

in a random medium which was previously investigated by Edwards and Muthukumar
(EM). As noticed by Cates and Ball (CB) there is a discrepancy between the
predictions of the replica calculation of EM and the expectation that in an
infinite medium the quenched and annealed results should coincide (for a chain
that is free to move) and a long polymer should always collapse. CB argued that
only in a finite volume one might see a ``localization transition'' (or
crossover) from a stretched to a collapsed chain in three spatial dimensions.
Here we carry out the replica calculation in the presence of an additional
confining harmonic potential that mimics the effect of a finite volume. Using a
variational scheme with five variational parameters we derive analytically for
d<4 the result R~(g |ln \mu|)^{-1/(4-d)} ~(g lnV)^{-1/(4-d)}, where R is the
radius of gyration, g is the strength of the disorder, \mu is the spring
constant associated with the confining potential and V is the associated
effective volume of the system. Thus the EM result is recovered with their
constant replaced by ln(V) as argued by CB. We see that in the strict infinite
volume limit the polymer always collapses, but for finite volume a transition
from a stretched to a collapsed form might be observed as a function of the
strength of the disorder. For d<2 and for large
V>V'~exp[g^(2/(2-d))L^((4-d)/(2-d))] the annealed results are recovered and
R~(Lg)^(1/(d-2)), where L is the length of the polymer. Hence the polymer also
collapses in the large L limit. The 1-step replica symmetry breaking solution
is crucial for obtaining the above results.

they are in sphaleron mediated equilibrium. In this paper we point out the
surprising fact that in the Standard Model, if the asymmetries in the electron

It is found to have the tendency to prevent hadronization and therefore
delaying the conversion of the partons into a hadron gas. Because of the
continual expansion, the resulting hadron gas number densities are lower when
screening is included. This should reduce the hadronic noise to genuine signals
of the quark-gluon plasma. In this sense, color screening is favorable and
should be included in numerical models. In any case, we advocate that numerical
models should allow the confining forces and color screening to act on each
other so as to undergo the phase transition in a natural way. Hadronization is
also shown to seriously disrupt parton equilibration and is yet another reason
why full parton chemical equilibration should not be expected.

by supergravity, both bosons and fermions are created. In the bosonic sector,
the leading channel of particle production is the non-perturbative regime of
parametric resonance dominated by those bosons which are created exponentially
fast with the largest characteristic exponent. In the fermionic sector, the
leading channel corresponds to the regime of parametric excitation of fermions,
which respects Pauli blocking but differs significantly from the perturbative
expectation. In supergravity we also have to consider production of gravitinos
and moduli fields, which are cosmologically dangerous relics. We discuss the
derivation of the gravitino equations in curved space-time with moving
background scalars. We describe recent results on the production of gravitinos
from preheating, which may put strong constraints on the inflationary models.

as a function of energy and photon virtuality in a model combining Regge
exchange, the quark box diagram (a fixed pole in Regge language) and soft and

Good agreement is obtained with the data for the real gamma-gamma cross section
and for the real photon structure function. However the model prediction for
the gamma* gamma* cross section is too small. This is attributed to an
incorrect extrapolation of the Q^2 dependence of the hard pomeron adopted here.
Parametrising it independently shows that the hard part of the cross section
can be well represented by a simple Regge pole with intercept ~ 1.3.

The renormalization procedure is designed to produce a Hamiltonian that will
yield physical states that rapidly converge in an expansion in free-particle
Fock-space sectors. To make this possible, we use light-front field theory to
isolate vacuum effects, and we place a smooth cutoff on the Hamiltonian to
force its free-state matrix elements to quickly decrease as the difference of
the free masses of the states increases. The cutoff violates a number of
physical principles of light-front pure-glue QCD, including Lorentz covariance
and gauge covariance. This means that the operators in the Hamiltonian are not
required to respect these physical principles. However, by requiring the
Hamiltonian to produce cutoff-independent physical quantities and by requiring
it to respect the unviolated physical principles of pure-glue QCD, we are able
to derive recursion relations that define the Hamiltonian to all orders in
perturbation theory in terms of the running coupling. We approximate all
physical states as two-gluon states, and use our recursion relations to
calculate to second order the part of the Hamiltonian that is required to
compute the spectrum. We diagonalize the Hamiltonian using basis-function
expansions for the gluons' color, spin, and momentum degrees of freedom. We
examine the sensitivity of our results to the cutoff and use them to analyze
the nonperturbative scale dependence of the coupling. We investigate the effect
of the dynamical rotational symmetry of light-front field theory on the
rotational degeneracies of the spectrum and compare the spectrum to recent
lattice results. Finally, we examine our wave functions and analyze the various

multi-instantons in the gauge theory and compare with the measure for the
collective coordinates of $(-1)$-branes in the presence of 3- and 7-branes in
type I' theory. We analyse the large-N limit of the measure and find that it
admits two classes of saddle points: In the first class the space of collective
coordinates has the geometry of $AdS_5\times S^3$ which on the string theory
side has the interpretation of the D-instantons being stuck on the 7-branes and
therefore the resulting moduli space being $AdS_5\times S^3$, In the second
class the geometry is $AdS_5\times S^5/Z_2$ and on the string theory side it
means that the D-instantons are free to move in the 10-dimensional bulk. We
discuss in detail a correlator of four O(8) flavour currents on the Yang-Mills
side, which receives contributions from the first type of saddle points only,
and show that it matches with the correlator obtained from $F^4$ coupling on
the string theory side, which receives contribution from D-instantons, in
perfect accord with the AdS/CFT correspondence. In particular we observe that
the sectors with odd number of instantons give contribution to an O(8)-odd
invariant coupling, thereby breaking O(8) down to SO(8) in type I' string
theory. We finally discuss correlators related to $R^4$, which receive

of the Golden Section F=1.618, which is a theoretical ratio, obtained from an
abstract, mathematical theory, which supposedly ought to impress on a painting
a supreme harmony.

A",,"10.1103/PhysRevA.61.042502",,"physics.chem-ph physics.atom-ph",,"  For a three-body system, a quantum wave function $\Psi^\ell_m$ with definite
$\ell$ and $m$ quantum numbers may be expressed in terms of an internal wave
function $\chi^\ell_k$ which is a function of three internal coordinates. This
article provides necessary and sufficient constraints on $\chi^\ell_k$ to
ensure that the external wave function $\Psi^\ell_m$ is analytic. These
constraints effectively amount to boundary conditions on $\chi^\ell_k$ and its
derivatives at the boundary of the internal space. Such conditions find
similarities in the (planar) two-body problem where the wave function (to
lowest order) has the form $r^{|m|}$ at the origin. We expect the boundary
conditions to prove useful for constructing singularity free three-body basis
sets for the case of nonvanishing angular momentum.

three-level system onto level 1 is slowed down because of the further decay of
level 1 onto level 0. It is argued that this phenomenon may be interpreted as a
consequence of the quantum Zeno effect. The reason why this may be possible is
that the second decay (or accompanying photon radiation) may be considered as a
sign of the transition 2 -> 1 so that during the first transition the system is
under continuous observation.

a bath. This decoherence can be avoided by restricting the dynamics of the
system to special decoherence-free subspaces. These subspaces are usually
constructed under the assumption of spatially symmetric system-bath coupling.
Here we show that decoherence-free subspaces may appear without spatial
symmetry. Instead, we consider a model of system-bath interactions in which to
first order only multiple-qubit coupling to the bath is present, with
single-qubit system-bath coupling absent. We derive necessary and sufficient
conditions for the appearance of decoherence-free states in this model, and
give a number of examples. In a sequel paper we show how to perform universal
and fault tolerant quantum computation on the decoherence-free subspaces
considered in this paper.
