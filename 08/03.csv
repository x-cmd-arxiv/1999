lithium test (in 1995), though its inferred mass was very close to the
substellar limit. It is a member of the Pleiades open cluster. Its position in
a cluster color-magnitude diagram suggested that it might be binary, and
preliminary indications that it is a double-lined spectroscopic binary were
reported by us in 1997. Here we report on the results of a consecutive week of
Keck HIRES observations of this system, which yield its orbit. It has a period
of about 5.8 days, and an eccentricity of 0.4+/-0.05. The rotation of the stars
is slow for this class of objects. Because the system luminosity is divided
between 2 objects with a mass ratio of 0.85, this renders each of them an
incontrovertible brown dwarf, with masses between 60-70 jupiters. We show that
component B is a little redder than A by studying their wavelength-dependent
line ratios, and that this variation is compatible with the mass ratio. We
confirm that the system has lithium, but cannot support the original conclusion
that it is depleted (which would be surprising, given the new masses). This is
a system of very close objects which, if they had combined, would have produced
a low mass star. We discuss the implications of this discovery for the theories
of binary formation and formation of very low mass objects.

population of Soft X-ray Weak QSOs (SXW QSOs) where the soft X-ray flux is ~
10-30 times smaller than in typical QSOs. As a first step in a systematic study
of these objects, we establish a well-defined sample of SXW QSOs which includes
all alpha_ox<=-2 QSOs from the Boroson & Green (1992) sample of 87 BQS QSOs.
SXW QSOs comprise about 11% of this optically selected QSO sample. From an
analysis of CIV absorption in the 55 BG92 QSOs with available CIV data, we find
a remarkably strong correlation between alpha_ox and the CIV absorption
equivalent width. This correlation suggests that absorption is the primary
cause of soft X-ray weakness in QSOs, and it reveals a continuum of absorption
properties connecting unabsorbed QSOs, X-ray warm absorber QSOs, SXW QSOs and
BAL QSOs. From a practical point of view, our correlation demonstrates that
selection by soft X-ray weakness is an effective (>=80% successful) and
observationally inexpensive way to find low-redshift QSOs with strong and
interesting ultraviolet absorption. We have also identified several notable
differences between the optical emission-line properties of SXW QSOs and those
of the other BG92 QSOs. SXW QSOs show systematically low [O III] luminosities
as well as distinctive H-beta profiles. They tend to lie toward the weak-[O
III] end of BG92 eigenvector 1, as do many low-ionization BAL QSOs. Unabsorbed
Seyferts and QSOs with similar values of eigenvector 1 have been suggested to
have extreme values of a primary physical parameter, perhaps mass accretion
rate relative to the Eddington rate (M-dot/M-dot_{Edd}). If these suggestions
are correct, it is likely that SXW QSOs also tend to have generally high values
of (M-dot/M-dot_{Edd}). (Abridged)

models of the objects. The spectral line widths show a clear correlation with
ionization potential, which is consistent with the free expansion of a
transonic, ionization-stratified, photoevaporating flow. Fitting models of such
a flow simultaneously to our spectra and HST emission line imaging provides
direct measurements of the proplyd size, ionized density and outflow velocity.
These measurements confirm that the ionization front in the proplyds is
approximately D-critical and provide the most accurate and robust estimate to
date of the proplyd mass loss rate. Values of 0.7E-6 to 1.5E-6 Msun/year are
found for our spectroscopic sample, although extrapolating our results to a
larger sample of proplyds implies that 0.4E-6 Msun/year is more typical of the

circumstellar disks within the proplyds, the length of time that they can have
been exposed to ionizing radiation should not greatly exceed 10,000 years - a
factor of 30 less than the mean age of the proplyd stars. We review the various

current star formation in regions just NE and SE of the quasar and
post-starburst regions with ages up to ~10^8 years in other parts of the host

it is probably near the peak of its starburst activity. Nevertheless, the

frequently involved in the investigation of their phase diagram and transport
properties. We provide a detailed analysis of the harmonic eigenvalues (normal
modes) of the vortex lattice for general values of the magnetic field strength,
going beyond the elastic continuum regime. The detailed behavior of these
wavevector-dependent eigenvalues within the Brillouin zone (BZ), is compared
with several frequently used approximations that we also recalculate.
Throughout the BZ, transverse modes are less costly than their longitudinal
counterparts, and there is an angular dependence which becomes more marked
close to the zone boundary. Based on these results, we propose an analytic
correction to the nonlocal continuum formulas which fits quite well the
numerical behavior of the eigenvalues in the London regime. We use this
approximate expression to calculate thermal fluctuations and the full melting
line (according to Lindeman's criterion) for various values of the anisotropy
parameter.

distributed, heterogeneous, adaptive, dynamic, real-time, interactive,
parallel, secure or other execution. In addition to supporting the application
execution, a TSIA also supports the application definition. This run-time
support for the definition is complementary to the compile-time support of a
compiler. For example, this allows a language similar to Fortran or C to
deliver features promised by functional computing. While many TSIAs exist, they
previously have not been recognized as such and have served only a particular
type of application. Existing TSIAs and other projects demonstrate that TSIAs
are feasible for most applications. As the next paradigm for application
support, the TSIA simplifies and unifies existing computing practice and
research. By solving many outstanding problems, the TSIA opens many, many new

geometrical model. The rotational part of the Lorentz group can be seen to
mutate into the internal iso-group under some additional assumptions. The bound
states can thereafter be characterized by either a triple of spinors (\xi_1,
\xi_2, \eta) or a pair of an average spinor and a ``gauge'' transformation
(\phi, R). Therefore, this triple can be considered to be an isospinor.
Inducing the whole dynamics from the covariant gauge coupling we arrive at an

methods, especially the Hestenes approach to the geometric meaning of spinors,
are the most useful concepts for such a development. The method is not

suppressing the corresponding baryon number violating operators via gauging (a

number violating operators which would result in unacceptably large neutrino
masses can be similarly suppressed via gauging a discrete subgroup of the
lepton number U(1) symmetry. In fact, the four generation feature allows for a
novel higher dimensional mechanism for generating small Majorana neutrino
masses. We also discuss how to achieve gauge coupling unification, which can be
as precise at one loop as in the MSSM, and point out a possible geometric
embedding of the corresponding matter content in the brane world context.
Finally, we discuss adequate suppression of flavor changing neutral currents in

Morita equivalence makes crucial use of an additional modulus on the NCSYM
side, the constant Abelian magnetic background. In this paper, we reanalyze and
clarify the correspondence between M(atrix) theory and NCSYM, and provide two
resolutions of this puzzle. In the first of them, the standard map is kept and
the extra modulus is ignored, but the anomalous transformation is offset by the
M(atrix) theory ``rest term''. In the second, the standard map is modified so
that the duality transformations agree, and a $SO(d)$ symmetry is found to
eliminate the spurious modulus. We argue that this is a true symmetry of
supersymmetric Born-Infeld theory on a non-commutative torus, which allows to
freely trade a constant magnetic background for non-commutativity of the
base-space. We also obtain a BPS mass formula for this theory, invariant under
T-duality, U-duality, and continuous $SO(d)$ symmetry.

especially on the effects of $\beta_{6}$ deformation and low-lying vibrational
excitations of the target nucleus. It is shown that the inclusion of
$\beta_{6}$ deformation leads to a considerable improvement of the fit to the
experimental data for all of these reactions. For the $^{154}$Sm and $^{238}$U
targets, the octupole vibration significantly affects the fusion barrier
distribution. The effect of $\beta$ band is negligible in all the three
reactions, while the $\gamma$ band causes a non-negligible effect on the
barrier distribution at energies above the main fusion barrier. We compare the
optimum values of the deformation parameters obtained by fitting the fusion
data with those obtained from inelastic scatterings and the ground state mass
calculations. We show that the channel coupling of high multipolarity beyond
the quadrupole coupling is dominated by the nuclear coupling and hence higher
order Coulomb coupling does not much influence the optimum values of $\beta_4$
and $\beta_6$ parameters. We also discuss the effect of two neutron transfer

suggesting the existence of sizeable contributions involving more than

as to what features of the effective nucleon-nucleon interaction in the medium

turns out that a combination of a realistic strength of the tensor force
combined with a spin-orbit interaction which is enhanced as compared to the
