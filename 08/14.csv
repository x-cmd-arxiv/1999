been derived using the standard HST Key Project on the Extragalactic Distance
Scale pipeline. For the first time, this allows for a transparent comparison of
data accumulated as part of three different HST projects, the Key Project, the
Sandage et al. Type Ia SNe program, and the Tanvir et al. Leo I Group study.
Re-analyzing the Tanvir et al. galaxy and six Sandage et al. galaxies we find a
mean (weighted) offset in true distance moduli of 0.12+/-0.07 mag -- i.e., 6%
in linear distance -- in the sense of reducing the distance scale, or
increasing H0. Adopting the reddening-corrected Hubble relations of Suntzeff et
al. (1999), tied to a zero point based upon SNe~1990N, 1981B, 1998bu, 1989B,
1972E and 1960F and the photometric calibration of Hill et al. (1998), leads to
a Hubble constant of H0=68+/-2(random)+/-5(systematic) km/s/Mpc. Adopting the
Kennicutt et al. (1998) Cepheid period-luminosity-metallicity dependency
decreases the inferred H0 by 4%. The H0 result from Type Ia SNe is now in good
agreement, to within their respective uncertainties, with that from the
Tully-Fisher and surface brightness fluctuation relations.

supernovae, then allow determination of the Fe enrichment from both types of
supernovae as a function of radius within each cluster. Using optical
measurements from the literature, we also determine the iron mass-to-light
ratio (IMLR) separately for Fe synthesized in both types of supernovae. For
clusters with the best photon statistics, we find that the total Fe abundance
decreases significantly with radius, while the Si abundance is either flat or
decreases less rapidly, resulting in an increasing Si/Fe ratio with radius.
This result indicates a greater predominance of Type II SNe enrichment at large
radii in clusters. We suggest that the high Si/Fe ratios in the outskirts of
rich clusters may arise from enrichment by Type II SNe released to ICM via
galactic star burst driven winds. Abridged.

These observations represent the deepest infrared spectra of a radio galaxy to
date and have allowed for the detection of Hbeta, OIII (4959/5007), OI (6300),
Halpha, NII (6548/6583) and SII (6716/6713). The Halpha emission is very broad
(FWHM~6000 km/s) and strongly supports AGN unification models linking radio
galaxies and quasars. The line ratios are most consistent with a partially
obscured nuclear region and very high excitation. The OIII (5007) line is
extended several arcseconds and shows high velocity clouds in the extended
emission. The nucleus also appears spectrally double and we argue that the
radio galaxy is undergoing a violent merger process. The red galaxy, by
comparison, is very featureless even though we have a good continuum detection
in the H and K bands. We suggest that this object is a foreground galaxy,

Infrared Survey of the southern sky (DENIS) (Epchtein et al. 1997) have
revealed a heretofore unknown population of free brown dwarfs that has extended
the local mass function down to as small as 0.01M_sun (Reid et al. 1999). If
this local proportion of brown dwarfs extends throughout the Galaxy---in
particular in the Galactic bulge---one expects an increase in the predicted
fraction of short time scale microlensing events in directions toward the
Galactic bulge. Zhao et al.(1996) have indicated that a mass function with
30-60% of the lens mass in brown dwarfs is not consistent with empirical
microlensing data. Here we show that even the much lower mass fraction (~ 10%)
of brown dwarfs inferred from the new discoveries appears inconsistent with the
data. The added brown dwarfs do indeed increase the expected number of short
time scale events, but they appear to drive the peak in the time scale
frequency distribution to time scales smaller than that observed, and do not
otherwise match the observed distribution. A reasonably good match to the
empirical data (Alcock et al. 1996) is obtained by increasing the fraction of
stars in the range 0.08<m<0.7M_sun considerably above that deduced from several
star counts. However, all inferences from microlensing about the appropriate
stellar mass function must be qualified by the meagerness of the microlensing
data and the uncertainties in the Galactic model.

potential ambiguities connected with inhomogeneous Malmquist bias corrections.
The results from the SFI sample are compared with linear-theory predictions. We
generate a large set of mock samples, extracted from N-body simulations, which
are used to assess the reliability of our analysis and to estimate the
associated uncertainties. Defining $\eta_8=\sigma_8\Omega_0^{0.6}$, we find

unstable hydrogen burning via CNO cycling. Our calculations show that such
thermal instabilities are restricted to a certain mass range
(M=0.21...0.30Msun), consistent with earlier studies. Models within this mass
range undergo the more hydrogen shell flashes the less massive they are. This
is caused by the strong dependence of the envelope mass on the white dwarf core
mass. The maximum luminosities from hydrogen burning during the flashes are of
the order of 10^5 Lsun. Because of the development of a pulse-driven convection
zone whose upper boundary temporarily reaches the surface layers, the
envelope's hydrogen content decreases by Delta(X)=0.06 per flash. Our study
further shows that an additional high mass-loss episode during a flash-driven
Roche lobe overflow to the white dwarf's companion does not affect the final
cooling behaviour of the models. Independent of hydrogen shell flashes the
evolution along the final white dwarf cooling branch is determined by hydrogen
burning via pp-reactions down to effective temperatures as low as 8000 K.

sine-Gordon form. We argue that the perturbative renormalization group flow of
this chiral sine-Gordon theory is distinct from the standard (non-chiral)
sine-Gordon theory, contrary to a previous assertion by Renn, and that the
theory is manifestly sensible only at a discrete set of values of the inverse
period of the cosine interaction (beta). We obtain exact solutions for the
spectra and correlation functions of the chiral sine-Gordon theory at the two
values of beta at which the electron tunneling in bilayers is not irrelevant.
Of these, the marginal case (beta^2=4) is of greatest interest: the spectrum of
the interacting theory is that of two Majorana fermions with different,
dynamically generated, velocities. For the experimentally observed bilayer 331
state at filling factor 1/2, this implies the trifurcation of electrons added
to the edge. We also present a method for fermionizing the theory at the
discrete points (integer beta^2) by the introduction of auxiliary degrees of

multilayers.

It is found that the presence of nonmagnetic layers has a strong effect on the
magnetic properties of thin films. The Curie temperatures of very thin films
are modified by the uncorrelated overlayers. The quasiparticle density of
states is used to analyze the results. In addition, the coupling between the
ferromagnetic layers and the nonmagnetic layers is discussed in detail. The
coupling depends on the band occupation of the nonmagnetic layers, while it is
almost independent of the number of the nonmagnetic layers. The induced
polarization in the nonmagnetic layers shows a long-range decreasing
oscillatory behavior and it depends on the coupling between ferromagnetic and

proton beam and a $\sim$27.6 GeV electron beam, the polarized HERA will enable
$\vec{e}-\vec{p}$ collisions with $\sqrt{s} \sim 300$ GeV and access spin
variables in the kinematic range, $10^{-5} \le x_{\rm Bj} \le 0.6$ and $0 \le
Q^{2} \le 10^{5}$, using the H1 and ZEUS detectors at DESY. This will be an
increase of two orders of magnitude in both $x$ and $Q^{2}$ range compared to
the presently explored range from fixed target experiments at CERN, SLAC and
DESY. No other approved or planned spin experiment or accelerator facility will
access the low $x$ and high $Q^{2}$ regions possible with HERA. Measurements
performed with the polarized HERA collider will include the polarized structure
function $g_{1}(x,Q^{2})$ at very low $x$, the polarized gluon distribution
$\Delta G(x,Q^{2})$ from pQCD analysis of $g_{1}$, and from the production of
di-jet events and high-p$_{T}$ hadrons in photon gluon fusion process and in
photoproduction, the weak structure functions, the valence quark distribution
functions from semi-inclusive asymmetries, parton distributions inside
polarized photon, and information on helicity structure of possible new physics
beyond the standard model. With such a rich and broad physics program possible
for HERA,not polarizing the proton beam would be a great opportunity lost.

kinematics of the inclusions. The latter is described via Ito stochastic
differential equation. In addition to stochastic forces, the inclusions also
experience membrane-induced deterministic forces. Our aim is to simulate the
diffusion-driven aggregation of inclusions and show how the external inclusions
arrive at the sites of the embedded inclusions. The model has potential use in
such emerging fields as designing a targeted drug delivery system.

hamiltonian depends on a single parameter shows degeneracies (crossings) when
the parameter varies. We derive a semiclassical expression for the density of
crossings in the plane energy-parameter, that is the number of crossings per
unit of energy and unit of parameter, in terms of classical periodic orbits. We
compare the results of the semiclassical formula with exact quantum
calculations for two specific quantum integrable billiards.
