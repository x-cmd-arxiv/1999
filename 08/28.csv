proposed based on probabilistic grounds, as the LMC measure (Phys. Lett. A {\bf
209} (1995) 321) or the SDL measure (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 59}
  (1999) 2). All these measures share an intuitive consideration: complexity
seems to emerge in nature close to instability points, as for example the phase
transition points characteristic of critical phenomena. Here we discuss these
measures and their reliability for detecting complexity close to critical
points in complex systems composed of many interacting units. Both a
two-dimensional spatially extended problem (the 2D Ising model) and a
$\infty$-dimensional (random graph) model (random Boolean networks) are
analysed. It is shown that the LMC and the SDL measures can be easily
generalized to extended systems but fails to detect real complexity.

the time-dependent evolution of the disk height and consequent blocking of the
outer disk by the inner and middle portions of the disk from the direct
irradiation is included. The direct irradiation of the disk by inner layers
where the soft X-ray flux is generated is found to have only a small effect on
the outer disk because of shadowing. Mild indirect irradiation that flattens,
but otherwise does not affect the light curve substantially, still has
interesting non-linear effects on the structure of the disk as heating and
cooling waves propagate. The irradiated disks do not always make simple
transitions between the hot and cold states, but can linger at intermediate
temperatures or even return temporarily to the hot state, depending on the
irradiation and the activity in adjacent portions of the disk.

The spatial analysis yields clear evidence that this emission is extended in

the {\it main} origin of the X-ray emission in NGC 253. For M82, the presence
of an Fe-K line at ~ 6.7 keV, and the convex profile of its 2-10 keV continuum,

properties of microjansky sources to flux densities greater than 40 $\mu$Jy at
1.4 GHz and greater than 8 $\mu$Jy at 8.5 GHz. A total of 371 sources have been
catalogued at 1.4 GHz as part of a complete sample within 20\arcmin ~of the
HDF. The differential source count for this region is only marginally
sub-Euclidean and is given by $n(S) = (8.3 \pm 0.4) S^{-2.4 \pm 0.1}$

systematically lower in the HDF as compared to other fields. We conclude that

identification with disk-type systems at $z \sim $ 0.5-0.8 suggests that
synchrotron emission, produced by supernovae remnants, is powering the radio
emission in the majority of sources. The 8.5 GHz sample contains primarily
moderately flat spectrum sources ($\bar{\alpha}_{8.5} = 0.35$), with less than
15% inverted. We argue that we may be observing an increased fraction of
optically thin bremsstrahlung over synchrotron radiation in these distant

the companion paper by Tregillis et al. 1999). The cosmic-ray particle
simulations can follow the effects of shock acceleration, second-order Fermi
acceleration as well as radiative and adiabatic energy losses. We have applied
this scheme to 2-D and 3-D MHD simulations of jet-driven flows and have begun
to explore links between dynamics and the properties of high energy electron
populations in radio lobes. The key initial discovery is the great importance
to the high energy particle population of the very unsteady and inhomogeneous
flows, especially near the end of the jet. Because of this, in particular, our
simulations show that a large fraction of the particle population flowing from
the jet into the cocoon never passes through strong shocks. The shock strengths
encountered are not simply predicted by 1-D models, and are quite varied.
Consequently, the emergent electron spectra are highly heterogeneous. Rates of
synchrotron aging in ""hot-spots"" seem similarly to be very uneven, enhancing
complexity in the spectral properties of electrons as they emerge into the

dramatic change in water's dynamic and structural properties as a function of

masses of supersymmetric partners of the SM particles are close to the weak
scale. In this thesis, we argue that the supersymmetric Standard Model, while
avoiding the fine tuning in electroweak symmetry breaking, requires
unnaturalness/fine tuning in some (other) sector of the theory. For example,
Baryon and Lepton number violating operators are allowed which lead to proton
decay and flavor changing neutral currents. We study some of the constraints
from the latter in this thesis. We have to impose an R-parity for the theory to
be both natural and viable. In the absence of flavor symmetries, the
supersymmetry breaking masses for the squarks and sleptons lead to too large
flavor changing neutral currents. We show that two of the solutions to this
problem, gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking and making the scalars of
the first two generations heavier than a few TeV, reintroduce fine tuning in
electroweak symmetry breaking. We also construct a model of low energy gauge
mediation with a non-minimal messenger sector which improves the fine tuning
and also generates required Higgs mass terms. We show that this model can be
derived from a Grand Unified Theory despite the non-minimal spectrum.

appropriate as the conventional one and that they lead, assuming the micro-

studies on the LF of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), of the degenerate
vacua in Schwinger model (SM) and Chiral SM (CSM), of the chiral boson theory,
and of the QCD in covariant gauges among others. The discussion on the LF is
more economical and more transparent. In the context of the Dyson-Wick pertur-
bation theory the relevant popagators in the front form theory are causal. The
Wick rotation can then be performed to employ the Euclidean space integrals in
momentum space. The lack of manifest covariance becomes tractable, and still
more so if we employ, as discussed in the text, the Fourier transform of the
fermionic field based on a special construction of the LF spinor. The fact that
the hyperplanes $x^{pm}=0$ constitute characteristic surfaces of the hyper-
bolic partial differential equation is found irrelevant in the quantized

  It is globally convergent, with probability 1. All quantities involved in the
computation are bounded, once the initial polynomial is given (with probability
1). This implies remarkable stability properties for the new algorithm, thus
overcoming known limitations of the classical Graeffe algorithm. If we start
with a degree-$d$ polynomial, each renormalized Graeffe iteration costs
$O(d^2)$ arithmetic operations, with memory $O(d)$. A probabilistic global
complexity bound is given. The case of univariate real polynomials is briefly
discussed. A numerical implementation of the algorithm presented herein allowed

from the sewing of two spheres (resp., superspheres) with tubes in
