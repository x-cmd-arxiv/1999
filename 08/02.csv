incorporate corrections for the nonlinear density evolution and redshift-space
distortion in the formula in a phenomenological manner which is consistent with
recent numerical simulations. On the basis of this formula, we predict the
power spectrum of galaxies and quasars on the light cone for future redshift

galaxy MS 1512-cB58, obtained with LRIS on the Keck I telescope and covering
the rest frame far-UV from 1150 to 1930 A. Gravitational lensing by a
foreground cluster boosts the flux from cB58 by a factor of about 30 and
provides the opportunity for a first quantitative study of the physical
properties of star forming galaxies at high redshift. Our main results are as
follows. The ultraviolet spectral properties of cB58 are remarkably similar to
those of nearby star forming galaxies. The P-Cygni profiles of CIV and NV are
best matched by continuous star formation with a Salpeter IMF extending beyond
50 solar masses---we find no evidence for either a flatter IMF (at the high
mass end), or an IMF deficient in the most massive stars. There are clues in
our data that the metallicity of both the stars and the gas is a few times
below solar. Our best estimate, approximately equal to 1/4 solar, is 3 times
higher than the typical metallicity of damped Lyman alpha systems at the same
redshift, consistent with the proposal that the galaxies which dominate the H I
absorption cross-section are generally forming stars at a slower rate than L*
Lyman break galaxies like cB58. The relative velocities of the stellar lines,
interstellar absorption, and H II emission indicate the existence of
large-scale outflows in the interstellar medium of cB58, with a bulk outward
motion of 200 km/s and a mass loss rate of approximately 60 solar masses per
year, roughly comparable to the star formation rate. Such galactic winds may
well be the mechanism which self-regulates star formation, distributes metals
over large volumes and allows the escape of ionizing photons into the IGM.

that the blue, small sources which dominate the faint IR counts are not
compatible with a high redshift ($z>1$) population. On the contrary, the
observed color and compactness trends, together with the absence of a turnover
at faint magnitudes and the dominance of small sources, can be naturally
explained by an increasing contribution of sub-$L^*$ galaxies when going to
fainter apparent magnitudes. Such evidence strongly supports the existence of a
steeply rising ($\alpha\ll-1$) faint end of the local infrared luminosity
function of galaxies - at least for luminosities $L<0.01L^*$.

gradient of the gamma-ray intensity compared to the inferred CR source
distribution in the Galactic disk. In diffusive CR propagation models the most
natural explanation is very efficient spatial mixing due to MHD turbulence in
the interstellar medium. However, even in the most favorable case of a very
large diffusive CR halo the gamma-ray gradient is still larger than observed.
In our view such a small gradient could be the result of strong advection by a
Galactic wind. We show that a small gamma-ray gradient can be obtained, if the
diffusion region does NOT extend far above the Galactic plane. Important
ingredients of our model are: (i) anisotropic CR diffusion, (ii) strong radial
and vertical gradients of the advection velocity (due to faster winds above

with an orbital period of 2.16 hours which contains a subdwarf B star (sdB) and
a white dwarf. There are two main results of this work. First, the light curve
of KPD 0422+5421 contains two distinct periodic signals, the 2.16 hour
ellipsoidal modulation discovered by Koen, Orosz, & Wade (1998) and an
additional modulation at 7.8 hours. This 7.8 hour modulation is clearly not
sinusoidal: the rise time is about 0.25 in phase, whereas the decay time is
0.75 in phase. Its amplitude is roughly half of the amplitude of the
ellipsoidal modulation. Second, after the 7.8 hour modulation is removed, the
light curve folded on the orbital period clearly shows the signature of the
transit of the white dwarf across the face of the sdB star and the signature of
the occultation of the white dwarf by the sdB star. We used the Wilson-Devinney
code to model the light curve to obtain the inclination, the mass ratio, and
the Omega potentials, and a Monte Carlo code to compute confidence limits on
interesting system parameters. We find component masses of M_sdB = 0.36 +/-
0.16 solar masses and M_WD = 0.47 +/- 0.16 solar masses (M_total = 0.86 +/-
0.35 solar masses, 68 per cent confidence limits). If we impose an additional
constraint and require the computed mass and radius of the white dwarf to be
consistent with a theoretical mass-radius relation, we find M_sdB = 0.511
+0.047 -0.050 solar masses and M_WD = 0.526 +0.033 -0.030 solar masses (68 per
cent confidence limits). In this case the total mass of the system is less than
1.4 solar masses at the 99.99 per cent confidence level. We briefly discuss

corroborate its predicted scaling form, in the case of the 3d Ising
universality class. We show that the scaling behavior emerges clearly when one
accounts for the effects of the negative background constant contribution to
the canonical critical specific heat. We show that this same constant plays a
significant role in determining the observed differences between the canonical
and microcanonical specific heats of systems of finite size, in the critical
region.

motion with friction are introduced to describe the time evolution of the
chiral condensates within the framework of the linear $\sigma$ model. Four
types of friction are used to study how the result is sensitive to the choice
of the friction. For the thermalization stage, the time dependent temperature
is parameterized so as to simulate the result of the parton-cascade model. It
is parameterized according to the one dimensional scaling hydrodynamics for the
subsequent cooling stage. The time development of the condensates and the
entropy production due to friction are calculated numerically. The time
interval in which the chiral symmetry is restored approximately is investigated
in detail for four types of friction. It is found that; (i) the maximum
temperature must be high enough (not lower than 230 MeV) and the friction must
be strong enough in order that the chiral symmetry restoration lasts for a long
time (not shorter than 3fm/c); (ii) the ratio of time interval in which chiral
symmetry is restored, to the time interval in which the temperature is higher
than the critical temperature is typically 0.5 when the friction is strong
enough; and (iii) the entropy due to the friction is mainly produced in the
early stage of the cooling. The effect of freezeout is discussed briefly.

""Quantum Groups"" held in Durham 19-29 July 1999. We give a survey on cyclotomic

to Specht module theory of cyclotomic Hecke algebras constructed by Dipper,
James and Mathas. In lecture two, we explain Ginzburg and Lusztig's theory on
affine Hecke algebras and its application to cyclotomic Hecke algebras due to
the author. As Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of Hecke algebras describe decomposition
numbers of quantum algebras at roots of unity, canonical bases of quantum
affine algebras on integrable modules describe decomposition numbers of
cyclotomic Hecke algebras at roots of unity. In particular, it turns out that
crystal structure in the sense of Kashiwara exists behind the representation
theory of cyclotomic Hecke algebras. This was first observed by Lascoux,
Leclerc and Thibon. Its interpretation in terms of socle series was proposed by
Rouquier. It is further developed in Vazirani's thesis. The special case of
Hecke algebras of type A is extensively studied, and its relation to Lusztig
conjecture is now very clear. We explain Varagnolo and Vasserot's work and
several algorithms proposed so far. Its application to the decomposition
numbers of finite general linear groups due to Dipper and James is also
explained. The parametrization of simple modules of cyclotomic Hecke algebras
over arbitrary fields in terms of crystal graphs of quantum affine algebras is
given by Mathas and the author. In the third lecture, we show that this crystal
graph description fits well in the Specht module theory. It uses work of

Novikov completion of the group ring of the fundamental group of $M$. Its
abelianization coincides with the logarithm of the twisted Lefschetz zeta

Investigation on their properties, together with similar studies on low-lying

boson-type excitations holds in the finite fermion systems like atomic nuclei.
  The main attention in this review is paid to double giant dipole resonances
(DGDR) which are observed in relativistic heavy ion collisions with very large
cross sections. A great experimental and theoretical effort is underway to
understand the reaction mechanism which leads to the excitation of these states
in nuclei, as well as the better microscopic understanding of their properties.
The Coulomb mechanism of the excitation of single and double giant resonances
in heavy ion collision at different projectile energies is discussed in
details. A contribution of the nuclear excitation to the total cross section of
the reaction is also considered. The Coulomb excitation of double resonances is
described within both, the second-order perturbation theory approach and in
coupled-channels calculation. The properties of single and double resonances
are considered within the phenomenologic harmonic vibrator model and
microscopic quasiparticle-RPA approach. For the last we use the
Quasiparticle-Phonon Model (QPM) the basic ideas and formalism of which are
presented. The QPM predictions of the DGDR properties (energy centroids,
widths, strength distributions, anharmonicities and excitation cross sections)
are compared to predictions of harmonic vibrator model, results of other
microscopic calculations and experimental data available.
