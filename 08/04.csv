'', has been proposed recently to explain cosmic acceleration with a dynamical
cosmological constant. Such a field is expected to be coupled explicitely to
ordinary matter, unless some unknown symmetry prevents it. I investigate the
cosmological consequences of such a coupled quintessence (CQ) model, assuming
an exponential potential and a linear coupling. This model is conformally
equivalent to Brans-Dicke Lagrangians with power-law potential. I evaluate the
density perturbations on the cosmic microwave background and on the galaxy
distribution at the present and derive bounds on the coupling constant from the
comparison with observational data.
  A novel feature of CQ is that during the matter dominated era the scalar
field has a finite and almost constant energy density. This epoch, denoted as
$\phi $MDE, is responsible of several differences with respect to uncoupled
quintessence: the multipole spectrum of the microwave background is tilted at
large angles, the acoustic peaks are shifted, their amplitude is changed, and
the present 8Mpc$/h$ density variance is diminished. The present data constrain
the dimensionless coupling constant to $|\beta |\leq 0.1$.

the Dwarf starts with 10^9 Solar Mass and Galactocentric distance 60 kpc,

dark-matter dominated and the current velocity dispersion of the Dwarf's dark

largely affected by current uncertainties in other important physical processes

states on a microscopic basis.
  The incoming boundary condition is employed in solving coupled-channels
equations, which enables us to define the flux for complete fusion inside the
Coulomb barrier. It is shown that complete fusion cross sections are
significantly enhanced due to the couplings to the continuum states compared
with the no coupling case at energies below the Coulomb barrier, while they are
hindered at above barrier energies.

chiral condensates in heavy ion collisions. We show that the variance in the
number of charged pions (in a suitable range of momentum space) provides a
signature for the observation of a disoriented chiral condensate. The signal
should be observable even if multiple domains of D$\chi$C form provided the
average number of pions per domain is significantly larger than unity. The
variance of the number charged pions alone provides a signal which can be used
even if the number of neutral pions cannot be measured in a given detector. On
the other hand, the probability distribution in $R$, the proportion of neutral
pions to all pions emitted in heavy ion collisions in certain kinematic
regions, has been suggested as a signal of a disoriented chiral condensate.
Here we note that the signature can be greatly enhanced by making suitable cuts
in the data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$
pions with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R>$
can be substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\chi$C
domain without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5
given the pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with
lowest $p_T$ are both neutral, {\it etc.}. The effects of multi-domain D$\chi$C
formation and noise due to incoherent pion emission can be systematically
incorporated. Potential applications to experiments and their limitations are
briefly discussed.

  The effect of the energy sharing between the parallel and transverse neutron
momentum distributions is taken into account thus resulting in a theory which
is more general than sudden eikonal approaches. Both effects are necessary to
understand properly the breakup from not too weakly bound $l_i>1$ orbitals.
Breakup which leaves the core into an excited state below particle threshold is
also considered. The core-target interaction is treated in the smooth cut-off
approximation. By comparing to presently available experimental data we show
how to make some hypothesis on the quantum numbers and occupancy of the neutron
initial state. Possible ambiguities in the interpretation of inclusive cross
sections are discussed.

which is taken for granted, results from the spinorial behaviour of Fermions,
which constitute the material content of the universe. It is shown that the
resulting three dimensionality rests on two factors which have been hitherto
ignored, viz., a Machian or holistic property and the stochastic underpinning
of the universe itself. However the dimensionality is scale dependent in the
sense that at very large scales, or at very small scales, we encounter a
different dimensionality, as indeed is borne out by observation and experiment.
For example the large scale structures in the universe are cellular in nature
on the one hand, and we encounter fractional charges and handedness at very
small scales. Finally it is shown how fractal dimensions can emerge and as an
illustrative example it is shown how this could explain the magnetism of
objects like Planets on the one hand and White Dwarf stars and Pulsars on the
other.

shown that the introduction of a second order approximation in the propagator
of a particle, immersed in the Earth's gravitational field, and whose
coordinates are being continuously monitored, allows us to include, in the
corresponding complex oscillator, a frequency which now depends on the geometry
of the source of the gravitational field, a fact that is absent in the case of
a homogeneous field. Using this propagator we will analyze the interference
pattern of two particle beams whose coordinates are being continuously
monitored. We will compare our results againt the case of a homogeneous field,
and also against the measurement ouputs of the Colella, Overhauser, and Werner
experiment, and find that the difference in the dependence upon the geometry of
the source of the gravitational field could render detectable differences in
their respective measurement outputs.
