models. Using the permutation between two alleles, between two loci, and
between being affected and unaffected, one model can be considered to be
equivalent to another model under the corresponding permutation. These
permutations greatly reduce the number of two-locus models in the analysis of
complex diseases. This paper determines the number of non-redundant two-locus
models (which can be 102, 100, 96, 51, 50, or 48, depending on which
permutations are used, and depending on whether zero-locus and single-locus
models are excluded). Whenever possible, these non-redundant two-locus models
are classified by their property. Besides the familiar features of
multiplicative models (logical AND), heterogeneity models (logical OR), and
threshold models, new classifications are added or expanded: modifying-effect
models, logical XOR models, interference and negative interference models
(neither dominant nor recessive), conditionally dominant/recessive models,
missing lethal genotype models, and highly symmetric models. The following
aspects of two-locus models are studied: the marginal penetrance tables at both
loci, the expected joint identity-by-descent probabilities, and the correlation
between marginal identity-by-descent probabilities at the two loci. These
studies are useful for linkage analyses using single-locus models while the
underlying disease model is two-locus, and for correlation analyses using the
linkage signals at different locations obtained by a single-locus model.

  Journal",,"10.1086/308177",,"astro-ph",,"  Magnetic connections to the plunging region can exert stresses on the inner
edge of an accretion disk around a black hole. We recompute the relativistic
corrections to the thin-disk dynamics equations when these stresses take the
form of a time-steady torque on the inner edge of the disk. The additional
dissipation associated with these stresses is concentrated relatively close
outside the marginally stable orbit, scaling as r to the -7/2 at large radius.
As a result of these additional stresses: spin-up of the central black hole is
retarded; the maximum spin-equilibrium accretion efficiency is 36%, and occurs
at a/M=0.94; the disk spectrum is extended toward higher frequencies; line
profiles (such as Fe K-alpha) are broadened if the line emissivity scales with
local flux; limb-brightening, especially at the higher frequencies, is
enhanced; and the returning radiation fraction is substantially increased, up
to 58%. This last effect creates possible explanations for both synchronized
continuum fluctuations in AGN, and polarization rises shortward of the Lyman
edge in quasars. We show that no matter what additional stresses occur, when
a/M < 0.36, the second law of black hole dynamics sets an absolute upper bound
on the accretion efficiency.

wake-like structure and particle grouping (clump) arises spontaneously due to
gravitational instability and the radial velocity dispersion increases as the
formation of the wake structure. However, intrinsic physics of the phenomena
has not been clarified. We performed local $N$-body simulations including
mutual gravitational forces between ring particles as well as direct
(inelastic) collisions with identical (up to $N\sim40000$) particles. In the
wake structure particles no longer move randomly but coherently. We found that
particle motion was similar to Keplerian motion even in the wake structure and
that the coherent motion was produced since the particles in a clump had
similar eccentricity and longitude of perihelion. This coherent motion causes
the increase and oscillation in the radial velocity dispersion. The mean
velocity dispersion is rather larger in a more dissipative case with a smaller
restitution coefficient and/or a larger surface density since the coherence is
stronger in the more dissipative case. Our simulations showed that the
wavelength of the wake structure was approximately given by the longest
wavelength $\hs{\lambda}{cr} = 4\pi^2 G\Sigma/\kappa^2$ in the linear theory of
axisymmetric gravitational instability in a thin disk, where $G$, $\Sigma$, and

with and without the effects of radiative cooling, but neglecting the effects
of star formation and feedback. We show that radiative cooling produces an
inflow of high-entropy gas from the outer parts of the cluster, thus
\emph{raising} the cluster temperature and \emph{decreasing} the X-ray
luminosity. With radiative cooling clusters are on average three to five times
less luminous in X-rays than the same cluster simulated without cooling.
However, we do not produce a large constant-density core in either the gas or
the dark matter distributions. Our results contradict previous work in which
cooling raises the X-ray luminosity and deposits an unreasonably large amount
of mass in the central cluster galaxy. We achieve this by selecting our
numerical resolution in such a way that a reasonable fraction of the baryonic
material cools and by decoupling the hot and cold gas in our simulations, a
first step towards modelling multiphase gas. We emphasise that globally cooling
a sensible amount of material is vital and the presence or absence of massive
central concentrations of cold baryonic material has a dramatic effect upon the
resultant X-ray properties of the clusters.

the hard X-ray Background provided that most of the radiation produced during
their growth was absorbed by surrounding gas. A simple model is proposed here
for the formation of galaxy bulges and central black holes in which young
spheroidal galaxies have a significant distributed component of cold dusty
clouds which accounts for the absorption. The central accreting black hole is
assumed to emit both a quasar-like spectrum, which is absorbed by the
surrounding gas, and a slow wind. The power in both is less than the Eddington
limit for the black hole. The wind however exerts the most force on the gas
and, as earlier suggested by Silk & Rees, when the black hole reaches a
critical mass, it is powerful enough to eject the cold gas from the galaxy, so
terminating the growth of both black hole and galaxy. In the present model this
point occurs when the Thomson depth in the surrounding gas has dropped to about
unity and results in the mass of the black hole being proportional to the mass
of the spheroid, with the normalization agreeing with that found for local
galaxies by Magorrian et al. for reasonable wind parameters. The model predicts
a new population of hard X-ray and sub-mm sources at redshifts above one which
are powered by black holes in their main growth phase.

in addition to an almost equally luminous F star (T_eff ~ 7250 K). The 5-195
micron SWS and LWS spectra are dominated by strong emission from circumstellar
dust. We find that the dust consists of amorphous silicates, with a minor but
significant contribution from crystalline silicates. The amorphous silicates
consist of Fe-rich olivines. The presence of amorphous pyroxenes cannot be
excluded but if present they contain much less Fe than the amorphous olivines.
Comparison with laboratory data shows that the pure Mg-end members of the
crystalline olivine and pyroxene solid solution series are present. In
addition, we find strong evidence for simple oxides (FeO and Al2O3) as well as
crystalline H2O ice. Several narrow emission features remain unidentified.

large grains (~1 micron) must be present and that the abundance of the
crystalline silicates is between 7 and 15% of the total dust mass, depending on

angular-redshift samples of galaxies within Clusters. The method relies on the
use of Discrete Wavelet Transform (hereafter DWT) and has already been applied
to the analysis of the Coma cluster (Gambera et al. 1997). The main new
ingredient of our method with respect to previous studies lies in the fact that
we make use of a 3D data set rather than a 2D. We test the method on mock
cluster catalogs with spatially localized substructures and on a N-body
simulation. Our main conclusion is that our method is able to identify the
existing substructures provided that: a) the subclumps are detached in part or
all of the phase space, b) one has a statistically significant number of
redshifts, increasing as the distance decreases due to redshift distortions; c)
one knows {\it a priori} the scale on which substructures are to be expected.
We have found that to allow an accurate recovery we must have both a
significant number of galaxies ($\approx 200$ for clusters at z$\geq 0.4$ or
about 800 at z$\leq$ 0.4) and a limiting magnitude for completeness $m_B=16$.
The only true limitation to our method seems to be the necessity of knowing
{\it a priori} the scale on which the substructure is to be found. This is an
intrinsic drawback of the method and no improvement in numerical codes based on
this technique could make up for it.

partitions - by channel, frequency, and time interval, we show that the
observed non-Gaussian signal is driven by the 53 GHz data. This frequency
dependence strongly rejects the hypothesis that the signal is cosmological in
origin. A jack-knife analysis of the coadded 53 and 90 GHz sky maps reveals
those sky pixels to which the bispectrum statistic is particularly sensitive.
We find that by removing data from the 53 GHz sky maps for periods of time
during which a known systematic effect perturbs the 31 GHz channels, the
amplitudes of the bispectrum coefficients become completely consistent with
that expected for a Gaussian sky. We conclude that the non-Gaussian signal
detected by the normalised bispectrum statistic in the publicly available DMR

a high-density phase favored at high pressures, and to the appearance of a
point $C'$ at a positive pressure, which is the analog of the T=0 ``critical

model of non-interacting composite fermions, although some inconsistencies
remain when the two-dimensional electron system is tilted in the magnetic

solutions of the scalar-fields energy $\rho_s$ which behaves truly constant for

variations. This causes a mini-inflation, as indicated by recent observations.
As another novel feature, $\rho_s$ and the ordinary matter density $\rho_m$
fall off always side by side, but interlacing, also like (time)$^{-2}$ as an
overall behavior in conformity with the scenario of a decaying cosmological
constant. A mini-inflation occurs whenever $\rho_s$ overtakes $\rho_m$, which
may happen more than once, shedding a new light on the coincidence problem. We
present a new example of the solution, and offer an intuitive interpretation of

cosmic rays with energies beyond the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. The red
shift acts as a cosmological filter selecting the sources at some particular
value z_e, for which the present neutrino energy is close to the Z pole of the
annihilation cross section. We predict no directional correlation of the
ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays with the galactic halo. At the same time, there
can be some directional correlations in the data, reflecting the distribution
of matter at red shift z=z_e. Both of these features are manifest in the
existing data. Our scenario is consistent with the neutrino mass reported by
Super-Kamiokande and requires no lepton asymmetry or clustering of the
background neutrinos.

This decoupling suggests that the quantum states supported in the near-horizon

transversely expanding medium. It is shown that the yield of secondary $J/\psi$
mesons depends strongly on the $J/\psi$ dissociation cross section with
co-moving hadrons. Within the most likely scenario for the dissociation cross
section it will be negligible. The secondary production of $\psi^,$ mesons,
however, due to their large cross section above the threshold, can
substantially exceed the primary yield.

that genuine photon spin singlets are emitted in predetermined directions even
when incident photons are unpolarized, has been used in a proposal for an
experiment that imposes quantum spin correlation on truly independent photons.
In the experiment, two photons from two such singlets interfere at a beam
splitter, and as a result the other two photons - which nowhere interacted and
whose paths nowhere crossed - exhibit a 100% correlation in polarization, even
when no polarization has been measured in the first two photons. The propsed
experiment permits closure of the remaining loopholes in the Bell theorem proof
and reveals the quantum nonlocality as a property of selection, and pioneers an
experimental procedure for exact preparation of unequal superposition.

tunneling in a model system studied by Kilin et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76 (1996)

potential which is coupled by a strong laser field to an excited state
asymmetric double-well potential. By analyzing the assumptions used in their
analysis we show that the suppression of quantum dynamical tunneling can be
explained with the use of dark and bright states of the system. We also
generalize the system and the conditions for suppression of quantum tunneling
and show that, in certain cases, suppression can occur regardless the
characteristics of the excited potential surface.
