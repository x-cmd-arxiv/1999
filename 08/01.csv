emphasis on the different approaches and concepts that have been used in the
past. In particular the outstanding contribution of Franz Kahn to our physical
understanding is appreciated. It is argued that galactic outflows represent an
essential phase during galaxy evolution. The dynamics of the outflow imprints
its signature on the emission spectra of soft X-rays, which may well be
observable with AXAF and XMM. Finally, some remarks about winds in starburst
galaxies and AGN are made.

the cluster environment, the synthesized cosmic star formation rate (SFR) has
an excess at $z \gtsim 3$ corresponding to the early star burst in ellipticals

1.4$ compared with Madau's plot. In the field environment, we assume that
ellipticals form over a wide range of redshifts as $1 \ltsim z \ltsim 4$. The
synthesized cosmic SFR has a broad peak around $z \sim 3$, which is in good
agreement with the observed one. The resultant cosmic SFRs lead to the
following predictions for the cosmic SN Ia rate: 1) The SN Ia rate in spirals
has a break at $z \sim 2$ due to the low-metallicity inhibition of SNe Ia,
regardless of clusters or field. 2) At high redshifts, the SN Ia rate has a
strong peak around $z \sim 3$ in clusters, whereas in field much lower rate is
expected, reflecting the difference in the formation epochs of ellipticals.

an explicit analytic class of maps to the physical space, a basis of solutions
for infinite fluid in an infinitely long channel, characterized by meromorphic
derivatives. We verify that these maps never lose analyticity in the course of
temporal evolution, thus justifying the underlying machinery. However, the
great bulk of these solutions can lose conformality in time, this the
circumstance of finite-time singularities. By considerations of the nature of
the analyticity of all these solutions, we show that those free of such
singularities inevitably result in a {\em single} asymptotic ""finger"". This is
purely nonlinear behavior: the very early ""finger"" actually already has a
waist, this having signalled the end of any linear regime. The single ""finger""
has nevertheless an arbitrary width determined by initial conditions. This is
in contradiction with the experimental results that indicate selection of a
finger of width 1/2. In the last part of this paper we motivate that such a

This is a strong signal that {\em finiteness} is determinative of pattern
selection.

dies off at fixed $r$ as $t^{-2|s|-3}$ --- as in the Schwarzschild background.
(ii) However, other modes admit decay rates slower than in the Schwarzschild
