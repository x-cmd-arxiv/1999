direction of the previously unknown, optically inactive galaxy pair
RXJ1242.6-1119. The X-ray source shows variability by a factor > 20 between the
ROSAT all-sky survey and a later pointed observation separated by ~1.5 yr. Its
spectrum is extremely soft with photon index Gamma_x ~ -5, among the steepest
ever observed among galaxies. Based on the redshift derived from the optical
spectra, z=0.05, the source's intrinsic luminosity is large, L_x > 9x10^{43}
erg/s. Surprisingly, the optical spectra of both galaxies are characterized by
absorption lines and do not show signs of (Seyfert) activity. This makes
RXJ1242-11 the third candidate for giant-amplitude variability in an otherwise
non-active galaxy, the first two being NGC 4552 (in the UV; Renzini et al.
1995) and NGC 5905 (in X-rays; Bade et al. 1996, Komossa & Bade 1999). Several
mechanisms to explain this unexpected and peculiar behavior are investigated.
The most likely one seems to be an accretion event onto an otherwise dormant
supermassive black hole (SMBH), e.g., by a tidal disruption event.

are piles of rubble bound together by gravity. We present results from a
project to map the parameter space of collisions between km-sized spherical
rubble piles. The results will assist in parameterization of collision outcomes
for Solar System formation models and give insight into fragmentation scaling
laws. We use a direct numerical method to evolve the positions and velocities
of the rubble pile particles under the constraints of gravity and physical
collisions. We test the dependence of the collision outcomes on impact
parameter and speed, impactor spin, mass ratio, and coefficient of restitution.
Speeds are kept low (< 10 m/s, appropriate for dynamically cool systems such as
the primordial disk during early planet formation) so that the maximum strain
on the component material does not exceed the crushing strength. We compare our
results with analytic estimates and hydrocode simulations. Off-axis collisions
can result in fast-spinning elongated remnants or contact binaries while fast
collisions result in smaller fragments overall. Clumping of debris escaping
from the remnant can occur, leading to the formation of smaller rubble piles.
In the cases we tested, less than 2% of the system mass ends up orbiting the
remnant. Initial spin can reduce or enhance collision outcomes, depending on
the relative orientation of the spin and orbital angular momenta. We derive a
relationship between impact speed and angle for critical dispersal of mass in
the system. We find that our rubble piles are relatively easy to disperse, even
at low impact speed, suggesting that greater dissipation is required if rubble
piles are the true progenitors of protoplanets.

inflationary and in which the scalar field's energy-density remains a fixed

  Detailed stellar evolution calculations with a main sequence mass of 7 M_o
have been performed to test the influence of the metallicity Z on the structure
of the progenitor. A change of Z influences the central helium burning and,
consequently, the size of the C/O core which becomes a C/O white dwarf and its
C/O ratio. Subsequently, the white dwarf may grow to the Chandrasekhar mass and
explode as a Type Ia supernovae. Consequently, the C/O structure of the
exploding white dwarf depends on Z. Since C and O are the fuel for the
thermonuclear explosion, Z indirectly changes the energetics of the explosion.
  In our example, changing Z from Pop I to Pop II causes a change in the zero
point of the maximum brightness/decline relation by about $0.1^m$ and a change
in the rise time by about 1 day. Combined with previous studies, We provide a
relation between a change of the rise time in SNeIa and the off-set in the
brightness/decline relation. We find that dM = dt where dM is the offset in the
relation and dt is the change of the rise time in days.
  This relation provides a way to detect and test for evolutionary effects, and
to estimate the possible consequences for the determination of the cosmological
constant. However, due to uncertainties in the time evolution of the properties

have caused dust balls to become molten in a matter of seconds, cooling more

it was the major absorber of x-rays between 7 keV and 30 keV. In this scenario,
chondrules formed at the same time across the side of the nebula toward the GRB
source. At least 27 Earth masses (M$\oplus$) could have been produced in the
nebula with well mixed gas and dust of solar composition, increasing to 100
M$\oplus$ with only moderate depletion of nebular gases. The chondrules
combined to form meteorites and possibly the terrestrial planets, the cores of
the giant planets and chondrules in comets. Assuming GRBs are linked to massive
stars like supernovae, the probability of a GRB within 100 pc which could form
chondrules is about 10$^{-3}$ and the same small probability may apply to other
planetary systems being akin to our solar system. A GRB in a nearby galaxy will
reveal protoplanetary disks by delayed transient infrared emission from the

Rev. B{\bf 43}, 11539 (1991)]. Direct generation of the moving dislocations
turns out to be virtually impossible; however, they can be generated initially
in the lattice subject to an auxiliary spatial modulation of the on-site
potential strength. Gradually relaxing the modulation, we are able to get the
stable moving dislocations in the uniform FK lattice with the periodic boundary
conditions, provided that the driving frequency is close to the gap frequency
of the linear excitations in the uniform lattice. The excitations have a large
and noninteger index of commensurability with the lattice (suggesting that its
actual value is irrational). The simulations reveal two different types of the
moving dislocations: broad ones, that extend, roughly, to half the full length
of the periodic lattice (in that sense, they cannot be called solitons), and
localized soliton-like dislocations, that can be found in an excited state,
demonstrating strong persistent internal vibrations. The minimum (threshold)
amplitude of the driving force necessary to support the traveling excitation is
found as a function of the friction coefficient. Its extrapolation suggests
that the threshold does not vanish at the zero friction, which may be explained
by radiation losses. The moving dislocation can be observed experimentally in
an array of coupled small Josephson junctions in the form of an {\it inverse
Josephson effect}, i.e., a dc-voltage response to the uniformly applied ac bias

Interactions between orthogonal chains, corresponding to orthogonal faces of
the square Fermi surface, are neglected. The correlation functions become sums
of Luttinger-type correlation functions due to the bosonic model. However, the
correlation function exponents differ in form from those of the Luttinger
model. As a consequence, the simple scaling relations found to exist between

Einstein and Hopf to treat the interaction of the zero-point field with such

vierbein bundles each associated with a distinct metric. The basic
gravitational action relates to one bundle while matter propagates relative to
the other in a conventional way. The variability of the speed of light is
represented by the variability of the matter light-cone relative to the
gravitational light-cone. The two bundles are related locally by an element M,
of SL(4,R). The dynamics of the field M is that of a SL(4,R)-sigma model gauged
with respect to local (orthochronous) Lorentz transformations on each of the
bundles. Only the ``massless'' version of the model with a single new coupling,
F, that has the same dimensions as Newton's constant $G_N$, is considered in
this paper. When F vanishes the theory reduces to standard General Relativity.
  We verify that the modified Bianchi identities of the model are consistent
with the standard conservation law for the matter energy-momentum tensor in its
own background metric.
  The implications of the model for some simple applications are examined, the

general relativistic irrotational binary neutron star systems. It is a good
approximation to assume that (1) the binary star system is irrotational, i.e.
the vorticity of the flow field inside component stars vanishes everywhere
(irrotational flow), and (2) the binary star system is in quasi-equilibrium,
for an inspiraling binary neutron star system just before the coalescence as a
result of gravitational wave emission. We can introduce the velocity potential
for such an irrotational flow field, which satisfies an elliptic partial
differential equation (PDE) with a Neumann type boundary condition at the
stellar surface. For a treatment of general relativistic gravity, we use the
Wilson--Mathews formulation, which assumes conformal flatness for spatial
components of metric. In this formulation, the basic equations are expressed by
a system of elliptic PDEs. We have developed a method to solve these PDEs with
appropriate boundary conditions. The method is based on the established
prescription for computing equilibrium states of rapidly rotating axisymmetric
neutron stars or Newtonian binary systems. We have checked the reliability of
our new code by comparing our results with those of other computations
available. We have also performed several convergence tests. By using this
code, we have obtained quasi-equilibrium sequences of irrotational binary star
systems with strong gravity as models for final states of real evolution of
binary neutron star systems just before coalescence. Analysis of our
quasi-equilibrium sequences of binary star systems shows that the systems may
not suffer from dynamical instability of the orbital motion and that the
maximum density does not increase as the binary separation decreases.

natural to assume that in the low-energy regime the underlying dynamics in
baryons is due to Goldstone boson exchange (GBE) between constituent quarks.
Using as a prototype of the microscopical quark-gluon degrees of freedom the
instanton-induced 't Hooft interaction I show why the GBE is so important. When
the 't Hooft interaction is iterated in the qq t-channel it inevitably leads to
a pole which corresponds to GBE. This is a typical antiscreening behavior: the
interaction is represented by a bare vertex at large momenta, but it blows up
at small momenta in the channel with GBE quantum numbers, explaining thus a
distinguished role of the latter interaction in the low-energy regime. I show
how the explicitly flavour-dependent short-range part of the GBE interaction
between quarks, perhaps in combination with the vector-meson exchange
interaction, solves a key problem of baryon spectroscopy and present spectra

through a locus of marginal stability: at the transition point the BPS particle
becomes degenerate with a supersymmetric two particle state, and after the
transition the lowest energy state carrying the same charges is a
non-supersymmetric two particle state. In the IIA theory, wrapping the cycles

considerable charge-splitting of the pion coupling constant. We investigate the
consequences of this for the charge-independence breaking (CIB) of the $^1S_0$
scattering length, $\Delta a_{CIB}$. We find that $\Delta a_{CIB}$ depends
sensitively on the difference between $g_{\pi^\pm}$ and the neutral $\pi NN$
coupling constant, $g_{\pi^0}$. Moreover, if $g^2_{\pi^\pm}$ is only about 3%
larger than $g^2_{\pi^0}$, then the established theoretical explanation of
$\Delta a_{CIB}$ (in terms of pion mass splitting) is completely wiped out.

reached a local minimum at an optimal current corresponding to minimum mirror
roughness. A distinct increase in roughness was found for mirror configurations
with even versus odd number of lines. These observations confirm theoretical

The
high density regions initially collapse into cylindrical structures, which
subsequently destabilize and break up into spherical aggregates. This paper
presents a theoretical description of the process, from the structure of the
collapsing cylinder to the spacing of the final aggregates. We show that
cylindrical collapse involves a delicate balance in which bacterial attraction
and diffusion nearly cancel, leading to corrections to the collapse laws
expected from dimensional analysis. The instability of a collapsing cylinder is
composed of two distinct stages: Initially, slow modulations to the cylinder
develop, which correspond to a variation of the collapse time along the
cylinder axis. Ultimately, one point on the cylinder pinches off. At this final
stage of the instability, a front propagates from the pinch into the remainder
of the cylinder. The spacing of the resulting spherical aggregates is
determined by the front propagation.

holistic paradigm, by introducing a complex basic unit system mathematical
concept in which the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of reality
commingle in a unit, and by presenting a new principle, the principle of
synergy, we have then a new framework in which the opposites can become
complementary. The purpose of the Bus is to establish a complex mathematical
unit concept based on Euler relation from which reality, physical reality can
be treated and interpreted, starting from more basic principles or just from a
unified theoretical point of view. The exact simple pendulum formula and the
well-known Schodinger Wave Equation will be the starting point. This approach
will mean a departure from the normal evolution of physical western science had
taken, but its main advantage will not only be a synthesis of that science but
also a unification that will permit validate those great achievements of
figures like Galileo, Newton, Ampere, Faraday, Maxwell, Einstein and Schodinger
by embedding those achievements in a unified mathematical-theoretical
framework. The origin of this work goes back to 1991(copyright in Dec 1991 as

noise. When using qubits, a measure of quality of a code is the maximum number
of errors that it is able to correct. We show that a suitable notion of
``number of errors'' e makes sense for any system in the presence of arbitrary
environmental interactions. In fact, the notion is directly related to the
lowest order in time with which uncorrectable errors are introduced, and this
in turn is derived from a grading of the algebra generated by the interaction
operators. As a result, e-error-correcting codes are effective at protecting
quantum information without requiring the usual assumptions of independence and
lack of correlation. We prove the existence of large codes for both quantum and
classical information. By viewing error-correcting codes as subsystems, we
relate codes to irreducible representations of certain operator algebras and
show that noiseless subsystems are infinite-distance error-correcting codes. An
explicit example involving collective interactions is discussed.

that chaotic dynamics exists for classic dynamics, when the intensity of the
beam is periodically modulated. The two dimensional distributions of atoms in
(x,y) plane are simulated. We show that the atoms will accumulate on several
annular regions when the system enters a regime of global chaos. Our simulation
shows that, when the atomic flux is very small, a similar distribution will be
obtained if we detect the atomic distribution once each the modualtion period
and integrate the signals.
  For quantum dynamics, quantum collapses and revivals appear . For
periodically modulated optical potential, the variance of atomic position will
be supressed compared to the no modulation case. The atomic angular momentum
will influnce the evolution of wave function in two dimensional quantum system
of hollow fiber.
