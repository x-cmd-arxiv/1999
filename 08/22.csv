  press",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Because of their low gravitational energies dwarf galaxies are greatly
exposed to energetical influences by the interstellar medium, like e.g. stellar
radiation, winds or explosions, or by their environment. While the metallicity
depletion in dwarf galaxies can be explained in general by supernova-driven
galactic winds, the reason for their low N/O ratios at low O abundance is not
yet completely understood. Stellar yields enrich the different gas phases with
elements that are characteristic for their stellar progenitors. Gas-phase
transitions are necessary for a mixing of elements, but depend sensitively on
the thermal and dynamical state of the interstellar medium. Models of chemical
evolution start usually with a high N/O ratio at low O abundance according to a
metal enrichment by ancient stellar populations with traditional yields, but
can only reproduce the N/O-O peculiarity by the stepwise element release and
mostly by the application of multiple starbursts in order to account also for a
selective element reduction by galactic winds. Chemodynamical models of dwarf
galaxies, however, demonstrate that strong evaporation of clouds by the hot
supernova gas leads to an almost perfect mixing of the interstellar gas and a
large-scale homogenization of abundance ratios. In addition, even with
star-formation self-regulation these models can successfully account for the
observed N/O-O values in a self-consistent way. Although new stellar yields
have been taken into account which provide mainly secondary N production from
massive stars, a significant discrepancy remains between the chemodynamical
dwarf galaxy models and closed-box models that take the chemodynamical
treatment into account. In this paper we therefore discuss to what amount gas
infall is responsible to affect the N/O ratio.

correlation between radio power and degree of clustering. However, it has been
demonstrated that extended X-ray luminosity and galaxy clustering do exhibit a
positive correlation. This study investigates a complete sample of 25 nearby (z
less than 0.06) radio galaxies which are not cataloged members of Abell
clusters. The environment of these radio galaxies is studied in both the X-ray
and the optical by means of the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), ROSAT pointed
observations, and the Palomar optical Digitized Sky Survey (DSS). X-ray
luminosities and extents are determined from the RASS, and the DSS is used to
quantify the degree of clustering via the spatial two-point correlation
coefficient, Bgg. Of the 25 sources, 20 are greater than sigma detections in
the X-ray and 11 possessed Bgg's significantly in excess of that expected for
an isolated galaxy. Adding the criterion that the X-ray emission be resolved,
10 of the radio galaxies do appear to reside in poor clusters with extended
X-ray emission suggestive of the presence of an intracluster medium. Eight of
these galaxies also possess high spatial correlation coefficients. Taken
together, these data suggest that the radio galaxies reside in a low richness
extension of the Abell clusters. The unresolved X-ray emission from the other
galaxies is most likely associated with AGN phenomena. Furthermore, although
the sample size is small, it appears that the environments of FR I and FR II
sources differ. FR I's tend to be more frequently associated with extended
X-ray emission (10 of 18), whereas FR II's are typically point sources or
non-detections in the X-ray (none of the 7 sources exhibit extended X-ray
emission).

measurements. The seemingly complicated dependence of $T_c$ on the Hund's
