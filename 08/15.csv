spectrum of density perturbations is close to one, though not precisely equal
to one, |n-1| \sim O(0.1), implying that the spectrum of density perturbations
is nearly, but not exactly, scale invariant. Some models allow n to be
significantly less than one (n \sim 0.7); a spectral index significantly
greater than one is more difficult to achieve. We show that n \approx 1 is a
consequence of the slow-roll conditions for inflation and ``naturalness,'' and
thus is a generic prediction of inflation. We discuss what is required to
deviate significantly from scale invariance, and then show, by explicit
construction, the existence of smooth potentials that satisfy all the
conditions for successful inflation and give $n$ as large as 2.

characteristics of massive circumstellar disks in two dimensions ($r$, $\phi$)
using two complimentary hydrodynamic codes: a `Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic'
(SPH) code and a `Piecewise Parabolic Method' (PPM) code. I also study the
detection limits available to radial velocity searches for low mass companions
to main sequence stars. The thesis is organized as a series of published or
submitted papers, connected by introductory and concluding material and is
archived `for posterity'. I recommend that readers of this abstract obtain the
published versions of each of these papers. I first outline the progress which
has been made in the modeling of the structure and origins of the solar system,
then in chapter 2 (ApJ 502,p342) I proceed with numerical simulations of
circumstellar disks using both hydrodynamic codes assuming a `locally
isothermal' equation of state. In chapter 4 (ApJ submitted) I relax the locally
isothermal evolution assumption and instead include simple heating and cooling
prescriptions for the system. In chapter 6 (ApJ 500,p940) I examine the limits
which may be placed upon the detection of planets, brown dwarfs and low mass
stellar companions using radial velocity measurements. In chapter 7, I outline
several problems which may be profitably addressed by building on this work.

the central qualitative feature of the landscape. I also review recent progress
in our understanding of cold, dense quark matter, as may occur in the cores of
neutron stars. In this regime, quarks form Cooper pairs. The formation of such
superconducting phases requires only weak attractive interactions, as provided
by one-gluon exchange at asymptotically high density; these phases may
nevertheless break chiral symmetry (by locking flavor symmetries to color
symmetry) and may have excitations which are indistinguishable from those in a
confined phase. Mapping this part of the phase diagram will require a better
understanding of how the presence of color superconductivity and color-flavor
locking affects neutron star phenomenology.

complex projective spaces CP_q^{N-1} which are quantum homogeneous spaces for
the quantum group SU_q(N). Hereby, one more well-studied example of covariant
first order differential calculus on a quantum homogeneous space is given.
Since the complex projective spaces are subalgebras of the quantum spheres
S_q^{2N-1} introduced by Vaksman and Soibelman, we get also an example of the
relations between covariant differential calculus on two closely related
quantum spaces.
  Two approaches are combined in obtaining covariant first order differential
calculi on CP_q^{N-1}: 1. restriction of covariant first order differential
calculi from S_q^{2N-1}; 2. classification of calculi under appropriate
constraints, using methods from representation theory.
  The main result is that under three reasonable settings of dimension
constraints, covariant first order differential calculi on CP_q^{N-1} exist and
are (for N >= 6) uniquely determined. This is a clear difference as compared to
the case of the quantum spheres where several parametrical series of calculi
exist. For two of the constraint settings, the covariant first order calculi on
CP_q^{N-1} are also obtained by restriction from calculi on S_q^{2N-1} as well
as from calculi on the quantum group SU_q(N).
