Observations have, however, shown that the jets can be mildly to weakly

neutral, plasma and magnetic pressures we calculate the characteristic
time-scale for ambipolar diffusion. Our results show that a significant
fraction of HH jets will have ambipolar diffusion time-scales equivalent to, or
less than the dynamical time-scales. This implies that MHD equilibria
established at the base of a HH jet may not be maintained as the jet propagates
far from its source. For typical jet parameters one finds that the length scale
where ambipolar diffusion should become significant corresponds to the typical
size of large (parsec) scale jets. We discuss the significance of these results
for the issue of magnetic fields in parsec-scale jets.

in the Halo of our Galaxy. We are motivated by microlensing evidence for
massive compact halo objects (Machos) in the Galactic Halo, but our work
constrains white dwarfs in the Halo regardless of what the Machos are. We focus
on the composition of the material that would be ejected as the white dwarfs
are formed; abundance patterns in the ejecta strongly constrain white dwarf
production scenarios. Using both analytical and numerical chemical evolution
models, we confirm that very strong constraints come from Galactic Pop II and
extragalactic carbon abundances. We also point out that depending on the
stellar model, significant nitrogen is produced rather than carbon. The
combined constraints from C and N give $\Omega_{WD} h < 2 \times 10^{-4}$ from
comparison with the low C and N abundances in the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We note,
however, that these results are subject to uncertainties regarding the
nucleosynthesis of low-metallicity stars. We thus investigate additional
constraints from D and $^4$He, finding that these light elements can be kept
within observational limits only for $\Omega_{WD} \la 0.003$ and for a white
dwarf progenitor initial mass function sharply peaked at low mass (2$M_\odot$).
Finally, we consider a Galactic wind, which is required to remove the ejecta
accompanying white dwarf production from the galaxy. We show that such a wind
can be driven by Type Ia supernovae arising from the white dwarfs themselves,
but these supernovae also lead to unacceptably large abundances of iron. We
conclude that abundance constraints exclude white dwarfs as Machos. (abridged)

distribution of the magnification of distant sources due to weak gravitational
lensing from non-linear scales. We use a realistic description of the

simulations. Then, we can directly express the p.d.f. $P(\mu)$ of the
magnification in terms of the p.d.f. of the density contrast realized on
non-linear scales (typical of galaxies) where the local slope of the initial
linear power-spectrum is $n=-2$. We recover the behaviour seen by numerical
simulations: $P(\mu)$ peaks at a value slightly smaller than the mean $<\mu>=1$
and it shows an extended large $\mu$ tail (as described in another article our
predictions also show a good quantitative agreement with results from N-body
simulations for a finite smoothing angle). Then, we study the effects of weak
lensing on the derivation of the cosmological parameters from SNeIa. We show
that the inaccuracy introduced by weak lensing is not negligible: $\Delta
\Omega_m \ga 0.3$ for two observations at $z_s=0.5$ and $z_s=1$. However,
observations can unambiguously discriminate between $\Omega_m=0.3$ and
$\Omega_m=1$. Moreover, in the case of a low-density universe one can clearly
distinguish an open model from a flat cosmology (besides, the error decreases
as the number of observed SNeIa increases). Since distant sources are more
likely to be ``demagnified'' the most probable value of the observed density
parameter $\Omega_m$ is slightly smaller than its actual value. On the other
hand, one may obtain some valuable information on the properties of the
underlying non-linear density field from the measure of weak lensing
distortions.

Management Protocol (AVNMP), for predictive network management. It explains how
the AVNMP facilitates the management of an active network by allowing future
predicted state information within an active network to be available to network
management algorithms. This is accomplished by coupling ideas from optimistic
discrete event simulation with active networking. The optimistic discrete event
simulation method used is a form of self-adjusting Time Warp. It is
self-adjusting because the system adjusts for predictions which are inaccurate
beyond a given tolerance. The concept of a streptichron and autoanaplasis are
introduced as mechanisms which take advantage of the enhanced flexibility and
intelligence of active packets. Finally, it is demonstrated that the AVNMP is a
feasible concept.

turbulence can be addressed in a deterministic setting instead of introducing
random realizations of the fluid. Weak limits of oscillating sequences of
solutions are considered and along the same line the Wigner transform replaces
the Kolmogorov definition of the spectra of turbulence. One of the main issue
is to show that, at least in some cases, this weak limit is the solution of an
equation with an extra diffusion (the name turbulent diffusion appears
naturally). In particular for a weak limit of solutions of the incompressible
Euler equation (which is time reversible) such process would lead to the
appearance of irreversibility. In the absence of proofs, following a program
initiated by P. Lax, the diffusive property of the limit is analyzed, with the
tools of Lax and Levermore or Jin Levermore and Mc Laughlin, on the zero
dispersion limit of the Korteweg-deVries equation and of the Non Linear
Schrodinger equation. The three authors are extremely happy to have the
opportunity to publish this contribution in a volume dedicated to Walter
Strauss as a mark of friendship and admiration for his achievement. They hope
that this paper concerned with non linear fluid mechanics, non linear
instabilities and inverse scattering, will find its place in the different
domains that have interested Walter.

  Polynomial Equations",,,,"MSRI 1999-017","math.PR",,"  Theorem 1 is a formula expressing the mean number of real roots of a random
multihomogeneous system of polynomial equations as a multiple of the mean
absolute value of the determinant of a random matrix. Theorem 2 derives closed
form expressions for the mean in special cases that include earlier results of
Shub and Smale (for the general homogeneous system) and Rojas (for ``unmixed''
multihomogeneous systems). Theorem 3 gives upper and lower bounds for the mean
number of roots, where the lower bound is the square root of the generic number
of complex roots, as determined by Bernstein's theorem. These bounds are
derived by induction from recursive inequalities given in Theorem 4.

  Lie-algebraic setting",,,,"MSRI 1999-015","math.NA",,"  Discretization methods for ordinary differential equations based on the use
of matrix exponentials have been known for decades. This set of ideas has come
off age and acquired greater urgency recently, within the context of geometric
integration and discretization methods on manifolds based on the use of
Lie-group actions.
  In the present paper we study the approximation of the matrix exponential in
a particular context: given a Lie group $G$ and its Lie algebra $g$, we seek
approximants $F(tB)$ of $\exp(tB)$ such that $F(tB)\in G$ if $B\in g$. Having
fixed a basis of the Lie algebra, we write $F(tB)$ as a composition of
exponentials of the basis elements pre-multiplied by suitable scalar functions.

The method extends to families of canonically polarized manifolds, but the
modular interpretation requires the existence of relative minimal models.

calculations are compared with experimental data to perform detailed discussion
about the importance of rescattering among hadrons. We find good agreement with
the experimental data without any change of model parameters with the cascade
model. It is found that rescattering is of importance both for the explanation
of high transverse momentum tail and for the multiplicity of produced
particles.
