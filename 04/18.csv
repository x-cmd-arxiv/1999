  January 23-30, 1999",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Merger events of close double neutron stars (DNS) lie at the basis of a
number of current issues in relativistic astrophysics, such as the indirect and
possible direct detection of gravitational waves, the production of gamma-ray
bursts at cosmological distances, and the origin of r-process elements in the
universe. In assessing the importance or relevance of DNS coalescence to these
issues, knowledge of the rate of coalescence in our Galaxy is required. In this
paper, I review the current estimates of the DNS merger rate (theoretical and
empirical) and discuss new ways to obtain limits on this rate using all
information available at present.

the updated log of Evans' visual search to our SN search database. In this way,
we have accumulated the largest SN statistics ever assembled for this purpose.
The new SN rates are corrected on an empirical basis for the bias in the inner
regions of galaxies and that in inclined spirals. We also tested an alternative
approach based on the simple model proposed by Hatano et al. (1998) for the SN
and dust distribution in spirals. It turns out that, although the two
approaches give similar average rates, the Hatano et al. model appears to
overcorrect the SN rate of distant galaxies. We used these updated statistics
to probe the SN rates with different tracers of the star formation activity in
galaxies, namely integrated colors, infrared luminosities and nuclear
activities. We found a clear relation between the core-collapse SN rate and the
integrated galaxy color, which appears consistent with the prediction of galaxy
evolutionary models. We also compared SN rates in galaxies with different L_FIR
with unfavorable outcome, and we argue that L_FIR is not a universal
measurement of SFR. Finally, we confirm that the SN rate is not enhanced in AGN
host galaxies which indicates that the nuclear engine does not significantly
stimulate the extranuclear SF.

The clouds are heated and ionized by the photoionizing flux from the active

nicely fits the bump in the soft X-ray domain, while bremsstrahlung radiation
from the gaseous clouds contribute to the fit of the continuum SED. Debris of
high density fragmented clouds are necessary to explain the absorption oxygen
throats observed at 0.87 keV and 0.74 keV. The debris are heated by shocks of
about 200-300 km/s. Low velocity (100 km/s)-density (100 cm-3) clouds
contribute to the line and continuum spectra, as well as high velocity (1000
km/s)-density (8000 cm-3) clouds which are revealed by the FWHM of the line
profiles. The SED in the IR is explained by reradiation of dust, however, the
dust-to-gas ratio is not particularly high. Radio emission is well fitted by
synchrotron radiation created at the shock front by Fermi mechanism.

spectrum is fit by thermal plasma (kT=0.80+-0.17 keV) absorbed by only the
Galactic foreground column density. We evaluate the relationship of the
X-ray/H-alpha ridge to the M82 superwind. The main properties of the X-ray
emission can all be explained as being due to shock-heating driven as the
superwind encounters a massive ionized cloud in the halo of M82. This encounter
drives a slow shock into the cloud, which contributes to the excitation of the
observed H-alpha emission. At the same time, a fast bow-shock develops in the
superwind just upstream of the cloud, and this produces the observed X-ray
emission. This interpretation would imply that the superwind has an outflow
speed of roughly 800 km/s, consistent with indirect estimates based on its
general X-ray properties and the kinematics of the inner kpc-scale region of
H-alpha filaments. The gas in the M82 ridge is roughly two orders-of-magnitude
hotter than the minimum ""escape temperature"" at this radius, so this gas will
not be retained by M82.

astronomical research is surprisingly insensitive to the institutional source
of one's PhD. With few exception, 55-75% of graduates, regardless of PhD
source, remain active in the astronomical research community. While it remains
true that graduates of so-called ``prestigious'' programs preferentially
populate the same, it is also clear that an abundance of opportunities exist at
smaller ``non-prestigious'' institutions, liberal arts colleges, government,

and/or teaching duties, but, on the other hand, do not entirely preclude a role
in the research community. A Kepler-Meier survival analysis of two disparate
institutes demonstrates that ``success'' is a dynamical entity, and that blind
consideration of a 20-year baseline sample can mask important recent trends.
Within ten years of PhD receipt, an equilibrium is reached in which 45% of the
graduates are in identifiably permanent positions, 20% remain in soft-money
positions, and 35% have left research entirely. Graduates of American
universities are 2-3 times more likely to find permanent employment in the USA
