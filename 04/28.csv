  Astronomy and Astrophysics, accepted",,,"MPA-1161, RIKEN-AF-NP-307","astro-ph",,"  Radioactive isotopes such as 44Ti offer probably the most direct probe into
nucleosynthesis environments in the interior of exploding stars, when the
associated gamma-ray activities in the explosion remnant are detected and
translated back to the isotopic abundances at the time of the explosion. In
this paper, we assert that the procedure may not necessarily be
straightforward, at least in the case of 44Ti, an orbital-electron capture
decay isotope. Using the analytic model of McKee and Truelove (1995) for young
supernova remnants, and assuming the existence of overdense 56Fe-dominated
clumps that contain also 44Ti, we show that a high degree of ionization may be
caused by the reverse shock so that the electron-capture rate of 44Ti could be
significantly reduced from its laboratory value. When applied to Cas A, this
increases under certain conditions the current 44Ti-activity by a factor 1.5 -
2.5, which yields a better compatibility between the COMPTEL observation of the
1.16 MeV line activity associated with the 44Ti decay and the SN model
predictions of the initial 44Ti abundance. This possibility is, however,
subject to various uncertainties, and in particular to the unknown properties
and radial distribution of the the clumps in the ejecta.

galaxy clusters A2199 and A496, which have the most accurate ASCA spectral data
for all hot clusters. These clusters are relaxed and can provide reliable X-ray
mass measurements under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium. The cluster
average temperatures corrected for the presence of cooling flows are 4.8+-0.2
keV and 4.7+-0.2 keV (90% errors), respectively. Outside the central cooling
flow regions, the radial temperature profiles are similar to those of the
majority of nearby relaxed clusters. They are accurately described by
polytropic models with gamma=1.17+-0.07 for A2199 and gamma=1.24+-0.09 for
A496. We use these polytropic models to derive accurate total mass profiles.
Within r=0.5/h Mpc, which corresponds to a radius of overdensity 1000, the
total mass values are 1.45+-0.15 10^14 /h Msun and 1.55+-0.15 10^14 /h Msun.
These values are 10% lower than those obtained assuming constant temperature.
The values inside a gas core radius (0.07-0.13/h Mpc) are a factor of >1.5
higher than the isothermal values. The gas mass fraction increases with radius
(by a factor of 3 between the X-ray core radius and r_1000) and at r_1000
reaches values of 0.057+-0.005 and 0.056+-0.006 h^-3/2 for the two clusters,
respectively. Our mass profiles within r_1000 are remarkably well approximated
by the NFW ""universal"" profile. Since A2199 and A496 are typical relaxed
clusters, the above findings should be relevant for most such systems. In
particular, the similarity of the temperature profiles in nearby clusters
appears to reflect the underlying ""universal"" dark matter profile. The upward
revision of mass at small radii will resolve most of the discrepancy between
the X-ray and strong lensing mass estimates. (Abridged)

conservation, fully nonlinear fluid advection, inelastic macroscopic
interactions, threshold star formation, and momentum forcing by winds from
young star clusters on the surrounding gas. Expanding shells of swept-up gas
evolve through the action of fluid advection to form a ``turbulent'' network of
interacting shell fragments whose overall appearance is a web of filaments (in
two dimensions). A new star cluster is formed whenever the column density
through a filament exceeds a critical threshold based on the gravitational
instability criterion for an expanding shell, which then generates a new
expanding shell after some time delay. A filament- finding algorithm is
developed to locate the potential sites of new star formation. The major result
is the dominance of multiple interactions between advectively-distorted shells
in controlling the gas and star morphology, gas velocity distribution and mass
spectrum of high mass density peaks, and the global star formation history. The

  The second parameter correlations of M(max) of blue SNe Ia with decay rate,
color at maximum, and Hubble type are re-investigated. The dependence of
<M(max)> on decay rate is non-linear, showing a minimum for decay rates between
1.0< Delta m_15 <1.6. Magnitudes corrected for decay rate show no dependence on
Hubble type, but a dependence on color remains. Correcting both the fiducial

perturbations are purely decaying on superhorizon scales. On subhorizon scales
before recombination, magnetized density perturbations propagate as
magneto-sonic waves, leading to a small decrease in the spacing of acoustic
peaks. Fluctuations in the field direction induce scale-dependent vorticity,
and generate precession in the rotational vector. On small scales, magnetized

recombination, they decay slower than non-magnetized vortices. Magnetic

kinds of string solutions occur: $\Lambda$ strings, related to spin degrees of
freedom and $k-\Lambda$ strings, describing spinless bound states of electrons.
Whereas $\Lambda$ strings were thoroughly studied in the literature, less is
known about $k-\Lambda$ strings. We carry out a thorough analytical and
numerical analysis of $k-\Lambda$ strings. We further review two different
approaches to the thermodynamics of the Hubbard model, the Yang-Yang approach
and the quantum transfer matrix approach, respectively. The Yang-Yang approach
is based on strings, the quantum transfer matrix approach is not. We compare
the results of both methods and show that they agree. Finally, we obtain the
dispersion curves of all elementary excitations at zero magnetic field for the
less than half-filled band by considering the zero temperature limit of the
Yang-Yang approach.

excitation version of the CCM, implemented using the approximate coupled pair
(ACP) method, account for most of the correlation energies of the 2D Hubbard
model in the weak ($U/t \simeq 1$) and the intermediate $U/t$ regions ($U/t
\simeq 4$). The error is always less than 1% there. The ACP approximation gets
less accurate for large $U/t$ ($U/t \simeq 8$) and/or near half-filling.
Further incorporation of electron correlation effects is necessary in this

lowest unoccupied level and the highest occupied level due to the finite size
effect. Hence, the CCM may be favorably applied to ab-initio band calculations
on metals as well as semiconductors and insulators.

metallic armchair $(n,n)$ NTs develop a band-gap which initially scales
linearly with twisting angle and then reaches a constant value. This saturation

rules, and an exact residual Z_2 symmetry, that is lepton parity. As concerns
neutrino parameters, the Z_2 symmetry forbids contributions from R_p-violating

separation into the size of space S^1 in the adiabatic approximation. It is
natural to identify the size of space S^1 with the scale factor of the
Robertson-Walker-type metric. This replacement simplifies the construction of a
class of effective models to study the Casimir effects. To check the validity
of this replacement we construct a model for a scalar field coupling to the
two-dimensional gravity and calculate the Casimir effects by the effective
action for the variable scale factor. Our effective action consists of the
classical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the quantum correction
derived by the path-integral method. The quantum correction naturally contains
both the Casimir energy term and the back-reaction term of the dynamical
Casimir effect, the latter of which is expressed by the conformal anomaly. The
resultant effective action describes the dynamical vacuum pressure, i.e., the
dynamical Casimir force. We confirm that the force depends on the relative
velocity of the mirrors, and that it is always attractive and stronger than the
static Casimir force within the adiabatic approximation.

The random potential consists of delta functions of random strengths situated
on the sites of a regular two-dimensional lattice. We characterize the spectrum
in the lowest N Landau bands of this random Hamiltonian when the magnetic field
is sufficiently strong, depending on N. We show that the spectrum in these
bands is entirely pure point, that the energies coinciding with the Landau
levels are infinitely degenerate and that the eigenfunctions corresponding to
energies in the remainder of the spectrum are localized with a uniformly
bounded localization length. By relating the Hamiltonian to a lattice operator
we are able to use the Aizenman-Molchanov method to prove localization.

a sphere to X, becomes homotopy equivalent to the space of all continuous maps,
  lim_{->} Hol_{x_0}(P^1,X) = Omega^2 X.
  This limit will be viewed as a kind of stabilization of Hol_{x_0}(P^1,X). We
conjecture that this stability holds if and only if an evaluation map E:
lim_{->} Hol_{x_0}(P^1,X) -> X is a quasifibration. In this paper we will prove
that in the presence of this quasifibration condition, then the stability
property holds if and only if the Morse theoretic flow category (defined in
[4]) of the symplectic action functional on the Z-cover of the loop space, L~X,
defined by the symplectic form, has a classifying space that realizes the
homotopy type of L~X. We conjecture that in the presence of this quasifibration
condition, this Morse theoretic condition always holds. We will prove this in
the case of X a homogeneous space, thereby giving an alternate proof of the
stability theorem for holomorphic spheres for a projective homogeneous variety

When arbitrary intermediate measurements are allowed, this intuition breaks
down. Nonetheless, we show a 2^{Omega(n)} lower bound for such QFA for L_n,
thus also improving the previous bound. The improved bound is obtained by
simple entropy arguments based on Holevo's theorem. This method also allows us
to obtain an asymptotically optimal (1-H(p))n bound for the dense quantum codes
