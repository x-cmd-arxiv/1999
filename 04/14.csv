observational cosmology because distant galaxies are seen as they were in the
distant past and hence probe early galaxy formation, due to the cosmologically
significant light travel time. We have sought to identify distant galaxies in
very deep spectroscopy by combining a new spectrum extraction technique with
photometric and spectroscopic analysis techniques. Here we report the
identification of a galaxy of redshift z = 6.68, which is the most distant
object ever identified. The spectrum of the galaxy is characterized by an
abrupt discontinuity at wavelength $\lambda \approx 9300$ \AA, which we
interpret as the \lya decrement (produced by intervening Hydrogen absorption),
and by an emission line at wavelength $\lambda \approx 9334$, which we
interpret as \lya. The galaxy is relatively bright, and the ultraviolet
luminosity density contributed by the galaxy alone is almost ten times the
value measured at $z \approx 3$.

analysed, cosmological constraints are only comparable to those from optical

lower, which leads to both relatively fewer lenses in the survey and a weaker
dependence on the cosmological parameters. Although more approximations have to
be made than is the case for optical surveys, the consistency of the results
with those from optical gravitational lens surveys and other cosmological tests
indicate that this is not a major source of uncertainty in the results.
However, joint constraints from a combination of radio and optical data are
much tighter. Thus, a similar analysis of the much larger Cosmic Lens All-Sky

show that in the case of screening by multivalent counterions the electrostatic

strongly correlated liquids (SCL) of counterions at the charged surface due to
strong lateral repulsion between them. When a membrane or a polyelectrolyte is
bent, SCL is compressed on one side and stretched on the other so that
thermodynamic properties of SCL contribute to the bending rigidity.
Thermodynamic properties of SCL are similar to those of Wigner crystal and are
anomalous in the sense that the pressure, compressibility and screening radius
of SCL are negative. This brings about substantial negative correction to the
bending rigidity. For the case of DNA this effect qualitatively agrees with

CP-even combination of anomalous couplings are estimated as -3 < Re(mu) < 2 for
Im(mu) = 0 = d, and sqrt{Im(mu)^2 + |d|^2} < 2.25 for Re(mu) = 0. There is an
improvement by roughly a factor of 2 at 1000 GeV. On the other hand, from the
CP-odd combination, we derive the possible complementary bounds as -3.6 <
Im(mu^* d) < 3.6 for Im(d) = 0, and -10 < Im(d) < 10 for Im(mu^* d) = 0, at a
c.m. energy of 500 GeV. The corresponding limit for 1000 GeV is almost an order
of magnitude better for Im(mu^* d), though somewhat worse for Im(d). Results
for the c.m. energies 500 GeV and 1000 GeV, if combined, would yield independen
limits on the two CP-violating parameters of -0.8 < Im(mu^* d) < 0.8 and -11 <

expressed in terms of the f's, of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing angles,

$e^+e^- B^+B^-, e^+e^- D_s^+D_s^-$ and $e^+e^- K^\pm \pi^\mp$; the last

unfortunately, that of $K^\pm \pi^\mp$; the channel $D_s^+ D_s^-$ could have
been missed in present experiments for a Higgs mass lower than $65 GeV$ because
of insufficient statistics. For higher masses this Higgs becomes undetectable
from such channels. This shows that too drastic conclusions should not be drawn

action agrees with the known Born-Infeld action in the case of a single brane

satisfies the nontrivial consistency condition suggested by Douglas that the
masses of off-diagonal fields are given by the geodesic distance between the
corresponding pair of D0-branes. This agreement arises from combinatorial
factors which depend upon the symmetrized trace ordering prescription found
earlier for higher moments of the matrix theory stress-energy tensor. We study
the effect of a weak background metric on two graviton interactions and find

are classified by pairs of Lie algebras $(A,G)$ of ADE type. For each model, we
consider the action of its (discrete) symmetry group on the boundary
conditions. We find that the invariant ones correspond to the nodes in the
product graph $A \otimes G$ that are fixed by some automorphism. We proceed to
determine the charges of the fields in the various Hilbert spaces, but, in a
general minimal model, many consistent solutions occur. In the unitary models
$(A,A)$, we show that there is a unique solution with the property that the
ground state in each sector of boundary conditions is invariant under the
symmetry group. In contrast, a solution with this property does not exist in
the unitary models of the series $(A,D)$ and $(A,E_6)$. A possible
interpretation of this fact is that a certain (large) number of invariant
boundary conditions have unphysical (negative) classical boundary Boltzmann
weights. We give a tentative characterization of the problematic boundary

generalization of electric-magnetic duality to the nonabelian theory. The
result implies that the gauge symmetry is doubled from SU(N) to $SU(N) \times
\widetilde{SU}(N)$, while the physical degrees of freedom remain the same, so
that the theory can be described in terms of either the usual Yang-Mills
potential $A_\mu(x)$ or its dual $\tilde{A}_\mu(x)$. Nonabelian `electric'
charges appear as sources of $A_\mu$ but as monopoles of $\tilde{A}_\mu$, while
their `magnetic' counterparts appear as monopoles of $A_\mu$ but sources of
$\tilde{A}_\mu$. Although these results have been derived only for classical
fields, it is shown for the quantum theory that the Dirac phase factors (or
Wilson loops) constructed out of $A_\mu$ and $\tilde{A}_\mu$ satisfy the 't
Hooft commutation relations, so that his results on confinement apply. Hence
one concludes, in particular, that since colour SU(3) is confined then dual
colour $\widetilde{SU}(3)$ is broken. Such predictions can lead to many very
interesting physical consequences which are explored in a companion paper.

valid for the momentum transfer $q^{2}=0$ demonstrates the effect of the strong
field, characterized by the momentum transfer $q^{2}=m_{e}^{2}$ ($m_{e}$ is the
electron mass). This allows for a test of the Standard Model in the presence of
strong fields in experiments with highly charged ions.

of two-level atoms, a two-mode quantized radiation field with a fixed total
number of photons, and a single laser-cooled ion in a two-dimensional harmonic
trap with a fixed total number of vibrational quanta. In the proposed
rearrangement, the standard spectroscopic and interferometric experiments are
inverted. Usually one measures an unknown frequency or phase shift using a
system prepared in a known quantum state. Our aim is just the inverse one,
i.e., to use a well-calibrated apparatus with known transformation parameters
to measure unknown quantum states.

superposition of two distinct atomic coherent states, which can be regarded as
atomic analogues of the states usually called Schrodinger cat states in quantum
optics. According to the relation of the constituents we define polar and
nonpolar cat states. The properties of these are investigated by the aid of the
spherical Wigner function. We show that nonpolar cat states generally exhibit
squeezing, the measure of which depends on the separation of the components of
the cat, and also on the number of the constituent atoms. By solving the master
equation for the polar cat state embedded in an external environment, we
determine the characteristic times of decoherence, dissipation and also the
characteristic time of a new parameter, the non-classicality of the state. This
latter one is introduced by the help of the Wigner function, which is used also
to visualize the process. The dependence of the characteristic times on the
number of atoms of the cat and on the temperature of the environment shows that
the decoherence of polar cat states is surprisingly slow.
