studied. In these models, the fox population is divided into three-species:
susceptible, infected or incubating, and infectious or rabid. They are based on
the fact that susceptible and incubating foxes are territorial while rabid
foxes have lost their sense of direction and move erratically. Two different
models are investigated: a one-dimensional coupled-map lattice model, and a
two-dimensional automata network model. Both models take into account the
short-range character of the infection process and the diffusive motion of
rabid foxes. Numerical simulations show how the spatial distribution of rabies,
and the speed of propagation of the epizootic front depend upon the carrying
capacity of the environment and diffusion of rabid foxes out of their
territory.

significant results even by chance. Moreover, in the case of one measure which
yields a detection, a bispectrum statistic, we find that if the non-Gaussian
feature is real, it may well be due to detector noise rather than a
non-Gaussian sky signal, since a signal-to-noise analysis localizes it to
angular scales smaller than the beam. We study its spatial origin in case it is
nonetheless due to a sky signal (eg, a cosmic string wake or flat-spectrum
foreground contaminant). It appears highly localized in the direction b=39.5,
l=257, since removing a mere 5 pixels inside a single COBE beam area centered
there makes the effect statistically insignificant. We also test Guassianity
with an eigenmode analysis which allows a sky map to be treated as a random
number generator. A battery of tests of this generator all yield results
consistent with Gaussianity.

For SETI, the use of various natural phenomena has previously been suggested to
achieve the desired synchronization. Here it is proposed that gamma-ray bursts

their large intrinsic luminosities, high occurrence rate, isotropic sky

demonstrate that the radial distribution of the relative [Fe/O] abundance

initial chemical composition of the star-forming gas. If the role of SNIa
explosions is negligible in the chemical enrichment, the ratio [Fe/O] remains
constant throughout the galactic disk with a steep gradient at the wave front.

of the $ROSAT$ All-Sky Survey. The two-point correlation function $\xi(r)$ of
the whole sample is well fitted (in an Einstein-de Sitter model) by the
power-law $\xi=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, with $r_0= 21.5^{+3.4}_{-4.4} h^{-1}$ Mpc
and $\gamma=2.11^{+0.53}_{-0.56}$ (95.4 per cent confidence level with one
fitting parameter). We use the RASS1 Bright Sample as a first application of a
theoretical model which aims at predicting the clustering properties of X-ray
clusters in flux-limited surveys for different cosmological scenarios. The
model uses the theoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperature
and X-ray cluster luminosity, and fully accounts for the redshift evolution of
the underlying dark matter clustering and cluster bias factor. The comparison
between observational results and theoretical predictions shows that the
Einstein-de Sitter models display too low a correlation length, while models
with a matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm 0m}=0.3$ (with or without a
cosmological constant) are successful in reproducing the observed clustering.
The dependence of the correlation length $r_0$ on the X-ray limiting flux and
luminosity of the sample is generally consistent with the predictions of all
our models. Quantitative agreement is however only reached for $\Omega_{\rm 0m}
= 0.3$ models. The model presented here can be reliably applied to future
deeper X-ray cluster surveys: the study of their clustering properties will
provide a useful complementary tool to the traditional cluster abundance
analyses to constrain the cosmological parameters.

Dualized Standard Model (DSM) suggests a natural explanation for exactly 3
generations of fermions as the `dual colour' $\widetilde{SU}(3)$ symmetry
broken in a particular manner. The resulting scheme then offers on the one hand
a fermion mass hierarchy and a perturbative method for calculating the mass and
mixing parameters of the Standard Model fermions, and on the other testable
predictions for new phenomena ranging from rare meson decays to ultra-high
energy cosmic rays. Calculations to 1-loop order gives, at the cost of
adjusting only 3 real parameters, values for the following quantities all
(except one) in very good agreement with experiment: the quark CKM matrix
elements $|V_{rs}|$, the lepton CKM matrix elements $|U_{rs}|$, and the second
generation masses $m_c, m_s, m_\mu$. This means, in particular, that it gives
near maximal mixing $U_{\mu3}$ between $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$ as observed by
SuperKamiokande, Kamiokande and Soudan, while keeping small the corresponding
quark angles $V_{cb}, V_{ts}$. In addition, the scheme gives (i) rough
order-of-magnitude estimates for the masses of the lowest generation, (ii)
predictions for low energy FCNC effects such as $K_L \to e \mu$, (iii) a
possible explanation for the long-standing puzzle of air showers beyond the GZK
cut-off. All these together, however, still represent but a portion of the
possible physical consequences derivable from the DSM scheme the majority of
which are yet to be explored.

the process, we recover generalized spacetime superalgebras and extensions of
supersymmetry found earlier. The enlargement of ordinary superspace with new
parameters gives rise to extended superspace groups, on which manifestly
supersymmetric actions may be constructed for various types of p-branes,
including D-branes (given by Chevalley-Eilenberg cocycles) with their
Born-Infeld fields. This results in a field/extended superspace democracy for
superbranes: all brane fields appear as pull-backs from a suitable target
superspace. Our approach also clarifies some facts concerning the origin of the

response function for quasielastic electron scattering from nuclear matter. In
QMC the coupling constant between the scalar ($\sigma$) meson and the nucleon
is expected to decrease with increasing nuclear density, because of the
self-consistent modification of the structure of the nucleon. The reduction of
the coupling constant then leads to a smaller contribution from relativistic
RPA than in the Walecka model. However, since the electromagnetic form factors
of the in-medium nucleon are modified at the same time, the longitudinal
response function and the Coulomb sum are reduced by a total of about 20% in
comparison with the Hartree contribution. We find that the relativistic RPA and

temperature and freeze-out density in the frame of lattice gas model. The
calculation shows different temperature dependence of physical observables at
different freeze-out density. In this case, the critical temperature when the
phase transition takes place depends on the freeze-out density. However, a
unique critical excitation energy reveals regardless of freeze-out density when
the excitation energy is used as a variable insteading of temperature.
Moreover, the different behavior of other physical observables with temperature
due to different $\rho_f$ vanishes when excitation energy replaces temperature.
It indicates that the excitation energy can be seen as a more basic quantity to
control nuclear disassembly.

only a single, molecule-independent, empirical parameter. It requires CCSD
(coupled cluster with all single and double substitutions) calculations in
$spdf$ and $spdfg$ basis sets, while CCSD(T) [i.e. CCSD with a
quasiperturbative treatment of connected triple excitations] calculations are
only required in $spd$ and $spdf$ basis sets. On workstation computers and
using conventional coupled cluster algorithms, systems as large as benzene can
be treated, while larger systems are feasible using direct coupled cluster
methods. The more rigorous scheme, W2 (Weizmann-2) theory, contains no
empirical parameters at all and yields a mean absolute error of 0.23 kcal/mol,
which is lowered to 0.18 kcal/mol for molecules dominated by dynamical
correlation. It involves CCSD calculations in $spdfg$ and $spdfgh$ basis sets
and CCSD(T) calculations in $spdf$ and $spdfg$ basis sets. On workstation
computers, molecules with up to three heavy atoms can be treated using
conventional coupled cluster algorithms, while larger systems can still be
treated using a direct CCSD code. Both schemes include corrections for scalar
relativistic effects, which are found to be vital for accurate results on
second-row compounds.

these outcomes interferometrically using a double slit interferometer modified
by a system of optical filters. Since the collapse of the wavefunction is
postulated to be instantaneous, this signal can be transmitted superluminally.
We show that the method circumvents the no-signalling theorem because the
receiver is able to modify the disentangled wavefunction before his
measurement. We propose a plan for the possible practical realization of a
superluminal quantum telegraph based on the thought experiment.
