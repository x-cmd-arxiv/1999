warm, low density, nonthermal pressure dominated regions. Non-equilibrium
ionization hydrocode simulations are used to predict the high resolution
spectra, ROSAT PSPC countrates, spatial appearance, color temperatures, and the
O VII and O VIII emission line fluxes as a function of time.
  For comparisons with observations, this paper also applies the standard
observational analyses for determining the color temperature, electron density,
and thermal pressure to ROSAT ``observations'' of one of the simulated
remnants, thus providing a map between observational results and physical
conditions. The simulated remnants' C IV, N V, and O VI column densities are
also reported.
  The simulations are applied to studies of the Galactic halo and Local Bubble
and additionally may be of interest to studies of external galaxies and
Galactic interarm regions.

concentrated in neutron vortices where the field strength exceeds the critical

early-type spirals can be classified into two broad categories based on the
luminosity of largest HII region in the disk. The first category includes
galaxies for which the individual HII regions have L(H-alpha) < 10^(39) erg/s.
Most of the category 1 galaxies appear to be morphologically undisturbed, but
show a wide diversity in nuclear H-alpha properties. The second category
includes galaxies which have at least one HII region in the disk with
L(H-alpha) > 10^(39) erg/s. All category 2 galaxies show either prominent dust
lanes or other morphological peculiarities such as tidal tails which suggests
that the anomalously luminous HII regions in category 2 galaxies may have
formed as a result of a recent interaction. The observations, which are part of
an on-going H-alpha survey, reveal early-type spirals to be a heterogeneous
class of galaxies that are evolving in the current epoch.
  We have also identified some systematic differences between the
classifications of spiral galaxies in the Second General Catalog (RC2) and the
Revised Shapley-Ames Catalog (RSA) which may be traced to subtle variations in
the application of the criteria used for classifying spiral galaxies. An
examination of earlier studies suggests that perceptions concerning the Hubble

hydromagnetic stresses deform the star, creating a fractional difference
epsilon=(I_3-I_1)/I_1 ~ 10^{-8} between the principal moments of inertia I_1
and I_3; the resulting Eulerian precession couples to an oscillating component
of the electromagnetic torque associated with the near-zone radiation fields,
and the star executes an anharmonic wobble with period tau_pr ~ 2 pi / epsilon
Omega(t) ~ 10 yr, where Omega(t) is the rotation frequency as a function of
time t. We solve Euler's equations for a biaxial magnet rotating in vacuo; show

functionals characterise the morphology of an object, they are: its perimeter
(L), area (S), and genus. Out of L and S a single dimensionless Shapefinder

circle (F = 0) and a filament (F = 1). Using F, we quantify the extent of
filamentarity in the LCRS by comparing our results with a Poisson distribution
with similar geometrical properties and having the same selection function as
the survey. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that the LCRS displays a high
degree of filamentarity both in the Northern and Southern galactic sections a
result that is in general agreement with the visual appearance of the
catalogue. It is well known that gravitational clustering from Gaussian initial
conditions gives rise to the development of non-Gaussianity reflected in the
formation of a network-like filamentary structure on supercluster scales.
Consequently the fact that the smoothed LCRS catalogue shows properties
consistent with those of a Gaussian random field (Colley 1997) whereas the
unsmoothed catalogue demonstrates the presence of filamentarity lends strong
support to the conjecture that the large scale clustering of galaxies is driven
by gravitational instability.

We argue that there is one non-trivial length-scale in the model, analogous to
the correlation length in other systems, which is well-defined in the limit of
infinite system size and which diverges continuously as the randomness in the
network tends to zero, giving a normal critical point in this limit. This
length-scale governs the cross-over from large- to small-world behavior in the
model, as well as the number of vertices in a neighborhood of given radius on
the network. We derive the value of the single critical exponent controlling
behavior in the critical region and the finite size scaling form for the
average vertex-vertex distance on the network, and, using series expansion and
Pade approximants, find an approximate analytic form for the scaling function.
We calculate the effective dimension of small-world graphs and show that this
dimension varies as a function of the length-scale on which it is measured, in
a manner reminiscent of multifractals. We also study the problem of site
percolation on small-world networks as a simple model of disease propagation,
and derive an approximate expression for the percolation probability at which a
giant component of connected vertices first forms (in epidemiological terms,
the point at which an epidemic occurs). The typical cluster radius satisfies
the expected finite size scaling form with a cluster size exponent close to
that for a random graph. All our analytic results are confirmed by extensive
numerical simulations of the model.

studied. It is found that they are characterized by three essential parameters

the theory of quantum field in curved space. The origin of Hawking radiation is
closely related to the fact that a particle which marginally escapes from
collapsing into a black hole is observed at the future infinity with infinitely
large redshift. In other words, such a particle had a very high frequency when
it was near the event horizon. Motivated by the possibility that the property
of Hawking radiation may be altered by some unknowned physics which may exist
beyond some critical scale, Unruh proposed a model which has higher order
spatial derivative terms. In his model, the effects of unknown physics are
modeled so as to be suppressed for the waves with a wavelength much longer than
the critical scale, $k_0^{-1}$. Surprisingly, it was shown that the thermal
spectrum is recovered for such modified models. To introduce such higher order
spatial derivative terms, the Lorentz invariance must be violated because one
special spatial direction needs to be chosen. In previous works, the rest frame
of freely-falling observers was employed as this special reference frame. Here
we give an extension by allowing a more general choice of the reference frame.
Developing the method taken by Corley, % and especially focusing on subluminal
case, we show that the resulting spectrum of created particles again becomes
the thermal one at the Hawking temperature even if the choice of the reference
frame is generalized. Using the technique of the matched asymptotic expansion,
we also show that the correction to the thermal radiation stays of order
$k_0^{-2}$ or smaller when the spectrum of radiated particle around its peak is
concerned.

interesting physics in the neighbourhood of the critical point in the canonical

is characterized by a Landau-Ginzburg model with A_3 potential. The

calculate the slope of the Dirac spectrum at $\lambda = 0$. We also show that

of the system on Wigner hyperplanes, namely in the rest-frame Wigner-covariant
instant form of dynamics. From the study of Dixon's multipoles for the
energy-momentum tensor on the Wigner hyperplanes we derive the definition of
the canonical center-of-mass variable for a Klein-Gordon field configuration:
it turns out that the Longhi-Materassi global variable should be interpreted as
a center of phase of the field configuration. A detailed study of the
kinematical ""external"" and ""internal"" properties of the field configuration on
the Wigner hyperplanes is done. The construction is then extended to charged
Klein-Gordon fields: the centers of phase of the two real components can be
combined to define a global center of phase and a collective relative variable
describing the action-reaction between the two Feshbach-Villars components of
the field with definite sign of energy and charge. The Dixon multipoles for
both the energy-momentum and the electromagnetic current are given. Also the
coupling of the Klein-Gordon field to scalar relativistic particles is studied
and it is shown that in the reduced phase space, besides the particle and field
relative variables, there is also a collective relative variable describing the
relative motion of the particle subsytem with respect to the field one.

Considering the defining fan of the variety as a finite topological space with

sheaf (of graded modules over a sheaf of graded rings) on that ""fan space"". We
prove that this sheaf is a ""minimal extension sheaf"", i.e., that it satisfies
three relatively simple axioms which are known to characterize such a sheaf up
to isomorphism. In the verification of the second of these axioms, a key role
is played by ""equivariantly formal"" toric varieties, where equivariant and
""usual"" (non-equivariant) intersection cohomology determine each other by
Kunneth type formulae. Minimal extension sheaves can be constructed in a purely
formal way and thus also exist for non-rational fans. As a consequence, we can
extend the notion of an equivariantly formal fan even to this general setup. In
this way, it will be possible to introduce ""virtual"" intersection cohomology
for equivariantly formal non-rational fans.

data. In particular, we consider reducing the data set such that the $k$ pions
with lowest $p_T$ are all neutral. We find that, given such cuts, $<R >$ can be
substantially different from 1/3. For example, for a single D$\chi$C domain
without contamination due to incoherently emitted pions, $<R>$ is 3/5 given the
pion with lowest $p_T$ is neutral, and 5/7 given the two pions with lowest
$p_T$ are both neutral, etc.. The effects of multi-domain D$\chi$C formation

the presence of an additional cascading mechanism can change dramatically the
properties and stability of two-wave quadratic solitary waves.

been investigated. Milk and methylene blue doped milk were used as tissue
phantoms for the measurements carried out with a He-Ne laser (632.8nm). Results
indicate that while the technique accurately estimates the transport length, it
can determine the absorption coefficient only when the absorption is moderately
high ($\alpha > 1 cm^{-1}$) for the long transport lengths typical of tissues.
Further, the possibility of determining the anisotropy factor by estimating the
single scattering contribution to the diffuse background is examined.

decoherence times that are several orders of magnitude longer than other

spins as qubits is therefore of potential interest. Here, a scheme that
realizes controlled interactions between two distant quantum dot spins is
proposed. The effective long-range interaction is mediated by the vacuum field
of a high finesse microcavity. By using conduction-band-hole Raman transitions
induced by classical laser fields and the cavity-mode, parallel controlled-not
operations and arbitrary single qubit rotations can be realized. Optical
techniques can also be used to measure the spin-state of each quantum dot.

set of questions arises when one considers the possibility of observing a
tunneling particle while it is in the ``forbidden'' region. In earlier work, we
have discussed how one might probe a tunneling atom ``weakly,'' so as to
prevent collapse. Here we make some observations about the implications of a
more traditional quantum measurement. Considerations of energy conservation
suggest that attempts to observe tunneling atoms will enhance inelastic
scattering, but not in a way which can be directly observed. It is possible
that attempts to make such measurements may lead to experimentally realizable
``observationally assisted barrier penetration.''

well. It is anticipated that similar reductions in particle fluctuations could
occur for other forms of interfering bosonic fields whenever self-interaction
nonlinearities exist, for example, interacting ultracold atoms.

truncating a Laurent series expansion (with leading term) of generic solutions
of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite its utility in
finding Backlund transformations and other remarkable properties of integrable
PDEs, it has not been generally extended to ordinary differential equations
(ODEs). Here we give a new general method that provides such an extension and
show how to apply it to the classical nonlinear ODEs called the Painleve
equations. Our main new idea is to consider mappings that preserve the
locations of a natural subset of the movable poles admitted by the equation. In
this way we are able to recover all known fundamental Backlund transformations
for the equations considered. We are also able to derive Backlund
transformations onto other ODEs in the Painleve classification.
