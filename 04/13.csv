With [S II]/[N II] fairly constant over a large range of H-Alpha intensities,
the increase of [S II]/H-Alpha and [N II]/H-Alpha with |z| seems to reflect an

and permanent effects in the jet morphology. During the interaction, a weak
chain of internal knots develops along the deflected beam and the velocity
field initially has a complex structure that later evolves to a more uniform
distribution. The impact also decreases the beam collimation. This morphology
and kinematics is very similar to that observed in systems like the HH110 jet

Our simulations also reveal the formation of a head-neck structure at the

leave important signatures. The left-overs of the cloud and the knots that are
produced in the deflected beam are deposited into the working surface and
contribute to enrich the knotty pattern commonly observed in HH objects. Also,
the collision may partially destroy the shell at the head producing remarkable
asymmetries. A jet undergoing many transient interactions with compact clumps
along its propagation and life- time may inject a considerable amount of
shocked jet material sideways into the surrounding ambient medium and this may
provide a powerful process for momentum transfer and turbulent mixing with the

While the current data on the temporal and angular broadening of pulsars,

estimates of sizes as large as what we measure. If the sizes and structure are
intrinsic, then the OH(1720 MHz) masrs may be more like the OH(1612 MHz) masers

optical and infrared spectroscopic properties of the Seyfert galaxies are
consistent with the presence of a genuine active galactic nucleus (AGN). About
30% of these galaxies are Seyfert 1s with broad-line regions similar to those
of optical quasars. The percentage of Seyfert 1 ULIGs increases with infrared
luminosity, contrary to the predictions of the standard unification model for
Seyfert galaxies. Comparisons of the broad-line luminosities of optical and
obscured Seyfert 1 ULIGs with those of optically selected quasars of comparable

  galaxies versus damped Lya absorbers","4 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in Astronomy and
  Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  A remarkably small scatter in the N/O ratios for the HII regions in
low-metallicity blue compact galaxies (BCG) has been found recently. It lead to
the conclusion that N and O are both produced by massive stars. Conversely, the
N/Si ratios in damped Lya absorbers (DLA) show a large scatter. This result
provides support for the time-delay model of nitrogen production in
intermediate-mass stars, nitrogen production in massive stars being not
required. The goal of this study is to test whether these observational data
are compatible with each other and with the existing ideas on the chemical
evolution of galaxies.
  We find that it is possible to reconcile the constancy of N/O ratios in
low-metallicity BCGs and the scatter of N/Si ratios in DLAs under the following
three assumptions: 1) a significant part of nitrogen is produced by
intermediate-mass stars, 2) star formation in BCGs and DLAs occurs in bursts
separated by quiescent periods, 3) the previous star formation events are
responsible for measured heavy element abundances of HII regions in BCGs.
  Since the reality of low N/Si ratios in DLAs is not beyond question, the
possibility that the nitrogen in low-metallicity BCGs has been produced by
massive stars cannot be rejected without additional observations.

horizon (EH), (r <= 2 M), of a Black Hole (BH) because the metric coefficients
exhibit singularity at r=2 M, and the radial geodesic of a particle appears to
be null (ds^2 =0) when actually it must be timelike (ds^2 >0), if, indeed, r_g
=2 M >0. Thus, both the exterior and the interior regions of BHs are described
by singularity free Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates. However, we show that, in
this case too, ds^2= 0 for r=2M. And this result can be physically reconciled
only if the EH coincides with the central singularity or if the mass of
Schwarzschild black holes M= 0. This conclusion agrees with the result of our
following paper (astro-ph/9904163) which points out that the Oppenheimer-Snyder
paper showing formation of a BH, too, corresponds to a BH of mass M=0. It means
that Schwarzschild singularity and the central singularity are synonymous, and
there is no spacetime beneath the EH. Hence the concept of ``White Holes'' and
``Other Universes'' suggested by the Kruskal diagram naturally ceases to exist.
We insist that our derivation is straightforward and there is no scope for any
ambiguity, any reader may be able to verify it. The proper time for formation
of a zero mass BH may be seen to be infinite. Therefore at any finite epoch
there would not be any BH. On the other hand, there would be such eternally
collapsing configurations with arbitrary high but finite surface red-shifts. If
accretion onto such collapsing configurations is advection dominated, there
would be little radiation output. Observationally, such collapsing
configurations may be identified as ``Black Holes''.

character is t = log (y+1/y-1), where, at the boundary of the star y=r_b/ r_0 =
r_b /2 M. And since the argument of a logarithmic function can not be negative,

perturbations that possess a built in scale are studied. It is demonstrated
that this assumption leads to a falsifiable class of models. The question of
whether they lead to conflicts with the available observations is addressed.
For this purpose, the power spectrum of the Bardeen potential operator is
calculated and compared with the CMBR anisotropies measurements and the
redshift surveys of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Generic predictions of
the model are: a high first acoustic peak, the presence of a bump in the matter
power spectrum and non-Gaussian statistics. The details are controlled by the
number of quanta in the non-vacuum initial state. Comparisons with observations
show that there exists a window for the free parameters such that good
agreement between the data and the theoretical predictions is possible.
However, in the case where the initial state is a state with a fixed number of
quanta, it is shown that this number cannot be greater than a few. On the other
hand, if the initial state is a quantum superposition, then a larger class of
initial states could account for the observations, even though the state cannot
be too different from the vacuum. Planned missions such as the MAP and Planck
satellites and the Sloan Survey, will demonstrate whether the new class of
models proposed here represents a viable alternative to the standard theory.

perturbation theory in the substrate corrugation potential. For the case of a
step, the magnitude and velocity dependence of the friction force are strongly
dependent on the direction of sliding respect to the step and the corrugation
strength. When the applied force F is perpendicular to the step, the film is
pinned forF less than a critical force Fc. Motion of the film along the step,
however, is not pinned. Fluctuations in the sliding velocity in time provide
evidence of both stick-slip motion and thermally activated creep. Simulations
done with a substrate containing a 5 percent concentration of random point
defects for various directions of the applied force show that the film is

on the classical continuum do not predict the occurrence of shear layers, at
variance with experimental observations. This feature has been attributed to
the absence of a material length scale in their constitutive equations. The
present model incorporates such a material length scale by treating the
granular material as a Cosserat continuum. Thus localised couple stresses exist
and the stress tensor is asymmetric. The velocity profiles predicted by the
model are in close agreement with available experimental data. The predicted
dependence of the shear layer thickness on the width of the channel is in
reasonable agreement with data. In the limit of the ratio of the particle
diameter to the half-width of the channel being small, the model predicts that

experimentally accessible range the conduction band is exactly half-filled,
whereas the band structures are more complex for the optimized structure. By
studying the total energy as a function of unit-cell length and of a possible
bond-length alternation we find that the system can lower its total energy by
letting the bond lengths alternate leading to a structure containing separated
dimers with bond lengths of about 2.5 \AA, largely independent of the
stretching. However, first for fairly large unit cells (above roughly 7 \AA),
is the total-energy gain upon this dimerization comparable with the energy
costs upon stretching. We propose that this together with band-structure
effects is the reason for the larger interatomic distances observed in recent
experiments. We find also that although spin-orbit couplings lead to
significant effects on the band structure, the overall conclusions are not
altered, and that finite Au_2, Au_4, and Au_6 chains possess electronic
properties very similar to those of the infinite chain.

thus only one natural frequency of oscillation for the homogeneous fields,

effects in these models which can significantly change the rate of production
of particles. We perform a general study of the rate of production of the
particles associated with the homogeneous fields, and show how preheating is
efficient in producing these quanta. Preheating of other particle species will
be model dependent, and in order to investigate this we consider a realistic
working model of supersymmetric hybrid inflation which solves the strong-CP
problem via an approximate Peccei-Quinn symmetry, which was proposed by us
previously. We study axion production in this model and show that properly
taking into account the mixing between the fields suppresses the axion
production, yet enhances the production of other particles. Finally we
demonstrate the importance of backreaction effects in this model which have the
effect of shutting off axion production, leaving the axion safely within
experimental bounds.

Chern-Simons gravity theory which leads to the Chern-Simons gravity in the
continuum limit via Ponzano-Regge model. We then summarize the quantization
procedure of the generalized gauge theory and apply the formulation to the
generalized topological Yang-Mills action with instanton gauge fixing. We find
N=2 super Yang-Mills theory with Dirac-K{\""a}hler fermions which are generated
from ghosts via twisting mechanism. The Weinberg-Salam model is formulated by
the generalized Yang-Mills action which includes Connes's non-commutative
geometry formulation as a particular case. In the end a possible scenario to
realize the program is proposed. The formulations given here are by far
incomplete towards the final goal yet include hopeful evidences. This summary

cohomological Hochschild complex of any associative algebra naturally acts the
operad of singular chains in the little discs operad. Recently D. Tamarkin
discovered that the operad of chains of the little discs operad is formal, i.e.
it is homotopy equivalent to its cohomology. From this fact and from Deligne's
conjecture follows almost immediately my formality result in deformation
quantization. I review the situation as it looks now. Also I conjecture that
the motivic Galois group acts on deformation quantizations, and speculate on
possible relations of higher-dimensional algebras and of motives to quantum
field theories.

truncating 3-body correlations. The resulting equations nonperturbatively

the last decade and a variety of approaches have been employed to extract this
fundamental property of matter. Recently, significant differences have emerged
between the results of relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of
breathing mode giant monopole resonance (GMR). This is due to a lack of
understanding of the dynamics of GMR and of its exact relationship to the
compression modulus of the infinite nuclear matter. Here, I present an
alternative approach based upon nuclear shell effects. The shell effects are
known to manifest experimentally in terms of particle-separation energies with
an exceedingly high precision. Within the framework of the non-relativistic
density-dependent Skyrme theory, it is shown that the compressibility of
nuclear matter has a significant influence on shell effects in nuclei. It is
shown that 2-neutron separation energies and hence the empirical shell effects
can be used to constrain the compressibility of nuclear matter.
