inspiral of a black hole-neutron star binary, when the binary separation
becomes comparable to the stellar radius. We use a Newtonian three-dimensional
Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code, and model the neutron star with a
soft (adiabatic index Gamma=5/3) polytropic equation of state and the black
hole as a Newtonian point mass which accretes matter via an absorbing boundary
at the Schwarzschild radius. Our initial conditions correspond to tidally
locked binaries in equilibrium, and we have explored configurations with
different values of the mass ratio q=Mns/Mbh, ranging from q=1 to q=0.1. The
dynamical evolution is followed for approximately 23 ms, and in every case
studied here we find that the neutron star is tidally disrupted on a dynamical
timescale, forming a dense torus around the black hole that contains a few
tenths of a solar mass. A nearly baryon-free axis is present in the system
throughout the coalescence, and only modest beaming of a fireball that could
give rise to a gamma-ray burst would be sufficient to avoid excessive baryon
contamination. We find that some mass (on the order of 0.01 to 0.001 solar
masses) may be dynamically ejected from the system, and could thus contribute
substantially to the amount of observed r-process material in the galaxy. We
calculate the gravitational radiation waveforms and luminosity in the
quadrupole approximation.

Reliable subtraction without Fourier division removes all complexities

lensed images adopted from HST measurements it is relatively easy to fit the
variable part of the flux in this system, as opposed to modeling of the
underlying galaxy. For the first time we observed smooth light variation over a

horizontal. Extremely large intermittency factors Ie and Ic measured for

consistent with the third universal similarity hypothesis for turbulence of

a significant fraction of the group mass lies outside of the galaxies and in a

important for understanding the observed emission. The various attempts by
earlier workers investigating beam shapes have resulted in widely different
conclusions. Using a carefully selected subset of the recently published
multifrequency polarimetry observations of 300 radio pulsars (Gould & Lyne,
1998), we attempt to model the shape of pulsar beams. Assuming that the beam
shape is elliptical, in general, and that it may depend on the angle between
the rotation and the magnetic axes, we seek a consistent model where we also
solve for the dependence of the beam size on frequency. From the six-frequency
data on conal triple and multiple component profiles, we show that a) the
pulsar emission beams follow a nested cone structure with at least three
distinct cones, although only one or more of the cones may be active in a given
pulsar; b) each emission cone is illuminated in the form of an annular ring of
width typically about 20% of the cone radius.
  Although some slight preference is evident for a model where the beam is
circular for an aligned rotator & latitudinally compressed for an orthogonal
rotator, the possibility that the beam shape is circular at all inclinations is
found to be equally consistent with the data. While the overall size scales as
$P^{-0.5}$ (where $P$ is the pulsar period) as expected from the notion of
dipolar open field lines, we see no evidence in support of the beam shape
evolution with pulsar period.

three-dimensional perovskite lattice, as in KCuF_3, where at each site the
doubly degenerate eg orbitals contain a single hole. The model describes the
superexchange interactions that depend on the pattern of orbitals occupied. We
present the ground state properties of this model, depending on the splitting
between the eg orbitals E_z, and the Hund's rule coupling in the excited d8
states, J_H. The classical phase diagram consists of six magnetic phases which
all have different orbital ordering: two antiferromagnetic (AF) phases with
G-AF order and either x2-y2 or 3z2-r2 orbitals occupied, two phases with mixed
orbital (MO) patterns and A-AF order, and two other MO phases with either C-AF
or G-AF order. All of them become degenerate at the multicritical point
M=(E_z,J_H)=(0,0). Using a generalization of linear spin-wave theory we study
both the transverse excitations which are spin-waves and
spin-and-orbital-waves, as well as the longitudinal (orbital) excitations. The
transverse modes couple to each other, and the spin-and-orbital-wave turns into
a soft mode near the M point. Therefore, quantum corrections to the
long-range-order parameter are drastically increased near the orbital
degeneracy, and classical order is suppressed in a crossover regime between the
G-AF and A-AF phases in the (E_z,J_H) plane. This behavior is reminiscent of
that found in frustrated spin models, and we conclude that orbital degeneracy
provides a new and physically realizable mechanism which stabilizes a spin
liquid ground state due to inherent frustration of magnetic interactions. We
also point out that such a disordered magnetic phase is likely to be realized

prototypes achieve varying degrees of machine-independence with novel designs.
Cdb, a simple source-level debugger for C, is completely independent of its
target architecture. This independence is achieved by embedding symbol tables
and debugging code in the target program, which costs both time and space. This
paper describes a revised design and implementation of cdb that reduces the
space cost by nearly one-half and the time cost by 13% by storing symbol tables
in external files. A symbol table is defined by a 31-line grammar in the
Abstract Syntax Description Language (ASDL). ASDL is a domain-specific language
for specifying tree data structures. The ASDL tools accept an ASDL grammar and
generate code to construct, read, and write these data structures. Using ASDL
automates implementing parts of the debugger, and the grammar documents the
symbol table concisely. Using ASDL also suggested simplifications to the
interface between the debugger and the target program. Perhaps most important,
ASDL emphasizes that symbol tables are data structures, not file formats. Many
of the pitfalls of working with low-level file formats can be avoided by
focusing instead on high-level data structures and automating the
implementation details.

After summarizing the standard embedding results, we concentrate on

five-branes are present. We analyze in detail the different scales of the
theory, eleven-dimensional Planck mass, compactification scale, orbifold scale,
and how they are related taking into account higher order corrections. To
obtain the phenomenologically favored GUT scale is easier than in standard
embedding vacua. To lower this scale to intermediate ($\approx 10^{11}$ GeV) or
1 TeV values or to obtain the radius of the orbifold as large as a millimetre
is possible. However, we point out that these special limits are unnatural.
Finally, we perform a systematic analysis of the soft supersymmetry-breaking
terms. We point out that scalar masses larger than gaugino masses can easily be
obtained unlike the standard embedding case and the weakly-coupled heterotic
string.

locally Lipshitz in $x$, and if necessary, several times continuously
differentiable in $t$ and $x$. We associate a conditioning function $E(t)$ with
each solution $x(t)$ which captures the accumulation of global error in a
numerical approximation in the following sense: if $\tilde{x}(t;h)$ is an
approximation derived from a single step method of time step $h$ and order $r$

paper gives conditions on $x(t)$ for $E(t)$ to be upper bounded linearly or by
a constant for $t\geq 0$. More concretely, these techniques give constant or

falls into a stable, hyperbolic fixed point; or into a stable, hyperbolic
cycle; or into a normally hyperbolic and contracting manifold with
quasiperiodic flow on the manifold.

limit on the effective neutrino Majorana mass, a quantity of fundamental
importance. To test our ability to evaluate the nuclear matrix elements that
govern the decay rate, it is desirable to be able to describe the allowed
two-neutrino decay. It is argued that only low-lying virtual intermediate
states are important for that process, and thus it appears that the large-scale
shell model evaluation, free from the various difficulties of QRPA, is the
preferred method. In the $0\nu$ decay, it is shown that there is a substantial
cancellation between the paired and broken pair pieces of the nuclear wave
function. Thus, despite the popular claim to the contrary, one expects that the
$0\nu$ rate is also sensitive to the details of nuclear structure. This is
reflected in the spread of the theoretical values, leading to the uncertainty
of about factor 2-3 in the deduced $<m_{\nu}>$ limit. Finally, brief comment
about the $0\nu$ decay with the exchange of a very heavy neutrino are made.
