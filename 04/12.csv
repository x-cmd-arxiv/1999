remarkably flat (in nu F_nu-space) up to high energies. We find that the
spectral shape can be successfully fitted by the shocked synchrotron emission
model of Tavani. We present evidence that the flatness of the spectrum at high

have long been known to be inconsistent with circular motion in an axisymmetric
potential. Several lines of evidence suggest that the Galaxy is barred, and gas
flow in a barred potential could be consistent with the observed ``forbidden''
velocities and other features in the data. We compare the H I observations to
l-V diagrams synthesized from 2-D fluid dynamical simulations of gas flows in a
family of barred potentials. The gas flow pattern is very sensitive to the
parameters of the assumed potential, which allows us to discriminate among
models. We present a model that reproduces the outer contour of the H I l-V
diagram reasonably well; this model has a strong bar with a semimajor axis of
3.6 kpc, an axis ratio of approximately 3:1, an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR),
and a pattern speed of 42 km/s/kpc, and matches the data best when viewed from
34\deg to the bar major axis. The behavior of the models, combined with the
constraint that the shocks in the Milky Way bar should resemble those in
external barred galaxies, leads us to conclude that wide ranges of parameter
space are incompatible with the observations. In particular we suggest that the
bar must be fairly strong, must have an ILR, and cannot be too end-on, with the
bar major axis at 35\deg +/- 5\deg to the line of sight. The H I data exhibit
larger forbidden velocities over a wider longitude range than are seen in
molecular gas; this important difference is the reason our favored model
differs so significantly from other recently proposed models.

cosmology with a tired-light redshift. The idea is that the high energy
particles in the inter-galactic medium do not travel along geodesics because of
the strong electrostatic forces. The result is a reaction back on the medium
that is seen as an additional pressure. Combined with the explanation of the
Hubble redshift as a gravitational interaction results in a static and stable
cosmology. The predicted Hubble constant is 60.2 km/s/Mpc, the predicted
background microwave temperature is 3 degrees and quasar luminosity functions
and angular size distributions are shown to be consistent with the model. Since
most observations that imply dark matter rely on redshift data it is argued
that there is no dark matter. Observations of quasar absorption lines,
supernovae light curves and the Butcher-Oemler effect are discussed. The
curvature pressure is important for stellar structure and may explain the solar

the range 8 to 25 M_sun is followed through all stages of stable evolution. The
initial angular momentum is chosen such that the star's equatorial rotational
velocity on the ZAMS ranges from zero to ~ 70 % of break-up. Redistribution of
angular momentum and chemical species are then followed as a consequence of
rotationally induced circulation and instablities. The effects of the
centrifugal force on the stellar structure are included. Uncertain mixing
efficiencies are gauged by observations. We find, as noted in previous work,
that rotation increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar
envelopes with products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time,
the angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with
their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to (non-magnetic)
stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum during core hydrogen
burning are of crucial importance for the specific angular momentum of the
core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find angular momentum transport from the
core to the envelope to be unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain
specific angular momenta for the iron core and overlaying material of
1E16...1E17 erg s. These values are insensitive to the initial angular
momentum. They are small enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core
before it collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to
break-up. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of
gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation rates of
young pulsars is discussed.

have a normal photoionization spectrum, that is, line ratios reproductible from
nebular conditions and ionizing star radiation field normally encountered in
extragalactic HII regions. There is an indication, however, that their degree
of ionization might be somewhat different. Another ionization mechanism
(high-velocity shocks or hard UV radiation) is clearly present for regions
found nearby the centers of the galaxies. The electronic density of the regions
along the bars is very close to that of disc regions ($<N_e > \sim 80
cm^{-3}$). On average, bar and disc regions have a similar visual extinction
($A_V \sim 1$ mag) with exceptions for some regions located near the bar dust
lanes of the earlier types of galaxies in our sample. Although the average
H$\alpha$ equivalent width of bar HII regions ($\sim$250 {\AA}) is half that of
disc regions, this disparity could be due to uncertainties in the galactic
continuum and does not translate into a significant age difference. The oxygen
abundance distribution was also investigated in the bar of these galaxies. The
O/H scatter was found to be very small (<0.1 dex) indicating that mixing of the

longer periods, there is an overlapping with the values obtained in the case of
galactic stars. Toward shorter periods, the tendency to decreasing phi_21
values is also verified. A careful analysis should take more details in
consideration: 1) Attention should be paid to the scatter in the distribution
of the phi_21 parameters around 0.050 d. By analogy to Cepheid light curves,
such a change can be the signature of a resonance between the fundamental mode
and a higher overtone. 2) The small bunch of points above the progression at
0.038 d suggests a different light curve family. Since this group of stars
shows a very small amplitude, it is possible that they are nonradial pulsators,
not necessarily radial pulsators in a higher overtone. 3) The very low phi_21

light curve is observed in a Pop.II object is quite surprising, since V1719 Cyg

strength of the external field is comparable with the Coulomb field. Moreover,
the approximate analytical criterion (taking into account the electron's energy
increase by the influence of the field) yields a threshold field strength quite

$q$-dependent FSI from the AL. In general it suffices to know the structure of
the theory, but not numerical results. It appears, that in the $q$-range of the
analyzed electron scattering data, FSI are only weakly $q$-dependent, making it
virtually impossible to obtain parameters in a free fit of the parametrized
components of $f$. Imposing a restriction, we obtain $n(p)$ for Fe and $^4$Fe.

a nucleon and a nucleus of point-nucleons. The latter contains nuclear
dynamics, e.g. binary collision contributions in addition to the asymptotic
limit. The agreement with the data is good, except in low-intensity regions.
Computed ternary collsion contributions appear too small for an explanation. We
perform scaling analyses in Gurvitz's scaling variable and found that for
$y_G\gtrless 0$, ratios of scaling functions for pairs of nuclei differ by less
than 15-20% from 1. Scaling functions for $<y_G>0$ are, for increasing $Q^2$,
shown to approach a plateau from above. We observe only weak $Q^2$-dependence
in FSI, which in the relevant kinematic region is ascribed to the diffractive
nature of the NN amplitudes appearing in FSI. This renders it difficult to
separate asymptotic from FSI parts and seriously hampers the extraction of
$n(p)$ from scaling analyses in a model-independnent fashion.

are relevant to the traversal time measurements. The Faraday polarization
filtering may cause the loss of non-local (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) two-photon

accuracy. We show that a mechanism of destructive interference between

excitation between the atom and the cavity, in order to realize nearly unitary
dynamics of the internal atomic states and the cavity mode which is required
for several schemes of current interest such as quantum computing. Using a
simple model we establish ultimate effects of the external atomic degrees of
freedom on the action of quantum gates. The perfomance of the gate is
characterized by a measure based on the entanglement fidelity and the motional
excitation caused by the action of the gate is calculated. We find that schemes
which rely on adiabatic passage, and are not therefore critically dependent on
laser pulse areas, are very much more robust against interaction with the
external degrees of freedom of atoms in the quantum gate.
