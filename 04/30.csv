small angular scales, while coronographs have been used to study high contrast
sources. We propose launching the Big Occulting Steerable Satellite (BOSS), a
large steerable occulting satellite to combine both of these techniques. BOSS
will have several advantages over standard occulting bodies. BOSS would block
all but about 4e-5 of the light at 1 micron in the region of interest around
the star for planet detections. Because the occultation occurs outside the
telescope, scattering inside the telescope does not degrade this performance.
BOSS could be combined with a space telescope at the Earth-Sun L2 point to
yield very long integration times, in excess of 3000 seconds. If placed in
Earth orbit, integration times of 160--1600 seconds can be achieved from most
major telescope sites for objects in over 90% of the sky. Applications for BOSS
include direct imaging of planets around nearby stars. Planets separated by as
little as 0.1--0.25 arcseconds from the star they orbit could be seen down to a
relative intensity as little as 1e-9 around a magnitude 8 (or brighter) star.
Other applications include ultra-high resolution imaging of compound sources,
such as microlensed stars and quasars, down to a resolution as little as 0.1
milliarcseconds.

confirms that the signal arises predominantly from the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation for multipoles in the lower half of this range; the
average broad-band power in a bin with centroid l=422 (theta = 51') is
estimated to be Delta_T/T=2.1^{+0.4}_{-0.5} x 10^{-5}. For multipoles centred

consistent with the first detection made by CAT in a completely different area

weight to earlier evidence from CAT for a downturn in the CMB power spectrum on

The optical afterglow for the wind case is generally expected to decline more
steeply than in the constant density case, but this effect may be masked by
variations in electron spectral index, and the two cases have the same
evolution in the cooling regime. Observations of the concurrent radio and
optical/X-ray evolution are especially useful for distinguishing between the

entirely due to the action of the jets on the surrounding star and does not

lines, formed in the inner regions of C-rich giant atmospheres, is rather weak.
Therefore the use of these lines is recommended for Li determination in AGB
stars. However, in no case can we properly account for the formation of Li
lines in AGB stars until sphericity, velocity stratifications, dust,
chromospheres and other related phenomena, which are in fact present in AGB
star atmospheres, are considered. Our results are used to derive Li abundances

linear, possess group properties and lead to the Einstein law of addition of

serve as relativistic symmetry transformations of a flat anisotropic Finslerian
event space rather than of Minkowski space. Consideration is given to two types
of Finsler spaces which generalize locally isotropic Riemannian space-time of

here) and defined as S_OZI= \lim_(m_c\to \Lambda_c) SU(2)_ud * SU(2)_cd * U(1)
with the two SU(2) groups acting in turn onto the 1st and 2nd quark generations
rather than Gell-Mann's eightfold SU(3)_F. Within this scheme the presence of
non-strange quarkonium components in the wave function of the physical eta and
f_1(1285) mesons appears necessarily through the violation of the OZI rule for
the pseudoscalar and axial vector mesons by the anomalous axial U(1)_A baryon
number current and not by a primordial octet flavor symmetry. The physical
observable which selects the S_OZI over the SU(3)_F scheme is the
non-isotriplet part of the neutral axial current. In the case of the S_OZI
symmetry the only non-isotriplet neutral axial current having a well defined
chiral limit is purely strange, while within the SU(3)_F framework it is the
octet axial current which is supposed to be partially conserved. Accordingly,
while in the latter case the tree level eta N coupling is of significant
strength, its almost vanishes in the former, in agreement with data, thus
confirming the relevance of the S_OZI symmetry.

m_omega - m_rho ~= 25 MeV is obtained from the pi pi, K K(bar), omega pi, rho

obtaining thereby ""Bures prior probability distributions"" over the two- and
three-state systems. Then, as an essential first step in extending these
results to n > 3, we determine that the ""Hall normalization constant"" (C_{n})

is, for n = 4, equal to 71680/pi^2. Since we also find that C_{3} = 35/pi, it
follows that C_{4} is simply equal to 2^{11} C_{3}/pi. (C_{2} itself is known

remarkably simple decompositon, involving the product of the eight consecutive

sensitivity of $f$. This lower bound is tight for some functions. We also show
for any polynomial $\tilde{f}$ that approximates $f$ with error probability
$\epsilon$, $deg(\tilde{f}) \ge 1/4 (1 - \frac{3 \epsilon}{1 + \epsilon})^2
\rho_f N$. This bound can be better than previous known lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{BS_f})$ for some functions. Our technique may be of intest
itself: we apply Fourier analysis to functions mapping $\{0, 1\}^N$ to unit
vectors in a Hilbert space. From this viewpoint, the state of the quantum
computer at step $t$ can be written as $\sum_{s\in \{0, 1\}^N, |s| \le t}
\hat{\phi}_s (-1)^ {s \cdot x}$, which is handy for lower bound analysis.

the gates F_1,...,F_m is a classical procedure that, given any gates
G_1,...,G_m, decides with high probability if each G_i is close to F_i. This
decision has to rely only on measuring in the computational basis the effect of
iterating the gates on the classical states. It turns out that instead of
individual gates, we can only design procedures for families of gates. To
achieve our goal we borrow some elegant ideas of the theory of program testing:
we characterize the gate families by specific properties, we develop a theory
of robustness for them, and show that they lead to self-testers. In particular
we prove that the universal and fault-tolerant set of gates consisting of a
Hadamard gate, a c-NOT gate, and a phase rotation gate of angle pi/4 is
self-testable.
