covered by an ultradeep (229 ks) ROSAT HRI image, 51 X-ray sources are detected
with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 3.5. About half of these sources are
associated with the galaxy. We determine the average luminosity distribution of
the sources.
  We have examined spatial, spectral, and timing properties of the X-ray
sources. In particular, we have explored the nature of various superluminous
X-ray sources with luminosities significantly greater than the Eddington limit
for a $\sim 1.6 M_\odot$ object (neutron star). These X-ray sources, detected
in various ROSAT HRI and PSPC observations, are not transients and appear to
result from recent massive star formation in outer spiral arms. 3 superluminous
PSPC sources are associated with giant HII complexes and are clearly resolved.
2 other superluminous RHRI sources are likely associated with shell-like
supernova (or more likely hypernova) remnants, which are known to be abnormally
luminous in optical and/or radio. We further identify 2 superluminous sources,
which all show highly-absorbed
  X-ray spectra and time variability during and/or between the observations, as
candidates for X-ray binary systems that contain black holes.
  A comparison of 7 nearby spirals shows that their X-ray source luminosity
distributions, normalized by total HI masses, are very similar. But both the
number of superluminous X-ray sources and the total X-ray luminosity appear to
be correlated with the star forming rate of a galaxy.

the lightest of these particles, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), is
stable and will hence survive to the present day. We calculate the limit on the
initial abundance of PBHs from the requirement that the present day LSP density
is less than the critical density. We apply this limit, along with those
previously obtained from the effects of PBH evaporation on nucleosynthesis and
the present day density of PBHs, to PBHs formed from the collpase of
inflationary density perturbations, in the context of supersymmetric inflation
models. If the reheat temperature after inflation is low, so as to avoid the
overproduction of gravitinos and moduli, then the lightest PBHs which are
produced in significant numbers will be evaporating around the present day and
there are therefore no constraints from the effects of the evaporation products
on nucleosynthesis or from the production of LSPs. We then examine models with
a high reheat temperature and a subsequent period of thermal inflation. In
these models avoiding the overproduction of LSPs limits the abundance of low
mass PBHs which were previously unconstrained. Throughout we incorporate the
production, at fixed time, of PBHs with a range of masses, which occurs when
critical collapse is taken into account.

situated in the M 81 group at a distance of about 3.2 Mpc) reveal that their
neutral interstellar medium (ISM) is dominated by hole-like features most of
which are expanding. A comparison of the physical properties of these holes
with the ones found in more massive spiral galaxies (such as M 31 and M 33)
shows that they tend to reach much larger sizes in dwarf galaxies. This can be
understood in terms of the galaxy's gravitational potential. The origin of
these features is still a matter of debate. In general, young star forming
regions (OB-associations) are held responsible for their formation. This
picture, however, is not without its critics and other mechanism such as the
infall of high velocity clouds, turbulent motions or even gamma ray bursters
have been recently proposed. Here I will present one example of a supergiant
shell in IC 2574 which corroborates the picture that OB associations are indeed
creating these structures. This particular supergiant shell is currently the
most promising case to study the effects of the combined effects of stellar
winds and supernova-explosions which shape the neutral interstellar medium of

for different redshift distributions, including that appropriate for the APM

1$ (such as the VLA FIRST Survey). Qualitatively, many of the results found for
$s_3$ and $q$ are similar to those obtained in a related treatment of the

of the configuration dependence of $q$ to both cosmological and biasing models.
We show that since angular CFs are sensitive to clustering over a range of
redshifts, the various evolutionary dependences included in our predictions
imply that measurements of $q$ in a deep survey might better discriminate
between models with different histories, such as evolving vs. non-evolving
bias, that can have similar spatial CFs at low redshift. Our calculations
employ a derived equation---valid for open, closed, and flat models---for

fit by a simple empirical analytic expression, the origin is likely due to a
number of distinct source components. The prevailing idea for the origin is
that the hard X-ray spectrum is due to X-rays from various AGN components,
particularly Seyfert galaxies extending to cosmological distances, and that the
low energy gamma-rays may be due to emission from type 1a Supernovae, also
integrated to cosmological distances. The higher energy gamma-ray spectrum

expanding HI shells and holes in its neutral interstellar medium. These
features range in size from about 100 (a limit set by the size of the beam) to
about 1000 pc dominating the appearance of the HI surface brightness map. Their
dynamics clearly influence the velocity field of IC 2574. Current star
formation, as traced by H-alpha emission, is predominantly found along the rims

dispersion of about 7 km/s). A comparison with other galaxies shows that the
energies needed to create the expanding HI structures are the same for all

the instrumental and/or atmospheric PSF. We construct a `finite resolution
shear operator' which when applied to an observed image has the same effect as
a gravitational shear applied prior to smearing. This operator allows one to
calibrate essentially any shear estimator. We then specialize to the case of
weighted second moment shear estimators. We compute the shear polarizability
which gives the response of an individual galaxy's polarization to a
gravitational shear. We then compute the response of the population of

estimates from galaxies of various shapes, luminosities and sizes. We define a
figure of merit --- an inverse shear variance per unit solid angle --- which
characterizes the quality of image data for shear measurement. The new method

population and predicts high star formation rates at redshifts 3 to 4,
consistent with recent extinction-corrected observations of Lyman break
galaxies. Starbursting galaxies are predicted to dominate the current SCUBA
surveys. Their star formation is driven predominantly by strong tidal
interactions and mergers of galaxies. This leads to the creation of spheroidal
stellar systems, which may act as the seeds for disk formation as gas infalls.

  contents, p.13/04, 2000",,,"astro-ph",,"  The JVAS (Jodrell Bank-VLA Astrometric Survey) and CLASS (Cosmic Lens All-Sky
Survey) are well-defined surveys containing about ten thousand flat-spectrum
radio sources. For many reasons, flat-spectrum radio sources are particularly
well-suited as a population from which one can obtain unbiased samples of
gravitational lenses. These are by far the largest gravitational (macro)lens
surveys, and particular attention was paid to constructing a cleanly-defined
sample for the survey itself and for the underlying luminosity function. Here
we present the constraints on cosmological parameters, particularly the
cosmological constant, derived from JVAS and combine them with constraints from
optical gravitational lens surveys, `direct' measurements of $\Omega_{0}$,
$H_{0}$ and the age of the universe, and constraints derived from CMB
anisotropies, before putting this final result into the context of the latest
results from other, independent cosmological tests.

clusters of the Galaxy, the LMC and SMC are examined. In order to disentangle
age and metallicity effects we choose clusters in the same age interval and for
which reliable photometric and spectroscopic data are available. Number counts
are made for various magnitude intervals, and the results are found to be
stable with respect to this choice. In the magnitude interval Mv = -5 to -1.4
(i.e. O9 to B3) we obtained a ratio Be/(B+Be) = 0.11, 0.19, 0.23, 0.39 for 21
clusters located in the interior of the Galaxy, the exterior of the Galaxy, the
LMC and the SMC, respectively.
  Various hypotheses for these differences are examined. An interesting
possibility is that the average rotation is faster at low metallicities as a
result of star formation processes. The much higher relative N-enrichment found
by Venn et al. (1998) in A-type supergiants of the SMC, compared to galactic
supergiants, also strongly supports the presence of more rotational mixing at
low metallicities. We discuss whether high rotational mixing may be the source
of primary nitrogen in the early chemical evolution of galaxies.

collision between an extragalactic jet and a dense, intergalactic cloud,
through a series of hydrodynamic simulations. Such collisions are often
suggested to explain the distorted structures of some radio jets. However,
theoretical studies of this mechanism are in conflict over whether it can
actually reproduce the observations.
  The parameters are the Mach number, and the relative densities of the jet and
the cloud to the ambient medium. Using a simple prescription we have produced
synthetic radio images for comparison with observations. These show that a
variety of structures may be produced from simple jet-cloud collisions. We
illustrate this with a few examples, and examine the details in one case. In
most cases we do not see a clear, sustained deflection. Lighter jets are
completely disrupted. The most powerful jets produce a hotspot at the impact
which outshines any jet emission and erode the cloud too quickly to develop a
deflected arm. It appears that moderate Mach numbers and density contrasts are
needed to produce bends in the radio structure. This explains the apparent
conflict between theoretical studies, as conclusions were based on different
values of these parameters. Shocks are produced in the ambient medium that
might plausibly reproduce the observed alignment of the extended emission line
regions with the radio axis.

  The survey observations were made with the ISOCAM instrument of the ISO
satellite. The filter bands chosen were LW2(~7 microns) and LW3(~15 microns).
  The results presented here show that most of the detected objects are late
M-type giants on the AGB, with a cut-off for those earlier than M3-M4. The most
luminous members of these two Bulge fields at 7 microns are the Mira variables.
However, it is evident that they represent the end of a sequence of increasing
15 micron dust emission which commences with M giants of earlier sub-type.
  In observations of late-type giants the ISOCAM 15 micron band is mainly
sensitive to the cool silicate or aluminate dust shells which overwhelm the
photospheric emission. However, in ordinary M-giant stars, the 7 micron band is
not strongly affected by dust emission and may be influenced instead by
absorption. The nu2 band of water at 6.25 microns and the SiO fundamental at
7.9 microns are likely contribitors to this effect.
  A group of late M stars has been found which vary little or not at all but
have infrared colours typical of well-developed dust shells. Their luminosities
are similar to those of 200-300 day Miras but they have slightly redder
[7]-[15] colours which form an extension of the ordinary M giant sequence.

with nuclear time-scale driven mass transfer from a giant. This solution is
based on the well-known fact that the luminosity and the radius of a giant
scale to a good approximation as simple power laws of the mass M_c of the
degenerate helium core. Comparison with results of numerical calculations by
Webbink, Rappaport & Savonije (1983) show the analytical solution and the power
law approximation to be quite accurate. The analytical solution presented does
also allow (in parametrized form) for non-conservative mass transfer.
Furthermore it is shown that the near constancy of the mass transfer rate over
most of the mass transfer phase seen in the results by Webbink, Rappaport &
Savonije is not a generic feature of this type of evolution but rather a
consequence of a particular choice of parameters. The analytical solution also
demonstrates that the level of mass transfer is largely set by the core mass of
the giant at the onset of mass transfer. Finally we show that the model is
selfconsistent and discuss its applicability to low-mass X-ray binaries.

covers 47.2 arcmin^2 to K(3\sigma)<20 whilst a second, deeper survey covers a
sub-area of 1.8 arcmin^2 to K(3\sigma)<22.75. Over the entire area we have
extremely deep UBRI photometry. Our K- counts are consistent with the
predictions of non-evolving models with 0 < q0 <0.5. The K-selected (B-K)
galaxy colour distributions move sharply bluewards fainter than K~20 and at at
brighter magnitudes (K<20) our observed colour distributions indicate a
deficiency of red, early-type galaxies at z~1 in comparison with passively
evolving models. This implies either a pure luminosity evolution (PLE) model
with a low level of continuing star-formation following an an initial burst, or
dynamical merging. At fainter magnitudes, the continuing bluewards trend
observed in (B-K) can be explained purely in terms of passively evolving PLE
models. Our observed numbers of (I-K)>4 galaxies at K<20 exhibit the same
deficiency, suggesting that at least part of the larger deficit observed in
(B-K) at K<20 may be due to star-formation rather than dynamical merging.
Finally, as we and others have noted, the number-redshift distribution at
18<K<19 of recent, deep K- selected redshift surveys is well fitted by
non-evolving models; passively evolving models with a Salpeter or Scalo initial
mass functions overpredict the numbers of galaxies with z>1. Dynamical merging
is one possible solution to reduce the numbers of these galaxies but a
dwarf-dominated IMF for early-type galaxies could offer an alternative
explanation; we show that this model reproduces both the optical-infrared

and boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges. We first review and discuss proposed
mechanisms for their formation, focussing on accretion and bar-buckling
scenarios. Using new methods relying on the kinematics of edge-on disks, we
then look for bars in a large sample of edge-on spiral galaxies with a B/PS
bulge and in a smaller control sample of edge-on spirals with more spheroidal
bulges. We present position-velocity diagrams of the ionised gas obtained from
optical long-slit spectroscopy. We show that almost all B/PS bulges are due to
a thick bar viewed edge-on, while only a few extreme cases may be due to the
accretion of external material. This strongly supports the bar-buckling
mechanism for the formation of B/PS bulges. None of the galaxies in the control
sample shows evidence for a bar, which suggests conversely that bars are
generally B/PS.
  We consider the effects of dust in the disk of the galaxies, but conclude
that it does not significantly affect our results. Unusual emission line ratios
correlating with kinematical structures are observed in many objects, and we
argue that this is consistent with the presence of strong bars in the disk of
the galaxies. As expected from N-body simulations, the boxy--peanut transition
appears to be related to the viewing angle, but more work is required to derive
the precise orientation of the bars in the bulges. The reliable identification
of bars in edge-on spiral galaxies opens up for the first time the possibility
of studying observationally their vertical structure.

including the Milky Way, spiral disks and bulges, and elliptical and lenticular
galaxies. Conclusions that span the galaxy types treated here are as follows.
All galaxies, on average, have heavy element abundances (metallicities) that
systematically decrease outward from their galactic centers while their global
metallicities increase with galaxy mass. Abundance gradients are steepest in
normal spirals and are seen to be progressively flatter going in order from
barred spirals, lenticulars, and ellipticals. For spiral galaxies, local
metallicity appears to be correlated with total (disk plus bulge) surface
density. Observed abundance patterns indicate that N production is dominated by
primary processes at low metallicity and secondary processes at high
metallicity; C production increases with increasing metallicity; and O, Ne, S,
and Ar are produced in lockstep independent of metallicity. In elliptical
galaxies, nuclear abundances are in the range [Z/H] = 0.0 to 0.4, but the
element mixture is not scaled-solar. In large elliptical galaxies [Mg/Fe] is in
the range 0.3 to 0.5, decreasing to ~0 in smaller elliptical galaxies. Other
light elements track the Mg enhancement, but the heavier Ca tracks Fe. Velocity
dispersion appears to be a key parameter in the modulation of [Mg/Fe], but the
cause of the connection is unclear.

  A particularly interesting question is what happens to the 1d Luttinger
liquid, as we go from 1d to 2d? The main point of emphasis of the present note
is that the transition from 1d to 2d has an underlying quantum group symmetry.
This relationhip of 1d to 2d transition with quantum group symmetry ties in
nicely with our previous proposal to model superconductivity,
antiferromagnetism and related phases arising from strongly correlated electron
states with quantum groups. A simple model based on two interacting chains with
nearest neighbor and next to nearest neighbor interactions is suggested.
  It appears reasonable to assume that it is the interaction between the 1d
Luttinger liquids which leads to the quantum group symmetry and the transition
to 2d quantum liquid. The conditions under which this 2d quantum liquid
deviates away from the 2d Fermi liquid is clearly of main interest to us. One
of the prime motivations underlying our proposal is the experimental
observation of stripe structure [phase] in high T_c superconductivity [HTSC]
materials. In short a simple model of two coupled chains 1d chains is
considered to answer an important question, how does one couple two 1d chains

Red Shift, could be produced by the existence of the dilaton field is explored.
The analysis starts from previously studied solutions of the Einstein equations
for gravity interacting with a massive scalar field. It is firstly underlined
that such solutions can produce the observed values of the Hubble constant.
Since the Einstein-Klein-Gordon lagrangian could be expected to appear as an
effective one for the dilaton in some approximation, the mentioned solutions
are applied to study this field. Therefore, the vacuum expectation value for
the dilaton is selected to be of the order of the Planck mass, as it is
frequently fixed in string phenomenology. Then, it follows that the value of
its effective mass should be as low as m=3.9 10^(-29) cm^(-1) in order produce
the observed expansion rate. The discussion can also predict a radius of the
Universe of the order of 10^(29) cm. Finally, after adopting the view advanced
ina previous work, in which these mentioned solutions are associated to
interior configurations of collapsed scalar fields, a picture of our Universe

the fact that the particles can be identified with the analytically continued

always been to call for mathematical devices --- prescriptions --- some

consider the propagator from its physical point of view, that is, an object
obeying basic principles such as causality. Once this fact is realized and
carefully taken into account, the crutch of prescriptions can be avoided
altogether. An alternative third approach, which for practical computations
could dispense with prescriptions as well as prescinding the necessity of
careful stepwise watching out of causality would be of great advantage. And

corresponding Howe dual pair. Constrained quantization is then performed in
replacing the classical procedure of symplectic reduction by the

performed with respect to either $U(M)$, which is straightforward, or $U(M,N)$.
In the latter case one induces from holomorphic discrete series

currently indicates non-unitarity of the KM matrix.

C60 (1999) 035202","10.1103/PhysRevC.60.035202","NT@UW-99-9","nucl-th hep-ph",,"  A relativistic light front formulation of nuclear dynamics is developed and
applied to treating infinite nuclear matter in a method which includes the
correlations of pairs of nucleons: this is light front Brueckner theory. We
start with a hadronic meson-baryon Lagrangian that is consistent with chiral
symmetry. This is used to obtain a light front version of a one-boson-exchange
nucleon-nucleon potential (OBEP). The accuracy of our description of the
nucleon-nucleon (NN) data is good, and similar to that of other relativistic
OBEP models. We derive, within the light front formalism, the Hartree-Fock and
Brueckner Hartree-Fock equations. Applying our light front OBEP, the nuclear
matter saturation properties are reasonably well reproduced. We obtain a value
of the compressibility, 180 MeV, that is smaller than that of alternative
relativistic approaches to nuclear matter in which the compressibility usually
comes out too large. Because the derivation starts from a meson-baryon
Lagrangian, we are able to show that replacing the meson degrees of freedom by
a NN interaction is a consistent approximation, and the formalism allows one to
calculate corrections to this approximation in a well-organized manner. The
simplicity of the vacuum in our light front approach is an important feature in
allowing the derivations to proceed. The mesonic Fock space components of the
nuclear wave function are obtained also, and aspects of the meson and nucleon
plus-momentum distribution functions are computed. We find that there are about
0.05 excess pions per nucleon.

of certain even-even and neighbouring odd mass nuclei e.g. the calculated
energy levels of J=0^+ states in ^{44}Ti are at twice the energies of
corresponding levels in ^{43}Ti(^{43}Sc) with J=j=7/2. Here an approximate
extension of the relationship is made by adopting a truncated seniority scheme
i.e. for ^{46}Ti and ^{45}Sc we get the relationship if we do not allow the
seniority v=4 states to mix with the v=0 and v=2 states. Better than that, we
get very close to the two to one relationship if seniority v=4 states are
admixed perturbatively. In addition, it is shown that the higher isospin states
do not contain seniority 4 admixtures.

reduce discrepancies among the recently reported values about the deuteron
binding energy and pin down the uncertainty due to the Doppler broadening of

the $\Sigma N$ relative momentum. The relation between the poles and the shape
of the $\Lambda N$ elastic total cross section is discussed based on a
so-called uniformization by which two-channel $t$-matrices become single-valued
on a complex valuable. We also find poles near the $\Lambda N$ threshold. These
are correlated to the $S$-wave $\Lambda N$ scattering lengths, the values of

frequency regimes: very high frequency, where the photon energy exceeds both,
the ionization potential of the outer {\em and} the inner electron, and an
intermediate frequency where, from a ``single active electron''-point of view
the outer electron is expected to stabilize but the inner one is not. Our
results reveal that correlation reduces stabilization when compared to results
from single active electron-calculations. However, despite this destabilizing
effect of electron correlation we still observe a decreasing ionization
probability within a certain intensity domain in the high-frequency case. We
compare our results from the fully correlated simulations with those from
simpler, approximate models. This is useful for future work on ``real''
more-than-one electron atoms, not yet accessible to numerical {\em ab initio}

developed. The aim in these papers is to present an explicit mathematical
formalism which constitutes a complete theory compatible with relativistic
quantum field theory. In this paper, which could also serve as an introduction
to the earlier papers, three issues are discussed. First, a significant, but
fairly straightforward, revision in some of the technical details is proposed.
This is used as an opportunity to introduce the formalism. Then the
probabilistic structure of the theory is revised, and it is proposed that the
experience of an individual observer can be modelled as the experience of
observing a particular, identified, discrete stochastic process. Finally, it is
argued that the formalism can be modified to give a physics in which no
constants are required. Instead, `constants' have to be determined by
observation, and are fixed only to the extent to which they have been observed.

linear multiport interferometer followed by a unique set of single mode
squeezers and then another multiport interferometer. Using this decomposition
we derive a no-go theorem for superpositions of macroscopically distinct states
from single-photon detection. Further, we demonstrate the equivalence between
several schemes for randomly creating polarization-entangled states. Finally,
we derive minimal quantum optical circuits for ideal quantum non-demolition
coupling of quadrature-phase amplitudes.
