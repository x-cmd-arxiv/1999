measured cosmic antiproton flux at low kinetic energies could be interpreted in
terms of a neutralino-induced component. An overproduction of low energy
antiprotons seems however to be disfavoured by recent data from the BESS
experiment. The strategy we propose here is to focus instead on the high energy
antiproton spectrum. We find cases in which the signal from neutralino
annihilations in a clumpy halo scenario can be unambiguously distinguished from
the cosmic ray induced component. Such signatures can be tested in the near
future by upcoming experiments. We investigate also the possibility that
antiprotons have a finite lifetime. We find cases in which the
neutralino-induced flux is consistent with present data for a lifetime as low
as 0.15 Myr, in clear violation of a recent bound derived from the antiproton
cosmic ray flux.

distinguishable from dwarfs selected as starbursting by other methods, such as
blue compact dwarfs and HII galaxies. All these classes exhibit exponential
surface brightness profiles in their outer regions but often have a central
blue excess. Typically, these starbursting ""cores"" are young (0.01 - 0.1 Gyr)
events compared to the older (1 - 10 Gyr) enveloping galaxy. The ratio of the
core-to-envelope blue fluxes ranges from essentially zero to about two. These
starbursts are therefore modest events involving only a few percent of the
stellar mass. The envelopes have surface-brightnesses that are much higher than
typical dwarf Irregular (dI) galaxies, so it is unlikely that there is a
straightforward evolutionary relation between typical dIs and dwarf starburst
galaxies. Instead BAGs may repeatedly cycle through starburst and quiescent
phases, corresponding to the galaxies with strong and weak/absent cores
respectively. Once BAGs use up the available gas (either through star-formation
or galactic winds) so that star-formation is shut off, the faded remnants would
strongly resemble dwarf elliptical (dE) galaxies. However, in the current
cosmological epoch this is a slow process that is the aftermath of a series of
many weak, recurring bursts. Present-day dEs must have experienced more rapid

  Dense, Jeans-unstable gas clumps collapse and form protostellar cores which
evolve through competitive accretion and $N$-body interactions with other

log-normal distribution which peaks approximately at the average Jeans mass of
the system. Scaled to physical conditions typical for star-forming molecular

deposition rate with source luminosity to estimate the ratio f of mass ejection

mechanism could operate across the entire luminosity range. However, we stress
that for the high-mass YSOs, the detailed physics of this mechanism and how the
ejected wind/jet entrains ambient material remain to be addressed. We also

The maps reveal the presence of HV bullets in both outflows with velocities
between 40-80kms-1 from the ambient gas velocity. The blue and redshifted CO HV
bullets associated with the IRc2 outflow are distributed in thin (12""-20"",
0.02-0.04pc) elliptical ring-like structures with a size of ~10""x50""
(0.02x0.1pc). The CO emission at the most extreme blue and redshifted

bullets.
  The low velocity H2O masers and the H2* bullets around IRc2 are located at
the inner edges of the ring of CO HV bullets and surrounding the EHV CO
emission. Furthermore, the high velocity H2O masers are very well correlated
with the EHV CO emission. This morphology is consistent with a model of a jet
driven molecular outflow oriented close to the line of sight.
  In the Orion-S outflow, the morphology of the CO HV bullets shows a bipolar
structure in the southeast-northwest direction, and the H2O masers are found
only at low velocities in the region between the exciting source and the CO HV
bullets.
  The morphology of the CO HV bullets, the radial velocities and the spatial

tau_100 excess, which are respectively the 100 mum intensity and 100 mum
optical depth in excess of what would be expected from HI emission. In two
observed regions, we were able to make a detailed comparison of the infrared
excess and the CO emission. We have found that tau_100 excess has a very good
correlation with the integrated intensity of CO emission, W_CO, but I_100
excess does not. There are two reasons for the poor correlation between I_100
excess and W_CO: firstly, there are regions with enhanced infrared emissivity
without CO, and secondly, dust grains associated with molecular gas have a low
infrared emissivity. In one region, these two factors completely hide the
presence of molecular gas in the infrared. In the second region, we could
identify the area with molecular gas, but I_100 excess significantly
underestimates the column density of molecular hydrogen because of the second
factor mentioned above. We therefore conclude that tau_100 excess, rather than
I_100 excess, is an accurate indicator of molecular content along the line of
sight. We derive tau_100/N(H)=(1.00+-0.02)*10^-5~(10^20 cm^-2)^-1, and
X=N(H_2)/W_CO=~0.7*10^20 cm^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1. Our results suggest that I_100

multiplied by a correction factor xi_c=<I_100/N(H)>_HI/<I_100/N(H)>_H_2 (~2 in

atomic and molecular gas. We also discuss some limitations of this work.

Navier-Stokes equations show that transverse velocity differences are described
by ``normal'' Kolmogorov scaling $<(\Delta v)^{2n}> \propto r^{2n/3}$ and obey
a gaussian statistics. Since the non-trivial scaling is a sign of a strong
non-linearity of the problem, these two results seem to contradict each other.
A theory, explaining this result is presented in this paper. Strong
time-dependence of the large-scale features of the flow ($\bar{u^2}\propto t$)
results in decoupling of the large-scale dynamics from statistically
steady-state small-scale random processes. This time-dependence is also a
reason for the localness of the pressure-gradient terms in the equations
governing the small-scale velocity difference PDF's. The derived
self-consistent expression for the pressure gradient contributions lead to the
conclusion that the small-scale transverse velocity differences are governed by
a linear Langevin-like equation, strirred by a non-local, universal,
solution-depending gaussian random force. This explains the experimentally
observed gaussian statistics of transverse velocity differences and their
Kolmogorov scaling. The solution for the PDF of longitudinal velocity
differences is based on a smallness of the energy flux in two-dimensional
turbulence. The theory makes a few quantitative predictions which can be tested
experimentally.

states in a neuronal network model that represents part of thalamic circuitry.
Our model neurons have a Hodgkin-Huxley-type low threshold Calcium channel,
display post inhibitory rebound, and are connected via GABAergic inhibitory
synapses. We find that there is a threshold in synaptic strength, $\tau_c$,
below which there are no stable spiking network states. Above threshold the
stable spiking state is a cluster state, where different groups of neurons fire
consecutively, and each neuron fires with the same cluster each time. Weak
noise destabilizes this state, but stronger noise drives the system into a
different, self-organized, stochastically synchronized state. Neuronal firing
is still organized in clusters, but individual neurons can hop from cluster to
cluster. Noise can actually induce and sustain such a state below the threshold
of synaptic strength. We do find a qualitative difference in the firing
patterns between small ($\sim 10$ neurons) and large ($\sim 1000$ neurons)
networks. We determine the information content of the spike trains in terms of
two separate contributions: the spike time jitter around cluster firing times,
and the hopping from cluster to cluster. We quantify the information loss due
to temporally correlated interspike intervals. Recent experiments on the locust

this for a two-dimensional system as a function of system size, shear rate,

box diagrams, the cross section is highly suppressed. Thus, photon-photon
scattering opens an interesting opportunity for studying the new gravity
interaction, which allows tree-level photon couplings. In addition, we also
examine the diphoton production at hadronic and $e^+ e^-$ colliders. We derive
the limits on the cut-off scale from the available diphoton data and also
estimate the sensitivity reach in Run II at the Tevaton and at the future
linear $e^+ e^-$ colliders.

We compute the number of moduli of $D$, namely $\dim H^1(D, T_D)$, to be $3g-4

moduli space of all such pairs $(X',D')$, namely $D'$ is a smooth anticanonical

an isomorphism. This is proved under the assumption that if $g =2$, then $n\neq

counter with a total area of $\sim 5000 cm^2$, the Gas Slit Camera (GSC), and
the other is an X-ray CCD array with a total area $\sim 200 cm^2$, the
Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC). The GSC subtends a field of view with an angular
dimension of 1$^\circ\times 180^\circ$ while the SSC subtends a field of view
with an angular dimension of 1$^\circ$ times a little less than 180$^\circ$. In
the course of one station orbit, MAXI can scan almost the entire sky with a
precision of 1$^\circ$ and with an X-ray energy range of 0.5-30 keV. We have
