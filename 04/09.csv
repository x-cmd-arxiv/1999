  Astrophysical Journal on April 8",,"10.1086/308438",,"astro-ph",,"  The discovery of nearly coherent brightness oscillations during thermonuclear
X-ray bursts from six neutron-star low-mass X-ray binaries has opened up a new
way to study the propagation of thermonuclear burning, and may ultimately lead
to greater understanding of thermonuclear propagation in other astrophysical
contexts, such as in Type Ia supernovae. Here we report detailed analyses of
the ~580 Hz brightness oscillations during bursts from 4U 1636-536. We
investigate the bursts as a whole and, in more detail, the initial portions of
the bursts. We analyze the ~580 Hz oscillations in the initial 0.75 seconds of
the five bursts that were used in a previous search for a brightness
oscillation at the expected ~290 Hz spin frequency, and find that if the same
frequency model describes all five bursts there is insufficient data to require
more than a constant frequency or, possibly, a frequency plus a frequency
derivative. Therefore, although it is appropriate to use an arbitrarily
complicated model of the ~580 Hz oscillations to generate a candidate waveform
for the ~290 Hz oscillations, models with more than two parameters are not
required by the data. For the bursts as a whole we show that the
characteristics of the brightness oscillations vary greatly from burst to
burst. We find, however, that in at least one of the bursts, and possibly in
three of the four that have strong brightness oscillations throughout the
burst, the oscillation frequency reaches a maximum several seconds into the
burst and then decreases. This behavior has not been reported previously for
burst brightness oscillations, and it poses a challenge to the standard burning
layer expansion explanation for the frequency changes.

  April 16, 1999. Fixed typos",,"10.1086/300937",,"astro-ph",,"  Recent LTE analyses (Israelian et al. 1998 and Bosegaard et al. 1999) of the
OH bands in the optical-ultraviolet spectra of nearby metal-poor subdwarfs
indicate that oxygen abundances are generally higher than those previously
determined. The difference increases with decreasing metallicity and reaches
delta([O/Fe]) ~ +0.6 dex as [Fe/H] approaches -3.0.
  Employing high resolution (R = 50000), high S/N (~ 250) echelle spectra of
the two stars found by Israelian et al. (1998) to have the highest
[O/Fe]-ratios, viz, BD +23 3130 and BD +37 1458, we conducted abundance
analyses based on about 60 Fe I and 7-9 Fe II lines. We determined from Kurucz
LTE models the values of the stellar parameters, as well as abundances of Na,
Ni, and the traditional alpha-elements, independent of the calibration of color
vs $T_{eff}$ scales. We determined oxygen abundances from spectral synthesis of
the stronger line (6300 A) of the [O I] doublet.
  The syntheses of the [O I] line lead to smaller values of [O/Fe], consistent
with those found earlier among halo field and globular cluster giants. We
obtain [O/Fe] = +0.35 +/- 0.2 for BD +23 3130 and +0.50 +/- 0.2 for BD +37
1458. In the former, the [O I] line is very weak (~ 1 mA), so that the quoted
[O/Fe] value may in reality be an upper limit.
  Therefore in these two stars a discrepancy exists between the [O/Fe]- ratios
derived from [O I] and the OH feature, and the origin of this difference
remains unclear. Until the matter is clarified, we suggest it is premature to
conclude that the ab initio oxygen abundances of old, metal-poor stars need to
be revised drastically upward.

probably avoided in any binary in which a main-sequence donor transfers mass on
a thermal timescale to a neutron star or black hole, even though the mass
transfer rate may reach values of 0.001 solar masses per year. This conclusion
probably applies also to donors expanding across the Hertzsprung gap, provided
that their envelopes are radiative. SS433 may be an example of a system in this

star (neutron star, white dwarf or T Tauri star) is subjected to magnetic
torques which induce warping and precession of the disk. The origin of these
torques lies in the interaction between the (induced) surface current on the
disk and the horizontal magnetic field (parallel to the disk) produced by the
inclined magnetic dipole. Under quite general conditions, there exists a
magnetic warping instability in which the magnetic torque drives the disk plane
away from the equatorial plane of the star toward a state where the disk normal
vector is perpendicular to the spin axis. Viscous stress tends to suppress the
warping instability at large radii, but the magnetic torque always dominates as
the disk approaches the magnetosphere boundary. The magnetic torque also drives
the tilted inner disk into retrograde precession around the stellar spin axis.
Moreover, resonant magnetic forcing on the disk can occur which may affect the
dynamics of the disk. The magnetically driven warping instability and
precession may be related to a number observational puzzles, including: (1)
Spin evolution (torque reversal) of accreting X-ray pulsars; (2) Quasi-periodic
oscillations in low-mass X-ray binaries; (3) Super-orbital periods in X-ray

neutron stars in these systems have masses $\go 2~M_\odot$, considerably larger
than any well-measured neutron star mass. We suggest that the levelling off of
$\nu_{QPO}$ may be also understood in terms of a steepening magnetic field
which, although possibly dipolar at the stellar surface, is altered
substantially by disk accretion, and presents a ``wall'' to the accretion flow
that may be outside the innermost stable orbit. General relativistic effects
add to the flattening of the $\nu_{QPO}-\mdot$ relation at frequencies below
the Kepler frequency at the innermost stable orbit. We offer two other possible
ways to reconcile the low value of $\nu_{max}$ ($\approx 1060$ Hz for 4U
1820-30) with a moderate neutron star mass, $\approx 1.4\msun$: at sufficiently
large $\mdot$, either (i) the disk terminates in a very thin boundary layer
near the neutron star surface, or (ii) $\nu_{QPO}$ is not the orbital frequency
right at the inner edge of the disk, but rather at a somewhat larger radius,

the distribution of band gaps significantly influences the optical absorption.

infalling particle (described by a quantized field) and the radiation field.
These fields are coupled by current-current interactions and propagate in the
Schwarzschild geometry. As long as the photons energy is much smaller than the
mass of the infalling particle, one recovers Hawking radiation since our
S-matrix elements identically reproduce the Bogoliubov coefficients obtained by
treating the trajectory of the infalling particle classically. But after a
brief period, the energy of the `partners' of Hawking photons reaches this mass
and the production of thermal photons through these interactions stops. The
implications of this result are discussed.

These can be made manifest by lifting 11D M-theory to the formalism of two-time
physics in 13D by adding gauge degrees of freedom. We illustrate this idea by
constructing a toy M-model on the worldline in 13D with manifest OSp(1/64)
global supersymmetry, and a number of new local symmetries that remove ghosts.
Some of the local symmetries are bosonic cousins of kappa supersymmetries. The

gauge symmetries can be fixed in various ways to come down to a one time

group (up to Wilson lines and/or moving of branes) and ii) are equivalent to

anomaly cancellation conditions and qualify both statements. In general the
tadpole cancellation conditions imply gauge anomaly cancellation but are
stronger than the latter conditions in D=4, N=1 orientifolds. We also find that
tadpole cancellation conditions in Z_N D=4,6 compact orientifolds do not
completely fix the gauge group and we provide new solutions different from

eigenvectors (kets) of self-adjoint Hamiltonians with complex eigenvalues. Like
the Dirac kets, they are mathematically well defined in the Rigged Hilbert
Space. Gamow kets are derived from the resonance poles of the S-matrix. They
have a Breit-Wigner energy distribution, an exponential decay law, and are
members of a basis vector expansion whose truncation gives the finite
dimensional effective theories with a complex Hamiltonian matrix. They also
have an asymmetric time evolution described by a semigroup generated by the
Hamiltonian, which expresses a fundamental quantum mechanical arrow of time.
These Gamow kets are generalized to relativistic Gamow vectors by extrapolating
from the Galilei group to the Poincare group. This leads to semigroup
representations of the Poincare group which are characterized by spin j and
complex invariant mass square. In these non-unitary representations the Lorentz
subgroup is unitarily represented and the four-momenta are ""minimally complex""
in the sense that the four-velocity is real. The relativistic Gamow vectors
have all the properties listed above for the non-relativistic Gamow vectors and
are therefore ideally suited to describe relativistic resonances and
quasistable particles.

high-curvature initial phase, down to a low-curvature phase and can exit
inflation to end up being radiation-dominated, in a naturally graceful manner.

ways of reconciling the string dilaton with inflation.

technique for secure key distribution with single-photon transmissions:
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle ensures that an adversary can neither
successfully tap the key transmissions, nor evade detection (eavesdropping
raises the key error rate above a threshold value). We have developed
experimental quantum cryptography systems based on the transmission of
non-orthogonal photon states to generate shared key material over
multi-kilometer optical fiber paths and over line-of-sight links. In both
cases, key material is built up using the transmission of a single-photon per
bit of an initial secret random sequence. A quantum-mechanically random subset
of this sequence is identified, becoming the key material after a data
reconciliation stage with the sender. Here we report the most recent results of
