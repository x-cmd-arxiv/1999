temperature fluctuations. Since there are both potentially observable
quantities in a microwave background map, there are no adjustable parameters in
the predictions. These correlations should therefore provide a powerful test of
the gaussian hypothesis, and provide a useful discriminant between inflation
and topological defect models such as the cosmic string model. The correlations
have a number of oscillatory features, which should be detectable at high

mass central engines only if the ejecta are beamed. As was pointed out by
Rhoads, the dynamics of the blast wave, formed by the beamed ejecta sweeping
the external gas, can be significantly modified by the sideways expansion. This
is because in this case the surface of the blast wave increases faster than
just due to the radial divergence and so the blast wave deceleration rate
increases faster. According to analytical estimates, the effect becomes
important shortly after the bulk Lorentz factor of the blast wave drops below
the inverse of the initial opening angle of the beamed ejecta and is
accompanied by a sharp break in the afterglow light curve.
  However, our numerical studies, which follow the dynamical evolution of the
blast wave, the evolution of the electron energy distribution, and take into
account the light travel effects related to the lateral size of the source,
show that the break of the light curve is weaker and much smoother than the one
analytically predicted. A prominent break emerges only for a model without

(astro-ph/9812133 and astro-ph/9805201). I discuss reasons why this particular
combination of tests is important and how the constraints can be improved in
the future. The lensing statistics and supernova results are not inconsistent,
thus it is meaningful to determine joint constraints on lambda_0 and Omega_0 by
combining the results from both tests. The quantity measured by the lens
statistics and the m-z relation for type Ia supernovae discussed here is
approximately lambda_0 - Omega_0. At 95% confidence, the upper limit on
lambda_0 - Omega_0 from lensing statistics alone is 0.45 and from supernovae
alone is in the range 0.65--0.81 (depending on the data set). For joint
constraints, the upper limit on lambda_0 - Omega_0 is in the range 0.55--0.60
(again depending on the data set). For a flat universe with lambda_0 + Omega_0
= 1, this corresponds to upper limits on lambda_0, taking the top of the range
from different data sets, of 0.72, 0.90 and 0.80 for lensing statistics alone,
supernovae alone and the joint analysis, respectively. This is perfectly
consistent with the current `standard cosmological model' with lambda_0
approximately 0.7 and Omega_0 approximately 0.3 and is consistent with a flat
universe but, neglecting other cosmological tests, does not require it.

correlations function is measured in redshift space, as a function of angular
separation and velocity difference. The relation between angle and velocity
difference depends on the cosmological model through the factor H(z)D(z), where
H(z) is the Hubble parameter and D(z) is the angular diameter distance.
Therefore, the cosmological model can be constrained by measuring this factor
from the shape of the contours of the redshift space correlation function, if
the effect of peculiar velocities can be taken into account. Here, we
investigate this method applied to the high redshift Lyman-break galaxies. The
high bias factor of this galaxy population should suppress peculiar velocity
effects, leaving the cosmological distortion as the main contribution to the
anisotropy of the correlation function. We estimate the shot noise and cosmic
variance errors using linear theory. A field size of at least 0.2 square
degrees is required to distinguish the Einstein-de Sitter model from the flat
Lambda=0.7 model, if 1.25 Lyman-break galaxies are measured per square arc
minute. With a field of 1 square degrees, the cosmological constant can be
measured to 20 % accuracy if it is large (> 0.5). Other equations of state for

physics responsible for the continuum emission, its point of origin, how
nuclear activity is fueled, and how supermassive black holes evolve. The key to
finding answers to these questions lies in measuring the intrinsic luminosities
and spectral shapes, the relation of these properties to other wavebands, and
how the source properties change with redshift. This article reviews X-ray
observations of AGN from redshifts of ~0.1-3 with the goal of summarizing our
current knowledge of their X-ray spectral characteristics. Results are
evaluated in terms of their robustness and are examined in the light of current
theoretical predictions of energy release via processes associated with the

the importance of AGN studies at high redshift as they relate to the total
energetics of the Universe.

a charge transfer excitation. The system is modelled by three electron levels,
one core level and two outer levels. The model has a Coulomb interaction
between these levels and the continuum states into which the core electron is
emitted. The model is simple enough to allow an exact numerical solution, and
with a separable potential an analytic solution. We calculate the ratio
r(omega) between the weights of the satellite and the main peak as a function
of the photon energy omega. The transition from the adiabatic to the sudden
limit takes place for quite small photoelectron kinetic energies. For such
small energies, the variation of the dipole matrix element is substantial and
described by the energy scale Ed. Without the coupling to the photoelectron,
the corresponding ratio r0(omega) is determined by Ed and the satellite
excitation energy dE. When the interaction potential with the continuum states
is introduced, a new energy scale Es=1/(2Rs^2) enters, where Rs is a length
scale of the interaction potential. At threshold there is typically a (weak)
constructive interference between intrinsic and extrinsic contributions, and
the ratio r(omega)/r0(omega) is larger than its limiting value for large omega.
The interference becomes small or weakly destructive for photoelectron energies
of the order Es. For larger energies r(omega)/r0(omega) therefore typically has
a weak undershoot. If this undershoot is neglected, r(omega)/r0(omega) reaches
its limiting value on the energy scale Es.

significant for narrow defects; maximum reflection (plasmon mirrors) is
achieved for a~lambda/10. For increasing defect widths, protuberances and
indentations behave differently. The former give rise to a monotonic increase
of radiation at the expense of SPP transmission for increasing defect
half-width. Indentations exhibit a significant increase of radiation (decrease
of SPP transmission) for half-widths of the order of or smaller than the

further increasing the half-width. Light-emitters might thus be associated with
either wide indentations, or protuberances with widths that are of the order of

integrated contributions that have been subtracted. The method is a
generalization of the dipole formalism of Catani and Seymour, which was
formulated for NLO QCD processes with massless unpolarized particles. The
presented formalism allows for arbitrary mass and helicity configurations in
processes with charged fermions and any other neutral particles. Particular
attention is paid to the limit of small fermion masses, in which collinear
singularities cause potentially large corrections. The actual application and
the efficiency of the formalism are demonstrated by the discussion of photonic
corrections to the processes \gamma \gamma --> t \bar t (\gamma), e^- \gamma

R is a distance from the fireball, is bounded from above by n_\pi(t,R)\le

study the effect of nonlinear dispersion. Using simple scaling arguments we
show, how, instead of the conventional solitary waves like solitons, the
interaction of the nonlinear dispersion with nonlinear convection generates
compactons - the compact solitary waves free of exponential tails. This
interaction also generates many other solitary wave structures like cuspons,
peakons, tipons etc. which are otherwise unattainable with linear dispersion.
Various self similar solutions of these higher order nonlinear dispersive
equations are also obtained using similarity transformations. Further, it is
shown that, like the third-order nonlinear $K(m,n)$ equations, the fifth-order
nonlinear dispersive equations also have the same four conserved quantities and
further even any arbitrary odd order nonlinear dispersive $K(m,n,p...)$ type
equations also have the same three (and most likely the four) conserved
quantities. Finally, the stability of the compacton solutions for the
fifth-order nonlinear dispersive equations are studied using linear stability
analysis. From the results of the linear stability analysis it follows that,
unlike solitons, all the allowed compacton solutions are stable, since the
stability conditions are satisfied for arbitrary values of the nonlinear

  claimed proof in the paper. It is just a bad intuition",,,,"quant-ph",,"  In coin tossing two remote participants want to share a uniformly distributed
random bit. At the least in the quantum version, each participant test whether
or not the other has attempted to create a bias on this bit. It is requested
that, for b = 0,1, the probability that Alice gets bit b and pass the test is
smaller than 1/2 whatever she does, and similarly for Bob. If the bound 1/2
holds perfectly against any of the two participants, the task realised is
called an exact coin tossing. If the bound is actually $1/2 + \xi$ where the
bias $\xi$ vanishes when a security parameter m defined by the protocol
increases, the task realised is a (non exact) coin tossing. It is found here
that exact coin tossing is impossible. At the same time, an unconditionally
secure quantum protocol that realises a (non exact) coin tossing is proposed.
The protocol executes m biased quantum coin tossing procedures at the same
time. It executes the first round in each of these m procedures sequentially,
then the second rounds are executed, and so on until the end of the n
procedures. Each procedure requires 4n particles where $n \in O(\lg m)$. The
final bit x is the parity of the m random bits. The information about each of
these m bits is announced a little bit at a time which implies that the
principle used against bit commitment does not apply. The bias on x is smaller
than $1/m$. The result is discussed in the light of the impossibility result
for exact coin tossing.

  Journal of Physics A",,,,"quant-ph cs.CC",,"  We compare classical and quantum query complexities of total Boolean
functions. It is known that for worst-case complexity, the gap between quantum
and classical can be at most polynomial. We show that for average-case
complexity under the uniform distribution, quantum algorithms can be
exponentially faster than classical algorithms. Under non-uniform distributions
the gap can even be super-exponential. We also prove some general bounds for
average-case complexity and show that the average-case quantum complexity of
MAJORITY under the uniform distribution is nearly quadratically better than the
classical complexity.
