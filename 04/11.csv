  in Astronomy & Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph",,"  We present a detailed period analysis for 93 red semiregular variables by
means of Fourier and wavelet analyses of long-term visual observations carried
out by amateur astronomers. The results of this analysis yield insights into
the mode structure of semiregular variables and help to clarify the
relationship between them and Mira variables. After collecting all available
data from various international databases (AFOEV, VSOLJ, HAA/VSS and AAVSO) we
test the accuracy and reliability of data. We compare the averaged and
noise-filtered visual light curves with simultaneous photoelectric
V-measurements, the effect of the length versus the relatively low
signal-to-noise ratio is illustrated by period analysis of artificial data,
while binning effects are tested by comparing results of frequency analyses of
the unbinned and averaged light curves.
  The distribution of periods and period ratios is examined through the use of
the (log P_0, log P_1) and (log P_1, log P_0/P_1) plots. Three significant and
two less obvious sequences are present which could be explained as the direct
consequence of different pulsational modes. This hypothesis is supported by the
results for multiperiodic variables with three periods. Finally, these space
methods are illustrated by several interesting case studies that show the best
examples of different special phenomena such as long-term amplitude modulation,
amplitude decrease and mode switching.

Josephson-junction array. Breathers exist under a range of dc current biases
and temperatures, and are detected by measuring dc voltages. We find the
maximum allowable bias current for the breather is proportional to the array
depinning current while the minimum current seems to be related to a junction
retrapping mechanism. We have observed that this latter instability leads to
the formation of multi-site breather states in the array. We have also studied
the domain of existence of the breather at different values of the array
parameters by varying the temperature.

experimental results, transport data near quantum Hall transitions are
interpreted by identifying two distinct conduction regimes. The ``classical''
regime, dominated by nearest neighbor hopping between localized conducting
puddles, manifests an activated-like resistivity formula, and the quantized
Hall insulator behavior. At very low temperatures $T$, or farther from the
critical point, a crossover occurs to a ""quantum"" transport regime dominated by
variable range hopping. The latter is characterized by a different
T-dependence, yet the dependence on filling fraction is, coincidentally, hard
to distinguish.

prediction for the Higgs mass window (defined by upper (perturbativity) and
lower (stability) bounds) can be substantially affected. Actually the Higgs
mass window can close completely, which settles an upper bound on the Majorana
mass for the right-handed neutrinos, $M$, ranging from $10^{13}$ GeV for three
generations of quasi-degenerate massive neutrinos with $m_\nu\simeq 2 $ eV, to
$5\times 10^{14}$ GeV for just one relevant generation with $m_\nu\simeq 0.1 $
eV. A slightly weaker upper bound on $M$, coming from the requirement that the
neutrino Yukawa couplings do not develop a Landau pole, is also discussed.

quantization of the free massive Dirac fermions in one Rindler wedge we
identify this quantization with a representation of the infinite-dimensional
algebra introduced in the paper q-alg/9702002 and specialized to the free

placing the drive material inside its own warp field (making the drive system
part of the payload), but we then have to deal with Low's related objection,
that there is then a restricted rate at which this ""naked"" warp-field can
propagate through the background metric. We argue that the propagation of this
sort of gravitational wave is not a trivial problem, and that the possibility
of ultrafast warpfield propagation should not be dismissed without further
research.
