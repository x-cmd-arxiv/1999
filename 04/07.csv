which accounts for nearly 50% of the nuclear flux at K-band. This region
extends 10 pc on either side of an unresolved point source nucleus which is at
most, 0.''02 or 1.4 pc in size. Both the point source and the newly imaged
extended emission are very red, with identical H-K colors corresponding to a
color temperature of 800 K. While the point source is of a size to be
consistent with grains in thermal equilibrium with the nuclear source, the
extended emission is not. It must consist either of nuclear emission which has
been reflected off an extended dusty disk or of small grains raised to

expansion velocity: ~45 km/s, mass: ~8*10^6 SM). It is seen in the 12CO(J=1-0),
12CO(J=2-1), 13CO(J=1-0) and C18O(J=1-0) lines. The superbubble is centred
around the most powerful supernova remnant in M82, 41.9+58. The CO observations
show that the molecular superbubble already broke out of the disk. This
scenario is supported by ROSAT HRI observations which suggest that hot coronal
gas originating from inside the shell is the main contributor to the diffuse
X-ray outflow in M82. We briefly discuss observations of the same region at
other wavelengths (radio continuum, optical, HI, X-rays, ionized gas). From our
spectral line observations, we derive a kinematic age of about 10^6 years for
the superbubble. Using simple theoretical models, the total energy needed for
the creation of this superbubble is of order 2*10^{54} ergs. The required
energy input rate (0.001 SN yr^{-1}) is reasonable given the high supernova
(SN) rate of ~0.1 SN yr^{-1} in the central part of M82. As much as 10% of the
energy needed to create the superbubble is still present in form of the kinetic
energy of the expanding molecular shell. Of order 10% is conserved in the hot
X-ray emitting gas emerging from the superbubble into the halo of M82. This
newly detected expanding molecular superbubble is believed to be powered by the
same objects that also lie at the origin of the prominent X-ray outflow in M82.
It can therefore be used as an alternative tool to investigate the physical
properties of these sources.

An open system by itself is thus not conservative. As a result, the
time-evolution operator is not hermitian in the usual sense and the
eigenfunctions (factorized solutions in space and time) are no longer normal
modes but quasinormal modes (QNMs) whose frequencies $\omega$ are complex. QNM
analysis has been a powerful tool for investigating open systems. Previous
studies have been mostly system specific, and use a few QNMs to provide
approximate descriptions. Here we review recent developments which aim at a
unifying treatment. The formulation leads to a mathematical structure in close
analogy to that in conservative, hermitian systems. Many of the mathematical
tools for the latter can hence be transcribed. Emphasis is placed on those
cases in which the QNMs form a complete set for outgoing wavefunctions, so that
in principle all the QNMs together give an exact description of the dynamics.
Applications to optics in microspheres and to gravitational waves from black
holes are reviewed, and directions for further development are outlined.

parametrized using the fine structure constant. It is suggested that the new

dominance also for the so-called spatial string tension, the present analysis
focuses on the global topology of vortex networks. General arguments are given
supporting the notion that the deconfinement transition in the center vortex
picture takes the guise of a percolation transition. This transition is
detected in Monte Carlo experiments by concentrating on various slices through
the closed vortex surfaces; these slices, representing loops in lattice
universes reduced by one dimension, clearly exhibit the expected transition
from a percolating to a non-percolating, deconfined, phase. The latter phase
contains a large proportion of vortex loops winding around the lattice in the
Euclidean time direction. At the same time, an intuitive picture clarifying the
persistence of the spatial string tension in the deconfined phase emerges.

symmetry is in the bulk. After including several vector-like fields in the
bulk, and allowing the most general interactions with their natural strength
(including the higher dimensional ones which may be generated by gravity) which
are consistent with the geometry, a realistic pattern of the Standard Model
fermion masses and mixings can be naturally obtained without any flavor
symmetry. Neutrino masses and mixings required for the solar and atmospheric
neutrino problems can also be accommodated. The geometry of extra dimensions
and branes provides another way to realize the absence of certain interactions

of infrared cut-offs there is only a trivial infrared fixed-point structure in
the theory. However, the presence of masses, for either fermions or photons,
changes the situation drastically, leading to a mass-dependent non-trivial
infrared fixed point. In this picture a dynamical mass for the fermions is
found to be generated consistently. The non-linearity of the equations gives
rise to highly non-trivial constraints among the mass and effective (`running')
gauge coupling, which impose lower and upper bounds on the latter for dynamical
mass generation to occur. Possible implications of this to the theory of
high-temperature superconductivity are briefly discussed.

Gimon-Polchinski orientifold. We discuss the deformations of the IIA and IIB
constructions and describe a new supersymmetric configuration with curving
D6-branes. Starting from the IIB description we find the supergravity dual of
the large N field theory and discuss the matching of operators and KK states.
The matching of non-chiral primaries exhibits some interesting new features. We
also discuss a relevant deformation of the field theory under which it flows to
a line of strongly coupled N=1 fixed points in the infrared. For these fixed
points we find a partial supergravity description.

of the Klein-Gordon-like equations is usually treated as a structureless
point-like particle. A richer dynamics is unveiled when the extended character
of the soliton is taken into account. We show that interesting spatiotemporal
phenomena appear when the structure of the soliton interacts with finite-width
inhomogeneities. We solve an inverse problem in order to have external
perturbations which are generic and topologically equivalent to well-known
bifurcation models and such that the stability problem can be solved exactly.
We also show the different quasiperiodic and chaotic motions the soliton
undergoes as a time-dependent force pumps energy into the traslational mode of
the kink and relate these dynamics with the excitation of the shape modes of
the soliton.

velocity passes over the Alfven velocity, is computed in a magnetohydrodynamic
approximation. The analytical theory suggests that an infinitesimal
perturbation of a TASW results in its disintegration, i.e., finite variation of
the flow, or transformation into some other unsteady configuration. In the
present paper, this result is confirmed by numerical simulations. It is shown
that the disintegration time is close to its minimum value equal to the shock
thickness divided by a relative velocity of the emerging secondary structures.
The secondary TASW that appears after the disintegration is again unstable with
respect to disintegration. When the perturbation has a cyclic nature, the TASW
undergoes oscillatory disintegration, during which it repeatedly transforms
into another TASW. This process manifests itself as a train of shock and
rarefaction waves, which consecutively emerge at one edge of the train and
merge at the other edge.

classical capacity of a noiseless quantum channel, can increase the classical
capacity of some noisy quantum channels by an arbitrarily large constant factor
depending on the channel, relative to the best known classical capacity
achievable without entanglement. The enhancement factor is greatest for very
noisy channels, with positive classical capacity but zero quantum capacity.
Although such quantum channels can be simulated classically, no violation of
causality is implied, because the simulation requires at least as much forward
classical communication as the entanglement-assisted classical capacity of the
channel being simulated. We obtain exact expressions for the
entanglement-assisted capacity of depolarizing and erasure channels in d
dimensions.

yields a product expansion for the evolution operator of a general (possibly
non-Hermitian) Hamiltonian. For a class of such Hamiltonians this expansion
involves a finite number of terms, and our method gives the exact solution of
the corresponding time-dependent Schroedinger equation. We apply this method to
study the dynamics of a general nondegenerate two-level quantum system, a
time-dependent classical harmonic oscillator, and a degenerate system
consisting of a spin 1 particle interacting with a time-dependent electric
field E(t) through the Stark Hamiltonian H=\lambda [J.E(t)]^2.

formalism and displacement operator formalism of the negative binomial states
are found and the algebra involved turns out to be the SU(1,1) Lie algebra via
the generalized Holstein-Primarkoff realization. These states are essentially
Peremolov's SU(1,1) coherent states. We reveal their connection with the
geometric states and find that they are excited geometric states. As
intermediate states, they interpolate between the number states and geometric
states. We also point out that they can be recognized as the nonlinear coherent
states. Their nonclassical properties, such as sub-Poissonian distribution and
squeezing effect are discussed. The quasiprobability distributions in phase
space, namely the Q and Wigner functions, are studied in detail. We also
propose two methods of generation of the negative binomial states.
