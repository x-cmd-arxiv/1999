perturbations (scalars) - detailed fits to current observations indicate a
tensor-to-scalar quadrupole ratio of T/S < 0.5 for the simplest models; and on
the theoretical side the best-motivated inflationary models seem to require

is revised based on real fluid behavior and turbulent mixing theory. Gibson's
1996-1998 theory balances fluid mechanical forces with gravitational forces and
density diffusivity with gravitational diffusivity at critical viscous,
turbulent, magnetic, and diffusion length scales termed Schwarz scales L_SX.
Condensation and void formation occurs on non-acoustic density nuclei produced
by turbulent mixing for scales L>=L_SXmax rather than on sound wave crests and
troughs for L>=L_J as required by Jeans's 1902 linear acoustic theory. Schwarz
scales L_SX = L_SV, L_ST, L_SM, or L_SD may be smaller or larger than Jeans's
scale L_J. Thus, a very different ""nonlinear"" cosmology emerges to replace the
currently accepted ""linear"" cosmology. According to the new theory, most of the
inner halo dark matter of galaxies consists of planetary mass objects that
formed soon after the plasma to neutral gas transition 300,000 years after the
Big Bang. These objects are termed primordial fog particles (PFPs) and provide
an explanation for Schild's 1996 ""rogue planets ... likely to be the missing
mass"" of his observed quasar-lens galaxy, inferred from the twinkling
frequencies of both quasar images and their phased difference.

As well as the familiar growing and decaying adiabatic modes and the baryonic

which do not seem to have been discussed before. In the first, the ratio of
neutrinos to photons varies spatially but the net density perturbation
vanishes. In the second the photon-baryon plasma and the neutrino fluid have a
spatially varying relative bulk velocity, balanced so that the net momentum
density vanishes. Possible mechanisms which could generate the two neutrino
isocurvature modes are discussed. If one allows the most general regular
primordial perturbation, all quadratic correlators of observables such as the
microwave background anisotropy and matter perturbations are completely
determined by a $5\times 5,$ real, symmetric matrix-valued function of
co-moving wavenumber. In a companion paper we examine prospects for detecting

electrons occurs directly through the hopping term as the system tries to
recover the kinetic energy lost in forming the ""spins"" (magnetic moments).
Recombination is strong enough in 2-D to (1) destroys long-range magnetic order
and (2) restores the large Fermi surface. But the normal state remains
incoherent, characterize by a Fermi liquid of holons and bosonic spinons which
are paired into singlets. The singlets evolve out of half-filling and are
responsible for the spin-gap behavior. They induce a pairing of holons and bind
with the latter (to recover additional kinetic energy). In this paper we show
that $d_{x^2-y^2}$ symmetry of the order parameter and the shape of the T_c vs
doping curve, observed in cuprate superconductors, emerge naturally as a
consequence of the symmetry of the spinon pairs. The latter symmetry (p-wave),

precision whereas the trial-subspace vectors corresponding to these eigenvalues
approximate, in general, the exact eigenstates of H with much less accuracy.
Accordingly, various measures for the accuracy of the approximate eigenstates
derived by variational techniques are scrutinized. In particular, the matrix
elements of the commutator of the operator H and (suitably chosen) different
operators with respect to degenerate approximate eigenstates of H obtained by
variational methods are proposed as new criteria for the accuracy of

that there are two distinct classes of solutions: static spacetimes
generalising the Kaluza-Klein monopole, and non-static spacetimes generalising
the supersymmetric wave. The classification can be further refined by the
holonomy group of the spacetime. The static solutions are organised according
to the holonomy group of the spacelike hypersurface, whereas the non-static
solutions are similarly organised by the (lorentzian) holonomy group of the
spacetime. These are subgroups of the Lorentz group which act reducibly yet
indecomposably on Minkowski spacetime. We present novel constructions of
non-static vacua consisting of warped products of d-dimensional pp-waves with
(11-d)-dimensional manifolds admitting covariantly constant spinors. Our
construction yields local metrics with a variety of exotic lorentzian holonomy
groups. In the process, we write down the most general local metric in d<6
dimensions describing a pp-wave admitting a covariantly constant spinor.
Finally, we also discuss a particular class of supersymmetric vacua with
nonzero four-form obtained from the previous ones without modifying the
holonomy of the metric. This is possible because in a lorentzian spacetime a
metric which admits parallel spinors is not necessarily Ricci-flat, hence
supersymmetric backgrounds need not satisfy the equations of motion.

theories and general relativity are known to share some mathematical
similarities, and this connection can be used to find solutions to one theory
using known solutions of the other theory. For example, the Schwarzschild
solutions of general relativity can be shown to have a mathematically similar
counterpart in Yang-Mills theory. In this article we will discuss several
solutions to the Yang-Mills equations which can be found using this connection
between general relativity and Yang-Mills theory. Some comments about the
possible physical meaning of these solutions will be discussed. In particular
it will be argued that some of these analog solutions of Yang-Mills theory may
have some connection with the confinement phenomenon. To this end we will
briefly look at the motion of test particles moving in the background potential

with A by changing the position of the cross-over point x_3 in which r^A(x) =
1, unlike the pattern for nuclei with masses A larger than 4, where only the
amplitude of the oscillation changes. In particular we find that the pattern of
F_2(x) modifications is controlled with the values (1 - x_3) = 0.32 (D/N), 0.16
(3He/D) and 0.08 (4He/D). The obtained results follow from the relativistic
consideration of the nuclear structure and allow us to define a whole class of

laws of motion and Newton's universal law of gravity. We apply Electro-Magnetic
Quantum Gravity or EMQG to investigate Newtonian classical physics. EQMG is a
quantum gravity theory that is manifestly compatible with Cellular Automata
(CA) theory, a new paradigm for physical reality. EMQG is also based on a
theory of inertia proposed by R. Haisch, A. Rueda, and H. Puthoff, which we
modified and called Quantum Inertia (QI). Quantum Inertia theory states that in
Newton's 2nd law of motion (F=MA), inertia is caused by the strictly local
electrical force interactions bewteen matter (ultimately composed of
electrically charged quantum particles) and the surrounding electrically
charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. When an electrically charged
particle is accelerated, an electrical force results between the particle and
the surrounding electrically charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum
appears in a direction to oppose the acceleration. The sum of all the tiny
electrical forces originating between each charged particle and the surrounding
quantum vacuum, is the source of the total inertial force of a mass which
opposes accelerated motion in Newton's F = MA. Quantum Inertia theory resolves
the problems and paradoxes of accelerated motion introduced in Mach's principle
by suggesting that the state of acceleration of the charged virtual particles
of the quantum vacuum with respect to a mass, serves the function of Newton's
absolute space for accelerated masses only.
