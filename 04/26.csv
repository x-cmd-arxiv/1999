Cepheid-calibrated type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and those of a larger, more

possible in order to avoid systematic effects. A simultaneous $\chi ^2$
minimization yields a standardized absolute luminosity of the
Cepheid-calibrated supernovae as well as the Hubble constant obtained from the
more distant sample. We find $H_0 = 62 km/s Mpc^{-1}$ and a standardized
absolute magnitude of -19.46. The sensitivity of $H_0$ to a metallicity

have relied on an assumed transverse velocity for the lensing galaxy. Since the
measured mass scales with the square of the transverse velocity, published mass
limits are quite uncertain. In the case of Q2237+0305 we have properly
constrained this uncertainty. The distribution of light curve derivatives
allows quantitative treatment of the relative rates of microlensing due to
proper motions of microlenses, the orbital stream motion of microlenses and the
bulk galactic transverse velocity. By demanding that the microlensing rate due

determine lower limits for the average mass of stars and compact objects in the

anisotropies into the SO(5)-space and determine whether it is favorable for the

that Zhang's derivation of the effective interaction V_{eff} based on his

introduced several pages after this 'derivation' give the key to an effective
interaction very similar to that given by Zhang. It is shown that the

the largest possible eigenvalues of the operators under consideration

space. The corresponding flows are the monodromy preserving equations such as
the Schlesinger equations, the Painleve VI equation and their generalizations.
The equations corresponding to the highest integrals are monodromy preserving

in Bose-Einstein correlations (BEC) as a signature for the possible formation
of a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. In
particular, they suggested to measure the ratio of the transversal
interferometry radii, $R_{out}/R_{side}$, which can be obtained by fitting
experimental BEC data with a parametrization introduced by G. Bertsch et al. in
1988. The transverse radius parameter $R_{out}$ has compared to the transverse
radius parameter $R_{side}$ an additional temporal dependence which should be
sensitive to a prolonged lifetime of a fireball, in case a QGP was formed in a
relativistic heavy-ion collision. In my presentation, I am going to revisit the
above made considerations by addressing various possible scenarios for hadron
spectra (single and double inclusives) for Pb+Pb collisions at CERN/SPS beam
energies and for Au+Au collisions at BNL/RHIC beam energies, respectively,
within a relativistic {\it true} hydrodynamic framework (i.e., HYLANDER-C). I
claim, that the time-delay signal in Bose-Einstein correlations {\it is not} a
signature for the possible formation of a QGP, and I am going to explain why
this is the case.

  oscillator model","19 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1007/s100510051011",,"physics.optics physics.atom-ph",,"  The nonlinear oscillator model is useful to basically understand the most
important properties of nonlinear optical processes. It has been shown to give
the correct asymptotic behaviour and to provide the general feature of harmonic
generation to all orders, in particular dispersion relations and sum rules. We
investigate the properties of Pump and Probe processes using this model, and
study those cases where general theorems based on the holomorphic character of
the Kubo response function cannot be applied. We show that it is possible to
derive new sum rules and new Kramers-Kronig relations for the two lowest
moments of the real and imaginary part of the third order susceptibility and
that new specific contributions become relevant as the intensity of the probe
increases. Since the analitic properties of the susceptibility functions depend
only upon the time causality of the system we are confident that these results
are not model depemdent and therefore have a general validity, provided one
substitutes to the equilibrium values of the potential derivatives the density
matrix expectation values of the corresponding operators.

"quant-ph/9904081","Ulrich Mohrhoff","Ulrich Mohrhoff","Quantum mechanics and elements of reality","24 pages, plain TeX",,,"SAAPS-99041","quant-ph",,"  It is widely accepted that a Born probability of 1 is sufficient for the
existence of a corresponding element of reality. Recently Vaidman has extended
this idea to the ABL probabilities of the time-symmetrized version of quantum
mechanics originated by Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz. Several authors have
objected to Vaidman's time-symmetrized elements of reality without casting
doubt on the widely accepted sufficiency condition for `ordinary' elements of
reality. In this paper I show that while the proper truth condition for a
quantum counterfactual is an ABL probability of 1, neither a Born probability
of 1 nor an ABL probability of 1 is sufficient for the existence of an element
of reality. The reason this is so is that the contingent properties of
quantum-mechanical systems are extrinsic. To obtain this result, I need to
discuss objective probabilities, retroactive causality, and the objectivity or
otherwise of the psychological arrow of time. One consequence of the extrinsic
nature of quantum-mechanical properties is that quantum mechanics presupposes
property-defining actual events (or states of affairs) and therefore cannot be
called upon to account for their occurrence (existence). Neither these events
nor the correlations between them are capable of explanation, the former
because they are causal primaries, the latter because they are fundamental:
there are no underlying causal processes. Causal connections are something we
project onto the statistical correlations, and this works only to the extent
that statistical variations can be ignored. There are nevertheless important
conclusions to be drawn from the quantum-mechanical correlations, such as the
spatial nonseparability of the world.

associated with this entropy along with its thermodynamic interpretation are
discussed in detail for the Einstein-Podolosky-Rosen pair of two spin-1/2
particles. Given the data on the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt observable,
the analytic expression is given for the inferred quantum entangled state. It
is shown that for q greater than unity, indicating the sub-additive feature of
the Tsalls entropy, the entangled region is small and enlarges as one goes into
super-additive regime where q is less than unity. It is also shown that quantum
entanglement can be quantified by the generalized Kullback-Leibler entropy.
