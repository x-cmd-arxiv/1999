Although the results obtained from the detailed analysis of individual sources
indicate some ``source-by-source'' differences, we show in the following that
all spectra are consistent, at least qualitatively, with what expected from a
``0th-order'' version of unified models. Indeed, a simple test on these data
indicates that these Seyfert 2 galaxies are on average intrinsically very
similar to Seyfert 1 galaxies (i.e., steep at E>10 keV) and that the main
difference can be ascribed to a different amount of absorbing matter along the
line of sight (i.e. different inclinations of our line of sight with respect to
a putative molecular torus or different thicknesses of the tori).

to be about 20 kpc, and the relationship flattens for the larger sources. The
sizes of the knots in the compact as well as the larger sources are consistent
with this trend. We discuss possible implications of these trends. We find that
the hotspot closer to the nucleus or core component tends to be more compact
for the most asymmetric objects where the ratio of separations of the hotspots
from the nucleus, r_d > 2. These highly asymmetric sources are invariably CSS
objects, and their location in the hotspot size ratio - separation ratio
diagram is possibly due to their evolution in an asymmetric environment. We
also suggest that some soures, especially of lower luminosity, exhibit an
asymmetry in the collimation of the oppositely-directed radio jets.

strength, nor evidence for a magnetar.

in general have dark matter core radii of the order ~ 35 h^-1 kpc, we find that
the cosmological mass density, Omega_m, is less than 0.56 at the 95%

potentials determined recently by detailed numerical inversions of strong and
weak lensing imaging data. If no core radius is present, the upper limit on

suppression of power at small scales and reduces the expected weak lensing
signal. The measurement of such a suppression in the weak lensing power
spectrum allows a direct measurement of the neutrino mass, in contrast to
various other experiments which only allow mass splittings between two neutrino
species. Making reasonable assumptions on the accuracy of cosmological
parameters, we suggest that a weak lensing survey of 100 sqr. degrees can be
easily used to detect neutrinos down to a mass limit of 3.5 eV at the 2 sigma
level. This limit is lower than current limits on neutrino mass, such as from
the Ly-alpha forest and SN1987A. An ultimate weak lensing survey of pi
steradians down to a magnitude limit of 25 can be used to detect neutrinos down
to a mass limit of 0.4 eV at the 2 sigma level, provided that other
cosmological parameters will be known to an accuracy expected from cosmic
microwave background spectrum using the MAP satellite. With improved parameters
estimated from the PLANCK satellite, the limit on neutrino mass from weak
lensing can be further lowered by another factor of 3 to 4. For much smaller
surveys (10 sqr. degrees) that are likely to be first available in the near

ignored when deriving conventional cosmological parameters such as the mass

luminosities like those expected for young Galactic globular clusters with ages
ranging from a few to several hundred Myr. On this basis, we identify at least
some fraction of the compact, bright blue objects in NGC 3256 as young globular
clusters. The young cluster system comprises 15-20% of the luminosity of the
galaxy in B and half that in I within the region studied, indicating a high
efficiency of cluster formation on a galaxy-wide scale. We find that the
intrinsic color distribution is broad, and there is no significant trend of
color with magnitude. The combination of the broad range of observed colors and
the lack of a trend of redder colors at fainter magnitudes can not be fit
solely by a broad age distribution and/or differential reddening, although the
latter is clearly present. The observations can be accounted for by either the
preferential depletion/destruction of lower mass clusters as they age, or a
very young age (<= 20 Myr) for the cluster population, comparable to or less
than the dynamical time of the region in which the clusters are observed. We
also find that the luminosity function of the young cluster system can be
roughly fit by a power-law with an exponent of -1.8, with tentative evidence
that it flattens at faint magnitudes. The clusters are compact in size, with
typical estimated half-light radii of 5-10 parsecs, but there is no obvious
cut-off for larger radii, and only a shallow trend of size with luminosity.

of the tropospheric parameters and models to an accuracy of a few percent. It
may be possible to perform an `empirically calibrated' radiometric phase

scaling arguments allow one to build a fully-specified model of the underlying
distribution of matter and to explore the effects of local bias in the regime
of strong clustering. Using a generating-function method developed by
Bernardeau & Schaeffer (1992), we show that hierarchical models lead one
directly to the conclusion that a local bias does not alter the shape of the
galaxy correlation function relative to the matter correlation function on
large scales. This provides an elegant extension of a result first obtained by
Coles (1993) for Gaussian underlying fields and confirms the conclusions of
Scherrer & Weinberg (1998) obtained using a different approach. We also argue
that particularly dense regions in a hierarchical density field display a form
of bias that is different from that obtained by selecting such peaks in
Gaussian fields: they are themselves hierarchically distributed with scaling
parameters $S_p=p^{(p-2)}$. This kind of bias is also factorizable, thus in
principle furnishing a simple test of this class of models.

rich spectrum of H_2 lines observed at the same position to correct for

that similar excitation conditions apply to H_2 and HD. Accounting for non-LTE
HD level populations in a partially dissociated gas, our best estimate for the

relative to H_2 in partially dissociative shocks we derive a deuterium

synchronize the neuronal discharge in in vitro hippocampal slices. Subsequent
theoretical work has shown that strong synchronization by mutual inhibition is
only moderately robust against neuronal heterogeneities in the current drive,
provided by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. In vivo neurons
display greater variability in the interspike intervals due to the presence of
synaptic noise. Noise and heterogeneity affect synchronization properties
differently. In this paper we study using model simulations how robust
synchronization can be in the presence of synaptic noise and neuronal
heterogeneity. We find that with at least a minimum amount of noise stochastic
weak synchronization (SWS) (i.e. when neurons spike within a short interval
from each other, but not necessarily at each period) is produced that is much
more robust than strong synchronization (i.e. when neurons spike each period).
The statistics of the SWS population discharge are consistent with previous
experimental data. We find robust SWS in the gamma frequency range (20-80 Hz)
for a stronger synaptic coupling compared to previous models and for networks
with 10 -- 1000 neurons.

holographic theory in the context of cosmology may have problems with unitarity

Fischler and Susskind, implies that the entropy of matter inside the

horizon. Their conjecture was very successful for a wide class of open and flat
universes, but it did not apply to closed universes. Bak and Rey proposed a
different holographic bound on entropy which was valid for closed universes of
a certain type. However, as we will show, neither proposal applies to open,

constant. We will argue, in agreement with Easther, Lowe, and Veneziano, that
