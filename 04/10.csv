velocities of galaxies by applying an improved maximum-likelihood technique to
the new all-sky SFI catalog. Parametric models are used for the power spectrum
and the errors, and the free parameters are determined by assuming Gaussian
velocity fields and errors and maximizing the probability of the data given the
model. It has been applied to generalized CDM models with and without COBE
normalization. The method has been carefully tested using artificial SFI
catalogs. The most likely distance errors are found to be similar to the
original error estimates in the SFI data. The general result that is not very
sensitive to the prior model used is a relatively high amplitude of the power
spectrum. For example, at k=0.1 h/Mpc we find P(k)\Omega^{1.2}=(4.4+/-1.7)X10^3
(Mpc/h)^3. An integral over the power spectrum yields
\sigma_8\Omega^{0.6}=0.82+/-0.12. Model-dependent constraints on the
cosmological parameters are obtained for families of CDM models. For example,
for COBE-normalized \Lambda CDM models (scalar fluctuations only), the
maximum-likelihood result can be approximated by \Omega n^{2} h_{60}^{1.3}
=0.58+/-0.11. The formal random errors quoted correspond to the 90% confidence
level. The total uncertainty, including systematic errors associated with
nonlinear effects, may be larger by a factor of ~2. These results are in
agreement with an application of a similar method to other data (Mark III).

  We calculated absorption and emission coefficients without any
approximations, also taking into account absorption by the ambient thermal
plasma. A power-law energy distribution for the fast electrons was used, as is
indicated by X-ray and microwave observations.
  We developed a model for the saturation length and amplification ratio of the
maser, scanned a large parameter space, and calculated the absorption and
emission coefficients for every frequency and angle.
  Previous studies concluded that the unobservable Z-mode dominates in the nu_p
\~ nu_B region, and that millisecond spikes are produced in the region nu_p /
nu_B<0.25. We find that the observable O-mode and X-mode can produce emission
in the 0.8<nu_p / nu_B<2 region, which is expected at the footpoints of a
flaring magnetic loop.
  The important criterion for observability is the saturation length and not
the growth rate, as was assumed previously, and even when the Z-mode is the
most strongly amplified, less strongly amplified O-mode or X-mode are still
intense enough to be observed.
  The brightness temperature computed with our model for the saturation length
is found to be of order 10^{16} K and higher. The emission is usually at a
frequency of 2.06 nu_B, and at angles 30-60 degrees to the magnetic field. The
rise time of the amplified emission to maximum is a few tenths of a millisecond
to a few milliseconds, and the emission persists for as long as new fast
electrons arrive into the maser region.

well as the propagation distance for those having significant delay between
formation and burst production, i.e., double neutron star (DNS) mergers and
black hole-neutron star (BH/NS) mergers. For reasonable assumptions regarding
the many uncertainties in population synthesis, we calculate a daily event rate
in the universe for i) merging neutron stars: ~100/day; ii) neutron-star black
hole mergers: ~450/day; iii) collapsars: ~10,000/day; iv) helium star black
hole mergers: ~1000/day; and v) white dwarf black hole mergers: ~20/day. The
range of uncertainty in these numbers however, is very large, typically two to
three orders of magnitude. These rates must additionally be multiplied by any
relevant beaming factor and sampling fraction (if the entire universal set of
models is not being observed). Depending upon the mass of the host galaxy, half
of the DNS and BH/NS mergers will happen within 60kpc (for a Milky-Way massed
galaxy) to 5Mpc (for a galaxy with negligible mass) from the galactic center.
Because of the delay time, neutron star and black hole mergers will happen at a
redshift 0.5 to 0.8 times that of the other classes of models. Information is
still lacking regarding the hosts of short hard bursts, but we suggest that
they are due to DNS and BH/NS mergers and thus will ultimately be determined to
lie outside of galaxies and at a closer mean distance than long complex bursts
(which we attribute to collapsars).

of this smoothing process are discussed. In particular, if the circumburster

be steeper than $\nu^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha=0.75-1.25$, regardless of the

Sine-Gordon equation under quantum fluctuations is studied. The basic equations
are derived from the coherent state approximation to the functional
Schr\""odinger equation for the field. These equations are solved asymptotically
and numerically for three physical situations. The first is the study of the
nonlinear mechanism responsible for the quantum stability of the soliton in the
presence of low momentum fluctuations. The second considers the scattering of a
wave by the Soliton. Finally the third problem considered is the collision of
Solitons and the stability of a breather.
  It is shown that the complete integrability of the Sine-Gordon equation
precludes fusion and splitting processes in this simplified model.
  The approximate results obtained are non-perturbative in nature, and are
valid for the full nonlinear interaction in the limit of low momentum
fluctuations. It is also found that these approximate results are in good
agreement with full numerical solutions of the governing equations. This
suggests that a similar approach could be used for the baby Skyrme model, which
is not completely integrable. In this case the higher space dimensionality and
the internal degrees of freedom which prevent the integrability will be
responsable for fusion and splitting processes. This work provides a starting
point in the numerical solution of the full quantum problem of the interaction
of the field with a fluctuation.

presented. In this theory a fluid replaces the Higgs scalar field. Fluid
electrodynamics might have application to the theory of low temperature Helium
superfluids, but here it is argued that it provides an alternative method of
approaching symmetry breaking in particle physics. The method of constructing
fluid electrodynamics is to start with the velocity decomposition of a perfect
fluid as in general relativity. A unit vector tangent to the flow lines of an
isentropic fluid can be written in terms of scalar potentials:
$V_a=h^{-1}(\ph_a+\al\bt_a-\th S)$. A novel interacting charged fluid can be
obtained by applying the covariant derivative: $D_a=\p_a+ieA_a$ to these scalar
potentials. This fluid is no longer isentropic and there are choices for which
it either obeys the second law of thermodynamics or not. A mass term of the
correct sign occurs for the $A$ term in the stress, and this mass term depends
on the potentials in the above vector. The charged fluid can be reduced to
scalar electrodynamics and the standard approach to symmetry breaking applied;
alternatively a mass can be induced by the fluid by using just the
thermodynamic potentials and then fixing at a critical point, if this is taken
to be the Bose condensation point then the induced mass is negligible.
