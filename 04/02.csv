companion of the Earth, a new theory of coorbital motion has been developed
whereby planets or satellites can maintain companion objects in the same orbit
as themselves. This has led to the prediction of hitherto unknown types of
stable motion, all of which are seen in the evolution of specific near-Earth
asteroids. The slow diffusion of such objects through the Earth's coorbital

undiscovered retrograde moons of the Earth.

$M_f \sim (1 - 10) $ TeV scale quantum gravity for neutrino physics. In these
theories, the left-handed neutrinos as well as other standard model (SM)
particles, are localized on a brane embedded in the bulk of large extra space.
Mixing of neutrinos with (SM) singlet fermions propagating in the bulk is
naturally suppressed by the volume factor $M_f/M_P \sim 3\cdot 10^{-16} -
3\cdot 10^{-15}$, where $M_P$ is the Planck mass. Properties of the neutrino
oscillations and the resonance conversion to the bulk fermions are considered.
We show that the resonance conversion of the electron neutrinos to the light
bulk fermions can solve the solar neutrino problem. The signature of the
solution is the peculiar distortion of the solar neutrino spectrum. The
solution implies that the radius of at least one extra dimension should be in
the range 0.06 - 0.1 mm {\it irrespective} of total number of extra dimensions.
The corresponding modification of the Newtonian law is within the range of
sensitivity of proposed sub-millimeter experiments, thus providing a verifiable
link between neutrino physics and the gravity measurements.

features of all critical phenomena. Some of the measures involve wavelet
analysis. Two of the measures are found to exhibit the canonical power-law
behavior near the critical temperature. The effect of final-state randomization
is studied by requiring the produced particles to take random walks in the
transverse plane. It is demonstrated that for the measures considered the
dependence on the randomization process is weak. Since temperature is not a
directly measurable variable, the average hadronic density of a portion of each
event is used as the control variable that is measurable. The event-to-event
fluctuations are taken into account in the study of the dependence of the

critical behaviors are found and are proposed for use as a signature of

complex structure from the almost complex structure of the ambient manifold M.
These complex jump points then determine the genus of smooth representative of

are interrelated. The base state of this principle, however, currently has no
specific physical reality. Instead, it is a definition: a set of conditions at
which the gas state reaches its maximum compression and liquid can not longer
form; namely, the critical point.
  This article shows that a discrete, real-life, 3-D, base state is consistent
with published and new experimental data. The mathematical analyses were
conducted in the same manner for all the materials using literature data, a
simple, consistent liquid state model and a simple, physically definable,
cluster state model at the critical point. The base state described herein has
molecules traveling together in well-defined small-hard or large-soft clusters.
These clusters are dubbed the DELTA state since they occur almost exclusively
in tetrahedral groups of four. From this straightforward, mathematical and
intuitive methodology, the DELTA state emerged as the fourth state of matter:
the base state of the corresponding states. As a result, the universal gas law
requires inclusion of the DELTA state with the monomer state to be accurate.
The critical point is the point at which liquid ceases to form. It is also the
point at which only the DELTA state exists. Hence, the critical point is more
appropriately called the DELTA POINT.

collapsed bubble. In this way we shall derive an estimate for the spectrum and
total energy emitted. This latter will be shown to be proportional to the
volume of space over which the refractive index changes, as Schwinger
predicted. After this preliminary check we shall deal with the physical
constraints that any viable dynamical model for SL has to satisfy in order to
fit the experimental data. We shall emphasize the importance of the timescale
of the change in refractive index. This discussion will led us to propose a
somewhat different version of dynamical Casimir effect in which the change in
volume of the bubble is no longer the only source for the change in the
refractive index.
