to detect galactic dark matter objects, and we suggest that the lack of short
period star-microlensing events observed for stars near the Galaxy does not
preclude either the ``rogue planets'' identified from quasar-microlensing by
Schild 1996 as the missing-mass of a lens galaxy, or the clumps of such objects
predicted by the new Gibson 1996-2000 hydro-gravitational theory as the
inner-halo galactic dark matter. We point out that such micro-brown-dwarfs in
nonlinear accretional cascades to form stars give intermittent lognormal number
density n_p distributions. Hence, star-microlensing searches that focus on a
small fraction of the sky and assume a uniform distribution for n_p are subject
to undersampling errors. Sparse independent samples give modes smaller than
means of the highly skewed lognormal distributions expected.
Quasar-microlensing searches with higher optical depths are less affected by
intermittency. We attempt to reconcile the results of the star-microlensing and
quasar-microlensing studies. We conclude that star microlensing searches cannot
exclude and are unlikely to even detect these objects so easily observed by
quasar-microlensing and so robustly predicted by the new theory.

Press-Schechter (PS) formalism to the nongaussian case, and calculate the
likelihood that a cluster as massive as MS1054 would appear in the EMSS. The
probability of finding an MS1054-like cluster depends only on $\omegam$ and the
extent of primordial nongaussianity. We quantify the latter by adopting a
specific functional form for the PDF, denoted $\psi_\lambda,$ which tends to
Gaussianity for $\lambda\gg 1,$ and show how $\lambda$ is related to the more
familiar statistic $T,$ the probability of $\ge 3\sigma$ fluctuations for a
given PDF relative to a Gaussian. We find that Gaussian initial density
fluctuations are consistent with the data on MS1054 only if $\omegam\simlt
0.2.$ For $\omegam\ge 0.25$ a significant degree of nongaussianity is required,
unless the mass of MS1054 has been substantially overestimated by X-ray and

increasing function of $\omegam$ for $0.25 \le \omegam \le 0.45,$ with $\lambda

errors happen to fit a Cepheid light curve of significant amplitude for some

measured mostly with HST. A straightforward application of the inverse relation
yielded H_0\approx 80 km/sec/Mpc for the diameter relation and H_0\approx 70

and from magnitudes about 30 percent larger than the corresponding direct

in terms of a selection effect in log V_max nor by the dependence of the

well as extended sources, regardless of any loss of resolution with the
off-axis angle. Sources are detected as significant enhancements in the wavelet
space, after the subtraction of the non-flat components of the background.
Detection thresholds are computed through Monte Carlo simulations in order to
establish the expected number of spurious sources per field. The source
characterization is performed through a multi-source fitting in the wavelet
space. The procedure is designed to correctly deal with very crowded fields,
allowing for the simultaneous characterization of nearby sources. To obtain a

coefficients. We test the performance of this algorithm on synthetic fields,
analyzing with particular care the characterization of sources in poor
background situations, where the assumption of Gaussian statistics does not

underestimated errors, we infer errors through a procedure which relies on
robust basic statistics. Our algorithm is well suited for the analysis of

based on two steps. First, a generating function g(x) is associated with an
individual system, and a hysteresis evolution operator is defined by an
appropriate envelope construction applied to g(x), inspired by the overdamped
dynamics of systems evolving in multistable free energy landscapes. Second, the
average hysteresis response of an ensemble of such systems is expressed as a
functional integral over the space G of all admissible generating functions,
under the assumption that an appropriate measure m has been introduced in G.
The consequences of the formulation are analyzed in detail in the case where
the measure m is generated by a continuous, Markovian stochastic process. The
calculation of the hysteresis properties of the ensemble is reduced to the
solution of the level-crossing problem for the stochastic process. In
particular, it is shown that, when the process is translationally invariant
(homogeneous), the ensuing hysteresis properties can be exactly described by
the Preisach model of hysteresis, and the associated Preisach distribution is
expressed in closed analytic form in terms of the drift and diffusion
parameters of the Markovian process. Possible applications of the formulation
are suggested, concerning the interpretation of magnetic hysteresis due to
domain wall motion in quenched-in disorder, and the interpretation of critical
state models of superconducting hysteresis.

within a Liouville string formulation of quantum gravity that also suggests a
frequency-dependent refractive index of the particle vacuum. We construct an
explicit realization by treating photon propagation through quantum excitations
of $D$-brane fluctuations in the space-time foam. These are described by
higher-genus string effects, that lead to stochastic fluctuations in couplings,

  Phys., 1999",,"10.1063/1.479952",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.stat-mech physics.comp-ph q-bio",,"  We present a new method, the analytical rebridging scheme, for Monte Carlo
simulation of proline-containing, cyclic peptides. The cis/trans isomerization
is accommodated by allowing for two states of the amide bond. We apply our
method to five peptides that have been previously characterized by NMR methods.
Our simulations achieve effective equilibration and agree well with
experimental data in all cases. We discuss the importance of effective
equilibration and the role of bond flexibility and solvent effects on the
predicted equilibrium properties.

the building blocks of nature. A related triumph a deep understanding of the
forces of interaction. In particular, it has been possible to understand the
four fundamental forces of nature in an elegant and unified mathematical
framework. The paradigm for this unification has been the principle of gauge
symmetry.
  A new approach to achieving further unification relies on Supersymmetry. This
is a symmetry which relates particles of integer spin with those of
half-integral spin and also dictates the allowed interactions among these
particles. However, no data exist pointing to the presence of this symmetry; it
may indeed be of no relevance to nature.
  In this paper the gauge principle and unification attempts are briefly
reviewed, and then Supersymmetry is introduced. The notion of ""broken"" symmetry
is discussed, which may explain why the symmetry is difficult to observe at
presently accessible energies. But a badly broken manifestation seems to remove
much of the original appeal and elegance of the theory. We here propose two
alternative views of the status of Supersymmetry from fundamental standpoint.
There is a good reason why it is indeed a fundamental symmetry, despite badly
broken. The alternative is that it is an organizing principle, somewhat like
valence. This makes it valuable as a signpost to new Physics.

  180:219-238, 1999","10.1016/S0045-7825(99)00076-6",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.ao-ph",,"  In this work the issue of whether key energetic properties (nonlinear,
exponential-type dissipation in the abscence of forcing and long-term stability
under conditions of time dependent loading) are automatically inherited by
deforming reference descriptions is resolved. These properties are intrinsic to
real flows and the conventional Navier-Stokes equations. A completely general
reference description of an incompressible, Newtonian fluid, which reconciles
the differences between opposing schools of thought in the literature is
derived for the purposes of this investigation.
  The work subsequently focusses on establishing a class of time
discretisations which inherit these self-same energetic properties,
irrespective of the time increment employed. The findings of this analysis have
profound consequences for the use of certain classes of finite difference
schemes in the context of deforming references. It is significant that many
algorithms presently in use do not automatically inherit the fundamental
qualitative features of the dynamics. An `updated' approach as a means of
avoiding ever burgeoning deformation gradients and a still further simplified
implementation are further topics explored.

analyzed as operators acting in a Hilbert space. Isometric correspondence
between Hilbert spaces of states of a free particle and a particle moving in a
soliton potential is established. It is shown that the Darboux transformation
operator is unbounded but closed and can not realize an isometric mapping
between Hilbert spaces. A quasispectral representation of such an operator in
terms of continuum bases is obtained. Different types of coherent states of a
multisoliton potential are introduced. Measures that realize the resolution of
the identity operator in terms of the projectors on the coherent states vectors
are calculated. It is shown that when these states are related with free
particle coherent states by a bounded symmetry operator the measure is defined
by ordinary functions and in the case of a semibounded symmetry operator the
measure is defined by a generalized function.

cryptography. Previous proposed proofs of security of quantum key distribution
contain various technical subtleties. Here, a conceptually simpler proof of
security of quantum key distribution is presented. The new insight is the
invariance of the error rate of a teleportation channel: We show that the error
rate of a teleportation channel is independent of the signals being
transmitted. This is because the non-trivial error patterns are permuted under
teleportation. This new insight is combined with the recently proposed quantum
to classical reduction theorem. Our result shows that assuming that Alice and
Bob have fault-tolerant quantum computers, quantum key distribution can be made
unconditionally secure over arbitrarily long distances even against the most
general type of eavesdropping attacks and in the presence of all types of
noises.
