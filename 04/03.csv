  Frontieres)",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The currently discussed theories of bulge formation are reviewed, including
the primordial scenario, where bulges form rapidly and then accrete disks, the
secular scenario, where bulges are formed by dynamical evolution of disks
through bars and galaxy interactions, and some combinations of both, where
formation of bulges and disks are more continuous and interleaved. The various
scenarios make specific predictions about the relative masses, angular momenta,
colours, metallicities of bulges relative to disks, and the bulge-to-disk ratio
as a function of time. Dynamical processes relevant to the formation of bulges
(bar instabilities, mergers) are described and tested against observed
statistics. Current data suggest a dynamical feedback from gravitational
instabilities in bulge and disk formation. It is very difficult to discriminate
between the various scenarios from surveys at z=0 only, and observations at
high redshift are presently the best hope for large progress.

of about half the stars show no detectable changes, implying that their
distributions of circumstellar material and associated dust grain properties
have changed little over this time interval. However, many of the stars with
strong silicate features showed marked changes. In nearly all cases the
silicate peak has strengthened with respect to the underlying continuum,
although there is one case (VY~CMa) in which the silicate feature has almost
completely disappeared. This suggests that, in general, an oxygen-rich star
experiences long periods of gradual silicate feature strengthening, punctuated
by relatively rare periods when the feature weakens. We discuss various
mechanisms for producing the changes, favoring the slow evolution of the
intrinsic dust properties (i.e., the chemical composition or grain structure).
Although most IRAS spectra agree well with ground-based spectra, there are a
number of cases where they fall well outside the expected range of uncertainty.
In almost all such cases the slopes of the red and blue LRS spectra do not
match in their region of overlap.

accelerated at shocks and produce nonthermal radiation. The substantial
agreement between observations and the theoretical predictions of the standard
fireball shock model provide confirmation of the basic aspects of this

valuable constraints for more detailed, post-standard models which incorporate
more realistic physical features. Crucial questions being now addressed are the

gamma-ray bursts. In the theory, a highly relativistic shell interacts with the
interstellar medium through the filamentation and the two-stream instabilities
to convert bulk kinetic energy into electron thermal energy and magnetic field
energy. The processes are not efficient enough to satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot
conditions, so a shock cannot form through this mechanism. Instead, the
interstellar medium passes through the shell, with the electrons radiating
during this passage. Gamma-rays are produced by synchrotron self-Compton
emission. Prompt optical emission is also produced through this mechanism,
while prompt radio emission is produced through synchrotron emission. The model
timescales are consistent with the shortest burst timescales. To emit
gamma-rays, the shell's bulk Lorentz factor must be greater than approximately
1000. For the radiative processes to be efficient, the interstellar medium
density must satisfy a lower limit that is a function of the bulk Lorentz
factor. Because the limits operate as selection effects, bursts that violate
them constitute new classes. In particular, a class of optical and ultraviolet
bursts with no gamma-ray emission should exist. The lower limit on the density
of the interstellar medium is consistent with the requirements of the Compton
attenuation theory, providing an explanation for why all burst spectra appear
to be attenuated. Several tests of the theory are discussed, as are the next
theoretical investigations that should be conducted.

sharply concentrate at a few microgauss, for a wide range of galaxy luminosity
and types. We then argue that this fact and the observed correlation between
star formation activity and magnetic field strength in spiral galaxies suggest
that spheroidal galaxies have formed by starbursts induced by strong magnetic

Using WF/PC and WFPC2, we searched the fields of 113 PNe for stars whose close

binary nuclei that are very likely to be physically associated, and another six
that are possible binary associations. By correcting for interstellar
extinction and placing the central stars' companions on the main sequence, we
derive distances to the objects, and thereby significantly increase the number
of PNe with reliable distances.
  Comparison of our derived distances with those obtained from various
statistical methods shows that all of the latter have systematically
overestimated the distances, by factors ranging up to a factor of two or more.
We show that this error is most likely due to the fact that the properties of
our PNe with binary nuclei are systematically different from those of PNe used
heretofore to calibrate statistical methods. Specifically, our PNe tend to have
lower surface brightnesses at the same physical radius than the traditional
calibration objects. This difference may arise from a selection effect: the PNe
in our survey are typically nearby, old nebulae, whereas most of the objects
that calibrate statistical techniques are low-latitude,
high-surface-brightness, and more distant nebulae. As a result, the statistical
methods that seem to work well with samples of distant PNe, e.g., those in the
Galactic bulge or external galaxies, may not be applicable to the more diverse

the merger remnant, based on the results of numerical simulations which
investigate both gas fueling to the central seed massive black holes in the
merger and global morphological evolution of the merger. We furthermore suggest
that some of companion galaxies tidally formed in a major merger can evolve
eventually into small compact elliptical galaxies observed frequently in the

clarify the origin of companion galaxies observed in low and intermediate

different behavior from that previously observed. In particular we have found
an electron-like FS centered around the Gamma point, and the flat bands at E_F
near the M point of the zone are absent. These results are robust over a large
range of dopings and from single to double layer samples.

resultant orbital magnetism have been studied for two-dimensional electrons
under a harmonic confining potential $V(\vecvar{r})=m \omega_0^2 r^2/2$ in
various regimes of temperature and magnetic field, and the microscopic
conditions for the validity of Landau diamagnetism are clarified. Under a weak
magnetic field $(\omega_c\lsim\omega_0, \omega_c$ being a cyclotron frequency)
and at low temperature $(T\lsim\hbar\omega_0)$, where the orbital magnetic
moment fluctuates as a function of the field, the currents are irregularly
distributed paramagnetically or diamagnetically inside the bulk region. As the
temperature is raised under such a weak field, however, the currents in the
bulk region are immediately reduced and finally there only remains the
diamagnetic current flowing along the edge. At the same time, the usual Landau
diamagnetism results for the total magnetic moment. The origin of this dramatic
temperature dependence is seen to be in the multiple reflection of electron
waves by the boundary confining potential, which becomes important once the
coherence length of electrons gets longer than the system length. Under a
stronger field $(\omega_c\gsim\omega_0)$, on the other hand, the currents in
the bulk region cause de Haas-van Alphen effect at low temperature as
$T\lsim\hbar\omega_c$. As the temperature gets higher $(T\gsim\hbar\omega_c)$
under such a strong field, the bulk currents are reduced and the Landau
diamagnetism by the edge current is recovered.

carry them away into the bulk of higher-dimensional space. Such processes are

reheats. During this non-equilibrium collision baryon number can be transported
from one brane to another one. This results in the baryon number excess in our

  In a scaling limit our processes approximate the processes describing the

pn-pair) in a semisimple Lie algebra {\frak g}. It is a double counterpart of
the notion of a regular nilpotent element. A pair (e_1,e_2) of commuting
nilpotent elements is called a pn-pair, if the dimension of their simultaneous
centralizer is equal to the rank of {\frak g} and some bi-homogeneity condition
is satisfied. Ginzburg proved that many familiar results of the `ordinary'
theory have analogues for pn-pairs. The aim of this article is to develop the
theory of nilpotent pairs a bit further and to present some applications of it
to dual pairs and sheets. It is shown that a large portion of Ginzburg's theory
can be extended to the pairs whose simultaneous centraliser is of dimension
rk{\frak g}+1. Such pairs are called almost pn-pairs. It is worth noting that
the very existence of almost pn-pairs is a purely ""double"" phenomenon, because
the dimension of ""ordinary"" orbits is always even. We prove that to any
principal or almost nilpotent pair one naturally associates a dual pair.
Moreover, this dual pair is reductive if and only if e_1 and e_2 can be
included in commuting sl_2-triples. We also study sheets containing members of
pn-pairs. Some cases are described, where these sheets are smooth and admit a
section.

obtain a wider spectrum of point sets, we consider, more generally, a Riemann
surface S immersed in C^2 and its sections (``cuts'') by C. We give S a
crystallographic isometry in C^2 by defining a fundamental surface element as a
conformal map of triangular domains and S as its extension by reflections in
the triangle edges. Our main result concerns the special case of maps of right
triangles, with the right angle being a regular point of the map. For this
class of maps we show that only seven Riemann surfaces, when cut, form point
sets that are discrete in C. Their isometry groups all have a rank-four lattice
subgroup, but only three of the corresponding point sets are doubly periodic in
C. The remaining surfaces form quasiperiodic point sets closely related to the
vertex sets of quasiperiodic tilings. In fact, vertex sets of familiar tilings
are recovered in all cases by applying the construction to a piecewise flat
approximation of the corresponding Riemann surface. The geometry of point sets
formed by cuts of Riemann surfaces is no less ``rigid'' than the geometry
determined by a tiling, and has the distinct advantage in having a regular
behavior with respect to the complex parameter which specifies the cut.

the physics related to flow is discussed as well as the interaction of flow
with other non-flow measurements. From 40k RQMD and 100k HIJING events
predictions for anisotropic flow at RHIC are presented. Using the STAR detector
acceptance, estimates for the resolution obtainable with STAR are shown. We
conclude that it should be possible to obtain good measurements for elliptic
flow with either the STAR main TPC or forward TPCs. Anisotropic flow should be
easily one of the first results from STAR.

meson spectral density in nuclear medium using the constraint equations
obtained from the Borel transformed dispersion relation and QCD Operator
Product Expansion. We will discuss the results for the scalar mass shift and
dispersion effects (three momentum dependence) for the light quark system
($\rho, \omega$), the strange quark system ($\phi$) and the heavy quark system
($J/\psi$) in nuclear medium. For the light quark systems, a nontrivial change
in the mass and width are expected, while the dispersion effects are found to
be small. Existing model calculations for the dispersion effects are compared
to the constraint equation in detail. Very small, but accurate mass shift is
obtained for the heavy quark system.

holonomy, can be used for enabling quantum computation. The computational space
is realized by a $n$-fold degenerate eigenspace of a family of Hamiltonians
parametrized by a manifold $\cal M$. The point of $\cal M$ represents classical
configuration of control fields and, for multi-partite systems, couplings
between subsystem. Adiabatic loops in the control $\cal M$ induce non trivial
unitary transformations on the computational space. For a generic system it is
shown that this mechanism allows for universal quantum computation by composing
a generic pair of loops in $\cal M.$
