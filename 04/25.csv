two important galaxies in the cosmological distance ladder -- M31 and M33 --
using detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs) and Cepheids. While rare and difficult
to detect, DEBs provide us with the potential to determine these distances with
an accuracy better than 5%. The extensive photometry obtained in order to
detect DEBs provides us with good light curves for the Cepheid variables. These
are essential to the parallel project to derive direct Baade-Wesselink
distances to Cepheids in M31 and M33. For both Cepheids and eclipsing binaries,
the distance estimates will be free of any intermediate steps.
  As a first step in the DIRECT project, between September 1996 and October
1997 we obtained 95 full/partial nights on the F. L. Whipple Observatory 1.2 m
telescope and 36 full nights on the Michigan-Dartmouth-MIT 1.3 m telescope to
search for DEBs and new Cepheids in the M31 and M33 galaxies. In this paper,
fifth in the series, we present the catalog of variable stars found in the
field M31F $[(\alpha,\delta)= (10.\arcdeg10, 40.\arcdeg72), J2000.0]$. We have
found 64 variable stars: 4 eclipsing binaries, 52 Cepheids and 8 other
periodic, possible long period or non-periodic variables. The catalog of
variables, as well as their photometry and finding charts, is available via
anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web. The complete set of the CCD frames is

24.75, B_{AB} = 24.75, I_{AB} = 23.5), we are able to accurately determine the
luminosity density to z = 1. We do not confirm the very steep evolution
reported by Lilly et al. (1996) but instead find a shallower slope,
approximately (1+z)^{1.5} for q0 = 0.5, which would imply that galaxy formation
is continuing smoothly to the present time rather than peaking at z = 1. Much
of the present formation is taking place in smaller galaxies. Detailed
comparisons with other recent determinations of the evolution are presented.

gravity realized on curved backgrounds and suitable gauge theories, has been
originated by a remarkable conjecture put forward by Maldacena almost one year
ago. Among the possible curved vacua of superstring or M-theory, spaces having
the form of an Anti-de Sitter space-time times a compact Einstein manifold,
have been playing a special role in this correspondence, since the quantum
theory realized on them, in the original formulation of the conjecture, was
identified with the effective superconformal theory on the world volume of
parallel p-branes set on the boundary of such a space (holography). An
important step in order to verify such a conjecture and eventually generalize
it, consists in a precise definition of the objects entering both sides of the
holographic correspondence. In the most general case indeed it turns out that
important features of the field theory on the boundary of the curved
background, identified with the quantum theory of gravity in the bulk, are
encoded in the dynamics of the coinciding parallel p-branes set on the boundary
of the same space. The study of p-brane dynamics in curved space-times which
are vacua of superstring of M-theory, turns out therefore to be a relevant
issue in order to verify the existence of the holographic correspondence. In
the present paper, besides providing a hopefully elementary introduction to
Maldacena's duality,

the problem of p-brane dynamics in Anti-de Sitter space-time, discussing some
recent results.
