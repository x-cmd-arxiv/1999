decays produce a gamma-ray flux whose Compton-scattered electrons naturally
explain the observed mildly relativistic exapnsion of the radio source and its
double- peaked history. Such models require a surrounding plasma, perhaps
produced by the supernova progenitor, whose interaction with the
nonrelativistic debris may account for the observed X-ray source. The radio
spectrum appears to be self- absorbed. This interpretation determines the
brightness temperature, and hence the energy of the radiating electrons,
implying a surprisingly large magnetic field. Attempts to avoid this conclusion
by interpreting the spectrum as the result of inverse bremsstrahlung absorption
do not lead to significantly lower fields. The large inferred field may have
several explanations: radiation from a central pulsar, a turbulent hydrodynamic
dynamo or an aspherical Compton current, but a frozen-in field from the
supernova progenitor is not adequate. The electron-ion and particle-field
equipartition problems are discussed. Compton electrons also explain the
inferred expansion speed of SN1987A's spots.

1.6 microns with the near-infrared (NIR) spectrograph FSPEC on the Multiple
Mirror Telescope. Our sample contains 13 radio-loud and 9 radio-quiet objects.
We have measured the systemic redshifts z_(sys) directly from the strong [O
III]5007 line emitted from the narrow-line-region. From the same spectra, we
have found that the non-resonance broad H$\beta$ lines have a systematic mean
redward shift of 520+/-80 km/s with respect to systemic. Such a shift was not
found in our identical analysis of the low-redshift sample of Boroson & Green.
The amplitude of this redshift is comparable to half the expected gravitational
redshift and transverse Doppler effects, and is consistent with a correlation
between redshift differences and quasar luminosity. From data in the
literature, we confirm that the high-ionization rest-frame ultraviolet broad
lines are blueshifted ~550-1050 km/s from systemic, and that these velocity
shifts systematically increase with ionization potential. Our results allow us
to quantify the known bias in estimating the ionizing flux from the
inter-galactic-medium J_(IGM) via the Proximity Effect. Using redshift
measurements commonly determined from strong broad line species, like Ly\alpha
or CIV1549, results in an over-estimation of J_(IGM) by factors of ~1.9-2.3.
Similarly, corresponding lower limits on the density of baryon Omega_b will be
over-estimated by factors of ~1.4-1.5. However, the low-ionization MgII2798
broad line is within ~50 km/s of systemic, and thus would be the line of choice
for determining the true redshift of 1.0<z<2.2 quasars without NIR
spectroscopy, and z>3.1 objects using NIR spectroscopy.

already been observed at this redshift. At mm wavelengths the source structure
is dominated by two extremely compact components, the northeast (NE) and
southwest (SW) components. At lower frequencies the continuum emission is much
more extended and there is also a broad Einstein ring connecting the NE and SW
components. This means that the HI and OH spectra sample a much larger region
of the absorber than the mm wave spectra.
  The HI spectrum that we obtain is asymmetric, with a peak at -147 km/s with
respect to the main molecular line redshift of z=0.88582. Weak mm wave
molecular absorption has also been detected towards the NE component at this
same velocity. The HI absorption, however, covers a total velocity width of 300
km/sec, i.e. including velocities well to the red of molecular features
suggesting that it is spatially widespread. In OH we detect both the 1667 and
the 1665 MHz transitions. The OH spectrum has a velocity width comparable to
that of the HI spectrum, suggesting that it too is widespread in the absorber.
The lack of a prominent HI peak in the spectrum at the velocity corresponding
to the SW component, suggests that the galaxy responsible for the absorption at
z=0.885 has a central molecular disk many kpc in size, and that HI is deficient
in this central region. Our observations are sensitive to the large scale
kinematics of the absorber, and to first order the implied dynamical mass is
consistent with the lens models of Nair et. al. (1993).

to be formed containing only off-pulse visibilities, thereby dramatically
improving the sensitivity to any underlying PWN. Data from the Molonglo
Observatory Synthesis Telescope were also used to provide sensitivity on larger
spatial scales. This survey found a faint new PWN around PSR B0906-49; here we
report on non-detections of PWNe towards PSRs B1046-58, B1055-52, B1610-50 and
J1105-6107. Our radio observations of the field around PSR B1055-52 argue
against previous claims of an extended X-ray and radio PWNe associated with the
pulsar. If these pulsars power unseen, compact radio PWN, upper limits on the
radio flux indicate that less than 1e-6 of their spin-down energy is used to
power this emission. Alternatively PSR B1046-58 and PSR B1610-50 may have
relativistic winds similar to other young pulsars and the unseen PWN is
resolved and fainter than our surface brightness sensitivity threshold. We can
then determine upper limits on the local ISM density of 2.2e-3 cm^-3 and 1e-2
cm^-3, respectively. Furthermore we constrain the spatial velocities of these
pulsars to be less than ~450 km/s and thus rule out the association of PSR
B1610-50 with SNR G332.4+00.1 (Kes 32). Strong limits on the ratio of unpulsed

of the hard component, which is spatially unresolved, is well represented by an
absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung, or an absorbed power-law model. However the
origin of the hard component was unclear. Thus, we made a monitoring
observation with ASCA in 1996. Although the X-ray flux of the soft and medium
components remained constant, a significant time variability of the hard
component was found between $3\times10^{40}$ erg/s and $1\times10^{41}$ erg/s
at various time scales from 10 ks to a month. The temperature or photon index
of the hard component also changed. We proved that the spatial position of the
hard component is the center of M82. The spectrum of the variable source
obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the lowest state from the highest state
suggests the strong absorption of $N_{\rm H} \sim 10^{22}$ cm$^2$, which means
the variable source is embedded in the center of M82. All these suggest that a
low-luminosity AGN exists in M82.

body decays induced by the supersymmetric CP-odd phase of the top squark
trilinear soft breaking term $\arg(A_t)$. The light top squark mass is assumed
to be close to the top quark mass $m_{\tilde{t}}\sim m_t$. The CP-conserving
phase is provided by the $\chi^+$ and $\chi^0$ cut. We find that the partial
rate asymmetry is in the 0.1% level. In the most favorable parameter region the
decay rate asymmetr can reach up to 0.55%.

sigma models and their moduli spaces in order to learn more about this
approximation. New terms arise from the reduction proceedure, some of them
geometrical and some of them dynamical in nature. The results are generalised
to supersymmetric sigma models, where most of the extra terms vanish.

related probabilistic processes. We consider the limits of these models on a
fine grid in the plane, as the mesh goes to zero. Although the existence of
scaling limits is still unproven, subsequential scaling limits can be defined
in various ways, and do exist. We establish some basic a.s. properties of the
subsequential scaling limits in the plane. It is proved that any LERW
subsequential scaling limit is a simple path, and that the trunk of any UST
subsequential scaling limit is a topological tree, which is dense in the plane.
  The scaling limits of these processes are conjectured to be conformally
invariant in 2 dimensions. We make a precise statement of the conformal
invariance conjecture for the LERW, and show that this conjecture implies an
explicit construction of the scaling limit, as follows. Consider the Loewner
differential equation
  ${\partial f\over\partial t}
  = z {\zeta(t)+z \over \zeta(t)-z} {\partial f\over\partial z}$
  with boundary values $f(z,0)=z$, in the range $z\in\U=\{w\in\C\st |w|<1\}$,
$t\le 0$. We choose $\zeta(t):= \B(-2t)$, where $\B(t)$ is Brownian motion on
$\partial \U$ starting at a random-uniform point in $\partial \U$. Assuming the
conformal invariance of the LERW scaling limit in the plane, we prove that the
scaling limit of LERW from 0 to $\partial\U$ has the same law as that of the
path $f(\zeta(t),t)$. We believe that a variation of this process gives the
scaling limit of the boundary of macroscopic critical percolation clusters.
