that, for a wide range of landscapes parameters, the number of events in time t

potential. We show that when a nuclear spiral is formed, the presence of a gap
in the PVDs, between the signature of the nuclear spiral and that of the outer

the presence of shocks and inflows in the simulations, leading to a depletion
of the gas in the outer bar region. If no nuclear spiral signature is present
in a PVD, only indirect arguments can be used to argue for the presence of a
bar. The shape of the signature of the nuclear spiral, and to a lesser extent
that of the outer bar region, allows to determine the orientation of the bar
with respect to the line-of-sight. The presence of dust can also help to
discriminate between viewing angles on either side of the bar. Simulations
covering a large fraction of parameter space constrain the bar properties and
mass distribution of observed galaxies. The strongest constraint comes from the
presence or absence of the signature of a nuclear spiral in the PVD.

are calculated by means of an exact numerical method in full relativity. For
the equations of state we select a broad collection of models representing
different assumptions about the many-body structure and the complexity of the
composition of super dense matter. The mass constraints differ from their
values in the approximate treatment by \sim 10%. Under the assumption that the
maximum frequency of the quasi periodic oscillations originates from the
innermost stable orbit the mass of the neutron star is in the range: $M\sim
1.92-2.25 M_\odot$. Especially the quasi periodic oscillation in the
Atoll-source 4U 1820-30 is only consistent with equations of state which are
rather stiff at high densities which is explainable, so far, only with pure
nucleonic/leptonic composition. This interpretation contradicts the hypothesis
that the protoneutron star formed in SN 1987A collapsed to a black hole, since
this would demand a maximum neutron star mass below $1.6 M_\odot$. The recently
suggested identification of quasi periodic oscillations with frequencies around
10 Hz with the Lense-Thirring precession of the accretion disk is found to be
inconsistent with the models studied in this work, unless it is assumed that
the first overtone of the precession is observed.

force appears as battery term in the generalized Ohm's law. The gravitomagnetic
battery is likely to saturate at higher field strength than the classical
Biermann battery.
  The coupling of the gravitomagnetic potential with electric fields appears as
gravitomagnetic current in Maxwell's equations. In the magnetohydrodynamic
induction equation, this current re-appears as source term for the poloidal
magnetic field, which can produce closed magnetic structures around an
accreting black hole. In principle, even self-excited axisymmetric dynamo
action is possible, which means that Cowling's anti-dynamo theorem does not
hold in the Kerr metric.
  Finally, simulations of the alpha-Omega dynamo in accretion flows into the
hole are presented. I assume a simple expression of alpha in this relativistic
context. The modes of the dynamo are oscillating for dynamo numbers which are
typical for accretion disks. In a zero angular momentum flow into a Kerr black
hole there is still shear, i.e. the angular velocity, Omega, of the plasma
equals the angular velocity of space, omega, and it has been speculated (Meier

reconstructed image reveals that the CDS of AFGL 2290 is slightly
non-spherical. The stellar contribution to the total 2.11um flux is less than

of 43mas x 51mas, corresponding to 42AU x 50AU for an adopted distance of
0.98kpc. Our results provide additional constraints on the CDS of AFGL 2290,
which supplement the information from the SED. We have performed radiative
transfer calculations for spherically symmetric dust shell models. The observed
SED at phase ~0.2 can be well reproduced at all wavelengths by a model with
Teff=2000K, a dust temperature of 800K at the inner boundary, an optical depth
tau_V=100 and a radius for the single-sized grains of 0.1um. However, the
2.11um visibility of the model does not match the observation. We found that
the grain size is the key parameter in achieving a fit of the observed
visibility while retaining the match of the SED, at least partially. Both the
slope and the curvature of the visibility strongly constrain the possible grain
radii. On the other hand, the SED at longer wavelengths, the silicate feature
in particular, determines the dust mass loss rate and, thereby, restricts the
possible optical depths of the model. With a larger grain size of 0.16um and a
higher tau_V=150, the observed visibility can be reproduced preserving the
match of the SED at longer wavelengths.

important to realize that Gaussian noise does not imply that the field
variables undergo Gaussian fluctuations, and that these non-quantum field
theories are fully interacting. Experience with quantum field theories (QFTs)
has taught us that one-loop physics is often quite adequate to give a good
description of the salient issues, and furthermore offers marked technical
advantages: We can sidestep the complications inherent in the
Martin-Siggia-Rose formalism (the SPDE analog of the BRST formalism used in
QFT) and instead focus attention on a minimalist approach that uses only the
physical fields (this ``direct approach'' is the SPDE analog of canonical
quantization using physical fields.) We show how to define the effective action
to all loops, and then focus on the one-loop effective action, and its
specialization to constant fields: the effective potential. An important result
is that the amplitude of the two-point function governing the noise acts as the
loop-counting parameter and is the analog of Planck's constant hbar in this
SPDE context. We derive a general expression for the one-loop effective
potential of an arbitrary SPDE subject to translation-invariant Gaussian noise,
and compare this with the one-loop potential for QFT.

are belief modelling and speech act processing. Belief modelling is the
development of techniques to represent the mental attitudes of a dialogue
participant. The latter approach, speech act processing, based on speech act
theory, involves viewing dialogue in planning terms. Utterances in a dialogue
are modelled as steps in a plan where understanding an utterance involves
deriving the complete plan a speaker is attempting to achieve. However,
previous speech act based approaches have been limited by a reliance upon
relatively simplistic belief modelling techniques and their relationship to
planning and plan recognition. In particular, such techniques assume
precomputed nested belief structures. In this paper, we will present an
approach to speech act processing based on novel belief modelling techniques
where nested beliefs are propagated on demand.

prediction that cold quark matter is a color superconductor, with gaps as large

in the instanton model. We show that the structure of the superconductor
depends on the number of flavors. In the case of two flavors, we verify the
standard scenario and provide an improved calculation of the mass gap. For
three flavors, we show that the ground state is color-flavor locked and
calculate the chiral condensate in the high density phase. We show that as a
function of the strange quark mass, there is a sharp transition between the two
phases. Finally, we go beyond the mean field approximation and investigate the
role of instanton-anti-instanton molecules, which -- besides superconducting
gap formation -- provide a competitive mechanism for chiral restoration at

We introduced in the Fourier space a triad of vector fields called helical
vectors which derived from the spherical coordinate system basis. Utilizing the
helical vectors, we proved the orthogonal decomposition of L^2(T^3) which is a
synthesis of the Hodge decomposition of the differential 1- or 2-form on T^3
and the Beltrami decomposition that decompose the space of solenoidal vector
fields into the eigenspaces of curl operator. In the course of proof, a general
construction procedure of the divergence-free orthonormal complete basis from
the basis of scalar function space is presented. Applying this procedure to MRA
of L^2(T^3), we discussed the MRA of vector fields on T^3 and the analyticity
and regularity of vector wavelets. It is conjectured that the solenoidal
wavelet basis must break r-regular condition, i.e. some wavelet functions
cannot be rapidly decreasing function because of the inevitable singularities
of helical vectors. The localization property and spatial structure of
solenoidal wavelets derived from the Littlewood-Paley type MRA (Meyer's
wavelet) are also investigated numerically.

that the relative equilibrium slowly changes orientation in the same way that a
charged particle with magnetic moment moves on a sphere under the influence of
a radial magnetic monopole. In the course of showing this a normal form is
constructed for linearizations of relative equilibria and for Hamiltonians near
group orbits of relative equilibria.
