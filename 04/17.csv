diagrams and luminosity functions with synthetic ones, based on various sets of
stellar evolutionary tracks. At a distance of 10 Mpc, the stars resolved in the
field of IZw18 allow for a lookback time up to 1 Gyr. We find that the main
body is not experiencing its first episode of star formation. Instead, it has
been forming stars over the last 0.5-1 Gyr, at a rate of ~ 1-2 * 10**(-2) Msol
per year per kpc**2. A more intense activity of 6-16 * 10**(-2) Msol per year
per kpc**2 has taken place between 15 and 20 Myr ago. For the secondary body,
the lookback time is 0.2 Gyr at most and the uncertainty is much higher, due to
the shallower diagrams and the small number of resolved stars. The derived
range of star formation rate is 3-10 * 10**(-3) Msol per year per kpc**2. The
IMF providing the best fit to the observed stellar populations in the main body
has a slope 1.5, much flatter than in any similar galaxy analyzed with the same
method. In the secondary body, it is peaked at 2.2, closer to Salpeter's slope
(2.35).

nearly flat universe in which the contributions from mass density and the
cosmological constant are comparable. This type of universe, however, seems to
require a degree of fine tuning of the initial conditions that is in apparent

  pages, 13 figures (3-6 and 12 not embedded)",,"10.1146/annurev.astro.37.1.487",,"astro-ph",,"  Quasar (or QSO) elemental abundances provide unique probes of high-redshift
star formation and galaxy evolution. There is growing evidence from both the
emission and intrinsic absorption lines that QSO environments have roughly
solar or higher metallicities out to redshifts >4. The range is not well known,
but solar to a few times solar appears to be typical. There is also evidence
for higher metallicities in more luminous objects, and for generally enhanced
N/C and Fe/alpha abundances compared to solar ratios.
  These results identify QSOs with vigorous, high-redshift star formation --
consistent with the early evolution of massive galactic nuclei or dense
proto-galactic clumps. However, the QSOs offer new constraints. For example, 1)
most of the enrichment and star formation must occur before the QSOs ""turn on""
or become observable, on time scales of ~<1 Gyr at least at the highest
redshifts. 2) The tentative result for enhanced Fe/alpha suggests that the
first local star formation began at least ~1 Gyr prior to the QSO epoch. 3) The
star formation must ultimately be extensive in order to reach high
metallicities, i.e. a substantial fraction of the local gas must be converted
into stars and stellar remnants. The exact fraction depends on the shape of the
initial mass function (IMF). 4) The highest derived metallicities require IMFs
that are weighted slightly more toward massive stars than the in solar
neighborhood. 5) High metallicities also require deep gravitational potentials.
By analogy with the well-known mass--metallicity relation among low-redshift
galaxies, metal-rich QSOs should reside in galaxies (or proto-galaxies) that
are minimally as massive (or as tightly bound) as our own Milky Way.

one-dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equations on a bounded interval is
developed. The main prediction of this model is that the statistically
preferred state for such equations consists of a deterministic coherent
structure coupled with fine-scale, random fluctuations, or radiation. The model
is derived from equilibrium statistical mechanics by using a mean-field
approximation of the conserved Hamiltonian and particle number for
finite-dimensional spectral truncations of the NLS dynamics. The continuum
limits of these approximated statistical equilibrium ensembles on
finite-dimensional phase spaces are analyzed, holding the energy and particle
number at fixed, finite values. The analysis shows that the coherent structure
minimizes total energy for a given value of particle number and hence is a
solution to the NLS ground state equation, and that the remaining energy
resides in Gaussian fluctuations equipartitioned over wavenumbers. Some results
of direct numerical integration of the NLS equation are included to validate
empirically these properties of the most probable states for the statistical
model. Moreover, a theoretical justification of the mean-field approximation is
given, in which the approximate ensembles are shown to concentrate on the
associated microcanonical ensemble in the continuum limit.

response to gravitational wave emission. For a compactification ratio M/R=0.14,
the central density remains rather constant (with a slight increase, below
0.1%) before decreasing. For a higher compactification ratio M/R=0.17 (i.e.
stars closer to the maximum mass configuration), a very small density increase
(at most 0.3%) is observed before the decrease. This effect remains within the
error induced by the conformally flat approximation. It can be thus concluded
that no substantial compression of the stars is found, which would have
indicated a tendency to individually collapse to black hole prior to merger.
Moreover, no turning point has been found in the binding energy or angular
momentum along evolutionary sequences, which may indicate that these systems do

classes of Cartier divisors (or equivalently first Chern classes of line

  Let $X$ be a normal complex projective variety. We show that the classes of
Cartier divisors in $H^2(X,Z)$ are precisely the classes $x$ such that (i) the
image of $x$ in $H^2(X,C)$ (cohomology with complex coefficients) lies in $F^1
H^2(X,C)$ (first level of the Hodge filtration for Deligne's mixed Hodge
structure), and (ii) $x$ is Zariski-locally trivial, i.e., there is a covering
of $X$ by Zariski open sets $U$ such that $x$ has zero image in $H^2(U,Z)$.

Barbieri-Viale and Srinivas (J. Reine Ang. Math. 450 (1994)), where examples
are given to show that divisor classes are not characterized by either one of
the above conditions (i), (ii), taken by itself, unlike in the case of
non-singular varieties. The present paper also contains an example of a
non-normal projective variety for which (i) and (ii) do not suffice to
characterize divisor classes.

analysed from a dressed-state point of view. A general condition for the
occurrence of partial or total trapping from an arbitrary, pure initial
atom-field state is obtained in the form of a bound to the variation of the
atomic inversion. More generally, it is found that in the presence of initial
atomic or atom-field coherence the population dynamics is governed not by the
field's initial photon distribution, but by a `weighted dressedness'
distribution characterising the joint atom-field state. In particular,
individual revivals in the inversion can be analytically described to good
approximation in terms of that distribution, even in the limit of large
population trapping. This result is obtained through a generalisation of the
Poisson Summation Formula method for analytical description of revivals
developed by Fleischhauer and Schleich [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 47}, 4258 (1993)].

usual teleportation and in the second stage, the preparer disentangles the
