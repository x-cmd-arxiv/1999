orbits escaping from three different two-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian systems
which exhibit global stochasticity. Each H=H_{0}+eH', with H_{0} integrable and
eH' a nonintegrable correction, not necessarily small. For e below a critical
e_{0} escapes are impossible energetically. For somewhat higher values, escape
is allowed energetically but many orbits never escape and the escape
probability P for a generic orbit ensemble decays exponentially. At or near a
critical e_{1}>e_{0}, there is an abrupt qualitative change in behaviour. Above
e_{1}, P typically exhibits (1) a rapid evolution towards a nonzero P_{0}(e)
followed by (2) a much slower subsequent decay towards zero which, in at least
one case, is well fit by a power law P=const x t^{m}, with m=0.35-0.40. In all
three cases, P_{0} and the time T required to converge towards P_{0} scales in
e-e_{1}, i.e., P_{0}=const x (e-e_{1})^{a} and T=const x (e-e_{1})^{b}, and T
also scales in the size r of the region sampled for initial conditions, i.e.,
T=const x r^{-d}. To within statistical uncertainties, the best fit values of
the critical exponents are the same for all three potentials, namely: a=0.5,
b=0.4, and d=0.1, and satisfy a-b-d=0. The transitional behaviour observed near
e_{1} is attributed to the breakdown of some especially significant KAM tori or
cantori. The power law behaviour at late times is interpreted as reflecting
intrinsic diffusion of chaotic orbits through cantori surrounding islands of
regular orbits.

  Future Directions of Supernova Research: Progenitors to Remnants, Assergi,
  Italy, September, 1998",,,"ut99-4-01","astro-ph",,"  Study of the polarization of supernovae has suggested that the core collapse
process may be intrinsically strongly asymmetric. There is a tentative trend
for supernova with smaller envelopes showing more polarization, with Type Ic
having the smallest envelopes and showing the largest polarization. The recent
discovery of the unusual supernova SN 1998bw and its apparent correlation with
the gamma-ray burst GRB~980425 has raised new issues concerning both the
gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. SN 1998bw resembled a Type Ic, but was
unusually bright at maximum light in the optical and radio, and its expansion
velocities were large. This makes SN 1998bw a possible candidate for a
""hypernova"" with explosion energies exceeding 10^52 erg. We show that the light
curve of SN 1998bw can be understood as the result of viewing an aspherical
explosion roughly along the symmetry axis of an exploding, non-degenerate C/O
core of a massive star with a kinetic energy of 2x10^51 erg, a total ejecta
mass of 2 solar masses, and a nickel-56 mass of 0.2 solar masses. In this
model, the high expansion velocities are a direct consequence of the aspherical
explosion which, in turn, produces oblate iso-density contours and that
accounts for the polarization. It is not yet clear how either the hypernovae or
these asymmetric models can produce gamma-ray bursts.

  Plasma Tails","Uses AAS aasms4.sty macros. ApJ (in press, vol. 521, 20 Aug)",,"10.1086/307601",,"astro-ph",,"  We propose a model for the origin of the isolated nonthermal filaments
observed at the Galactic center based on an analogy to cometary plasma tails.
We invoke the interaction between a large scale magnetized galactic wind and
embedded molecular clouds. As the advected wind magnetic field encounters a
dense molecular cloud, it is impeded and drapes around the cloud, ultimately
forming a current sheet in the wake. This draped field is further stretched by
the wind flow into a long, thin filament whose aspect ratio is determined by
the balance between the dynamical wind and amplified magnetic field pressures.
The key feature of this cometary model is that the filaments are dynamic
configurations, and not static structures. As such, they are local
amplifications of an otherwise weak field and not directly connected to any
static global field. The derived field strengths for the wind and wake are
consistent with observational estimates. Finally, the observed synchrotron
emission is naturally explained by the acceleration of electrons to high energy
by plasma and MHD turbulence generated in the cloud wake.

obtained optical long-slit major axis spectra of the ionized gas. We find: (1)
One-half of the Virgo galaxies we observed have regular rotation patterns,
while the other 50% exhibit kinematic disturbances ranging from mild to major.
Velocity complexities are generally consistent with those resulting from tidal
encounters or accretion events. Since kinematic disturbances are expected to
fade within ~10^9 years, many Virgo galaxies have experienced several
significant kinematic disturbances during their lifetimes. (2) A few Virgo
galaxies have ionized gas of limited extent, with velocities exceptionally low
for their luminosities. In these galaxies the gas must be not rotationally
supported. (3) There is a remarkable difference in the distribution of galaxy
systemic velocity for galaxies with Regular rotation curves and galaxies with
Disturbed rotation curves. Galaxies with regular rotation patterns show a flat
distribution with systemic velocity, while galaxies with disturbed kinematics
have a Gaussian distribution very similar to that for the elliptical galaxies
in Virgo. This suggests that spirals with disturbed kinematics are
preferentially on radial orbits, which bring them to the cluster core, where
tidal interactions are strong and/or more common. These interactions may alter
the morphology of the galaxy, and may also play a role in driving the Virgo
cluster toward dynamical equilibrium.

the absence due to transformation of low energy electron neutrinos can
significantly affect neutron-proton weak interconversion rates through the
lifting of Fermi-blocking of neutron decay at low energies and through halting
low-energy neutrino capture on neutrons. We find that the change of Y_p within

gravity propagates in the bulk. In addition to the ground state corresponding
to a straight infinite brane, such theories admit a (one parameter) family of
stable configurations corresponding to branes wrapping with certain periodicity
around the extra dimension(s) when one moves along a noncompact coordinate
(tilted walls). In the effective four-dimensional field-theory picture, such
walls are interpreted as one of the (stable) solutions with the constant
gradient energy, discussed earlier. In the cosmological context their energy
""redshifts"" by the Hubble expansion and dissipates slower then the one in
matter or radiation. The tilted wall eventually starts to dominate the
Universe. The upper bound on the energy density coincides with the present
critical energy density. Thus, this mechanism can become significant any time
in the future. The solutions we discuss are characterized by a tiny spontaneous
breaking of both the Lorentz and rotational invariances. Small calculable
Lorentz noninvariant terms in the standard-model Lagrangian are induced. Thus,
the tilted walls provide a framework for the spontaneous breaking of the
Lorentz invariance.
