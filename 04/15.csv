structures on scales of <10 pc. Mrk 3 was also imaged using MERLIN and the data
combined with the EVN data to improve the sensitivity to extended emission. We
find an unresolved flat-spectrum core in Mrk 3, which we identify with the
hidden Seyfert 1 nucleus in this object, and we also see marked differences
between the two highly-collimated radio jets emanating from the core. The
western jet terminates in a bright hotspot and resembles an FRII radio
structure, whilst the eastern jet has more in common with an FRI source. In Mrk
463E, we use the radio and optical structure of the source to argue that the
true nucleus lies approximately 1 arcsec south of the position of the radio and
optical brightness peaks, which probably represent a hotspot at the working
surface of a radio jet. The EVN data also provide new evidence for a 100-pc
radio jet powering the radio source in the Type 1 nucleus of Mrk 231. However,
the Seyfert 2 galaxy Mrk 1 shows no evidence for radio jets down to the limits
of resolution (~10 pc). We discuss the range of radio source size and
morphology which can occur in the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies and the
implications for Seyfert unification schemes and for radio surveys of large

24 galaxies from the Canada-France Redshift Survey, most of them with
rest-frame (U-V)_{AB}< 1.14. Unlike most previous studies, target galaxies were
selected regardless of size and morphology, from a well-studied
magnitude-limited survey (the CFRS). Our sample is therefore representative of
the most rapidly changing 1/3 of the galaxy population in the 0 < z < 0.8
range. The 15 galaxies at z > 0.45 have sizes (from HST images) and velocity
widths sigma_{v} (from emission lines) similar to those of typical local
Irregulars. This is consistent with their morphologies and rest-frame colors;
however, these galaxies are as bright as the brightest local Irregulars, and
roughly 2 magnitudes brighter than typical Irregulars known nearby. We conclude
that the increase in the number density of luminous blue galaxies at z > 0.5 is
mainly due to a population of small and unusually-bright late-type galaxies.

relation between the synchrotron and ERC emission is considered within the
framework of the radiative front model. The timescale and profile of the
optically thin emission are shown to be determined, in this model, by the shock
formation radius, the thickness of expelled fluid slab and the variation of the
front's parameters due to its transverse expansion. For a range of reasonable
conditions, a variety of flare shapes can be produced, varying from roughly
symmetric with exponential rises and decays, as often seen in blazars, to
highly asymmetric with a fast rise and a much slower, power law decay, as seen
in GRB afterglows. The onset, duration, and fluence of low-frequency (below the
initial turnover frequency) and hard gamma-ray (above the initial gamma-spheric
energy) outbursts are limited by opacity effects; the emission at these
energies is quite generally delayed and, in the case of sufficiently short
length outbursts, severely attenuated. The observational consequences are
discussed. One distinctive prediction of this model is that in a single,
powerful source, the upper cutoff of the gamma-ray spectrum should be
correlated with the timescale of the outburst and with the amplitude of
variations at long wavelengths (typically radio to millimeter).

develops non-Gaussian features as the Universe evolves. The most prominent
non-Gaussian features are massive haloes, visible as clusters of galaxies. The
distortion of high-redshift galaxy images due to the tidal gravitational field
of the large-scale matter distribution, called cosmic shear, can be used to
investigate the statistical properties of the LSS. In particular, non-Gaussian
properties of the LSS will lead to a non-Gaussian distribution of cosmic-shear
statistics. The aperture mass ($M_{\rm ap}$) statistics, recently introduced as
a measure for cosmic shear, is particularly well suited for measuring these
non-Gaussian properties. In this paper we calculate the highly non-Gaussian
tail of the aperture mass probability distribution, assuming Press-Schechter
theory for the halo abundance and the `universal' density profile of haloes as
obtained from numerical simulations. We find that for values of $M_{\rm ap}$
much larger than its dispersion, this probability distribution is closely
approximated by an exponential, rather than a Gaussian. We determine the
amplitude and shape of this exponential for various cosmological models and
aperture sizes, and show that wide-field imaging surveys can be used to
distinguish between some of the currently most popular cosmogonies. Our study
here is complementary to earlier cosmic-shear investigations which focussed
more on two-point statistical properties.

distance of approach r_o is greater than 3M). The sources of the entire

case of the Galactic supermassive ``black hole'' they are formed at about 17
microarcseconds from the optic axis. The relativistic images are not resolved
among themselves, but they are resolved from the primary and secondary images.
However the relativistic images are very much demagnified unless the observer,
lens and source are very highly aligned. Due to this and some other
difficulties the observation of these images does not seem to be feasible in
near future. However, it would be a great success of the general theory of
relativity in a strong gravitational field if they ever were observed and it
would also give an upper bound, r_o = 3.21 M, to the compactness of the lens,
which would support the black hole interpretation of the lensing object.

back action on the larger sphere, and as a consequence the joint dynamics of
the entire system has to be properly understood before reliable conclusions can
be drawn from its readout. In this paper, we present and develop a mathematical
formalism to analyse such dynamics, which generalises and enhances currently
existing ones, and which clarifies their actual range of validity, thereby
shedding light into the physics of the detector. In addition, the new formalism
has enabled us to discover a new resonator layout (we call it PHC) which only
requires five resonators per quadrupole mode sensed, and has mode channels,
i.e., linear combinations of the transducers' readouts which are directly
proportional to the GW amplitudes. The perturbative nature of our proposed

and nearest-neighbor (V) interaction are examined near half filling, with
emphasis on the effect of finite V. First, the phase diagram at absolute zero
is determined in the mean field approximation. For $V<0$, a state where
d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave superconductivity (dSC), commensurate spin-density-wave
(SDW) and $\pi$-triplet pair coexist is seen to be stabilized. Here, the
importance of $\pi$-triplet pair on the coexistence of dSC and SDW is
indicated. This coexistent state is hampered by the phase separation (PS),
which is generally expected to occur in the presence of finite-range attractive
interaction, but survives. For V>0, a state where commensurate
charge-density-wave (CDW), SDW and ferromagnetism (FM) coexist is seen to be
stabilized. Here, the importance of FM on the coexistence of CDW and SDW is
indicated. Next, in order to examine the effects of fluctuation on each mean
field ordered state, the renormalization group method for the special case that
the Fermi level lies just on the saddle points, ($\pi$,0) and (0,$\pi$), is
applied. The crucial difference from the mean field result is that
superconductivity can arise even for U>0 and $V\geq0$, where the
superconducting gap symmetry is d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}-wave for U>4V and s-wave for
U<4V. Finally, the possibilities that the mean field coexistent states survive
in the presence of fluctuation are discussed.

generalized matrix formulation forms of numerical analogue of nonlinear
differential operators. The SJT matrix-vector product approach is found to be a
simple, efficient and accurate technique in the calculation of the Jacobian
matrix of the nonlinear discretization by finite difference, finite volume,
collocation, dual reciprocity BEM or radial functions based numerical methods.
We also present and prove simple underlying relationship (theorem (3.1))
between general nonlinear analogue polynomials and their corresponding Jacobian
matrices, which forms the basis of this paper. By means of theorem 3.1,
stability analysis of numerical solutions of nonlinear initial value problems
can be easily handled based on the well-known results for linear problems.
Theorem 3.1 also leads naturally to the straightforward extension of various
linear iterative algorithms such as the SOR, Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods to
nonlinear algebraic equations. Since an exact alternative of the quasi-Newton
equation is established via theorem 3.1, we derive a modified BFGS quasi-Newton
method. A simple formula is also given to examine the deviation between the
approximate and exact Jacobian matrices. Furthermore, in order to avoid the
evaluation of the Jacobian matrix and its inverse, the pseudo-Jacobian matrix
is introduced with a general applicability of any nonlinear systems of
equations. It should be pointed out that a large class of real-world nonlinear
problems can be modeled or numerically discretized polynomial-only algebraic
system of equations. The results presented here are in general applicable for
all these problems. This paper can be considered as a starting point in the
research of nonlinear computation and analysis from an innovative viewpoint.

for nonlinear problems than the traditional numerical techniques such as finite

matrices, we obtain an explicit matrix formulation for the DQ and DC solutions
of nonlinear differential and integro-differential equations. Due to its
simplicity and flexibility, the present Hadamard product approach makes the DQ
and DC methods much easier to be used. Many studies on the Hadamard product can
be fully exploited for the DQ and DC nonlinear computations. Furthermore, we
first present SJT product of matrix and vector to compute accurately and
efficiently the Frechet derivative matrix in the Newton-Raphson method for the
solution of the nonlinear formulations. We also propose a simple approach to
simplify the DQ or DC formulations for some nonlinear differential operators
and thus the computational efficiency of these methods is improved
significantly. We give the matrix multiplication formulas to compute
efficiently the weighting coefficient matrices of the DC method. The spherical
harmonics are suggested as the test functions in the DC method to handle the
nonlinear differential equations occurring in global and hemispheric weather
forecasting problems. Some examples are analyzed to demonstrate the simplicity

and becomes an even more important discovery channel. We also point out that
these reductions in the inclusive channel do not occur for the smallest Higgs
mass where the significance is known to be lowest. We show that in such
scenarios the Higgs can be produced in the decay of the heaviest stop. For not
too heavy masses of the pseudo-scalar Higgs where the inclusive channel is even
further reduced, we show that large stop mixing also allows the production of
the pseudo-scalar Higgs through stop decays. These large mixing scenarios
therefore offer much better prospects than previously thought. As a by-product
we have recalculated stop1-stop1-h production at the LHC and give a first
evaluation of stop1-stop1-Z.

continuous real parameter $a\geq 0$ and at a=0 reduces to the SU(2,2|1)
supertwistor Ferber-Shirafuji model, while at a=1 one gets an OSp(1|8)
supertwistor model of ref. [1] (hep-th/9811022) which describes BPS states with
all but one unbroken target space supersymmetries. When 0<a<1 the model admits
an OSp(2|8) supertwistor description, and when a>1 the supertwistor group
becomes OSp(1,1|8). We quantize the model and find that its quantum spectrum
consists of massless states of an arbitrary (half)integer helicity. The
independent discrete central charge coordinate describes the helicity spectrum.
We also outline the generalization of the a=1 model to higher space-time
dimensions and demonstrate that in D=3,4,6 and 10, where the quantum states are
massless, the extra degrees of freedom (with respect to those of the standard
superparticle) parametrize compact manifolds. These compact manifolds can be
associated with higher-dimensional helicity states. In particular, in D=10 the
additional ``helicity'' manifold is isomorphic to the seven-sphere.

within a relativistic meson-exchange model of hadronic interactions. The
experimental prerequisites for extracting the $NN\phi$ coupling strength from
this reaction are discussed. In the absence of a sufficient set of data, which
would enable an accurate determination of the $NN\phi$ coupling strength, we
perform a combined analysis, based on some reasonable assumptions, of the
existing data for both $\omega$- and $\phi$-meson production. We find that the
recent data from the DISTO collaboration on the angular distribution of the
$\phi$ meson indicate that the $NN\phi$ coupling constant is small. The
analysis yields values for $g_{NN\phi}$ that are compatible with the OZI rule.

continuum mechanics of a turbulent perfect fluid with voids. Deviations of the

fields: with the average pressure as electrostatic potential, the average fluid
velocity as magnetic vector potential and the density of the average turbulence
energy as electromotive force. The waves of turbulence perturbation model the
electromagnetic waves. Cavities of the fluid serve as walls to support
stationary perturbations of turbulence. Cavitation of the turbulent
noncorpuscular fluid occurring in the presence of voids leads to forming
dilatational inclusions of empty space and of the quiescent fluid. These model
the positive and negative electrically charged particles, respectively. Due to
the dilatation, the inclusions interact with the turbulence perturbation
fields. This looks exactly as interaction of the charges with the
electromagnetic fields. Splitting and dispersion of an inclusion in the
stochastic environment model delocalization of a quantum particle.

ELECTRONIC ROULETTE. 0 and 00 serve as boundary limits and are on opposite

stray marble on the floor as part of the roulette wheel menage is taking
