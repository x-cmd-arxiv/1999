  Effect: Implications for Discordant Redshifts","Accepted, Astronomy & Astrophysics, 14 pages, no figures",,,,"astro-ph",,"  The frequency shift of spectral lines from astronomical objects is most often
explained by the Doppler Effect arising in relative motion and the broadening
of a particular line is supposed to depend on the absolute temperature,
pressure or the different line of sight velocities. The Wolf effect on the
other hand deals with correlation induced spectral changes and explains both
the broadening and shift of the spectral lines. In this framework a sufficient
condition for redshift has been derived and when applicable the shift is shown
to be larger than broadening. Under this condition of larger shift than
broadening we find a critical source frequency below which no spectrum is
analyzable for a particular medium. This gives rise to new type of screening
effect which may play significant role both at laboratory scale as well as in
the astronomical domain. We apply a simple interpretation of the discordant
redshifts in galaxy-quasar associations.

conduction dominated loops and classical loops. These solutions are then

  Journal (June 1999)",,"10.1086/300926",,"astro-ph",,"  The nearby irregular galaxy Holmberg II has been extensively mapped in HI
using the Very Large Array (VLA), revealing intricate structure in its
interstellar gas component (Puche et al. 1992). An analysis of these structures
shows the neutral gas to contain a number of expanding HI holes. The formation
of the HI holes has been attributed to multiple supernova events occurring
within wind-blown shells around young, massive star clusters, with as many as
10-200 supernovae required to produce many of the holes. From the sizes and
expansion velocities of the holes, Puche et al. assigned ages of ~10^7 to 10^8
years. If the supernova scenario for the formation of the HI holes is correct,
it implies the existence of star clusters with a substantial population of
late-B, A and F main sequence stars at the centers of the holes. Many of these
clusters should be detectable in deep ground-based CCD images of the galaxy. In
order to test the supernova hypothesis for the formation of the HI holes, we
have obtained and analyzed deep broad-band BVR and narrow-band H-alpha images
of Ho II. We compare the optical and HI data and search for evidence of the
expected star clusters in and around the HI holes. We also use the HI data to
constrain models of the expected remnant stellar population. We show that in
several of the holes the observed upper limits for the remnant cluster
brightness are strongly inconsistent with the SNe hypothesis described in Puche
et al. Moreover, many of the HI holes are located in regions of very low
optical surface brightness which show no indication of recent star formation.
Here we present our findings and explore possible alternative explanations for
the existence of the HI holes in Ho II, including the suggestion that some of
the holes were produced by Gamma-ray burst events.

far-infrared luminosities [L(FIR)] with those of ^{12}CO(J=1-0) and
^{13}CO(J=1-0) for a sample of normal and starburst galaxies, Taniguchi &
Ohyama found that the observed high $R_{1-0}$ values for the luminous starburst
mergers are attributed to their lower ^{13}CO line intensities by a factor of 3
on the average. They suggested the following two possibilities; in the luminous
starburst mergers, 1) ^{13}CO is underabundant with respect to ^{12}CO, or 2)
exitation and/or optical depth effects are responsible for the change in
$R_{1-0}$. In this paper, we investigate the second possibility using higher
transition data of both ^{12}CO and ^{13}CO emission lines. Applying the same
method proposed by Taniguchi & Ohyama to both ^{12}CO(J=2-1) and
^{13}CO(J=2-1), we find that ^{13}CO(J=2-1) is also depressed with respect to
^{12}CO(J=2-1). This suggests that the ^{13}CO gas may be underabundant in the
high-$R_{1-0}$ starburst mergers although we cannot rule out the possibility
that excitation and optical depth effects are still affecting $R_{2-1}$, for
example due to the large velocity widths in the CO emission lines. Additional
observations of both ^{12}CO and ^{13}CO lines at $J \geq 3$ are required to
better constrain the conditions of the molecular gas in luminous starburst

from less than 1 parsec to greater than 1 megaparsec. Diffuse steep spectrum
lobes on the megaparsec scale are consistent with an age of $\sim$ 10$^8$
years. On the parsec scale, a complex jet component is seen to move away from
the center of activity with an apparent velocity 2.7 h$^{-1}_{50}$ c. It shows
a central spine -- shear layer morphology. A faint parsec scale counterjet is
detected and an intrinsic jet velocity of 0.95 c and angle to the line of sight
of 25$^\circ$ are derived, consistent with an intrinsically symmetric ejection.
The central spine in the parsec scale jet is expected to move at a higher
velocity and a Lorentz factor $\gamma$ $\sim$ 15 has been estimated near the
core.The age of this inner VLBI structure is $\sim$ 300 years. Assuming a
constant angle to the line-of-sight, the jet velocity is found to decrease from
0.95 c at 20 mas (32 pc on the plane of the sky) to 0.02 c at 15 arcsec (24 kpc

produces a linear transformation between the recorded image and the deconvolved

disease propagation to networks of neurons in the cerebral cortex. While most
of the recent attention on small-world networks has focussed on the effect of
introducing disorder/randomness into a regular network, we show that that the
fundamental mechanism behind the small-world phenomenon is not
disorder/randomness, but the presence of connections of many different length
scales. Consequently, in order to explain the small-world phenomenon, we
introduce the concept of multiple scale graphs and then state the multiple
length scale hypothesis. Multiple scale graphs form a unifying conceptual
framework for the study of evolving graphs. Moreover, small-world behavior in
randomly rewired graphs is a consequence of features common to all multiple
scale graphs. To support the multiple length scale hypothesis, novel graph
architectures are introduced that need not be a result of random rewiring of a
regular graph. In each case it is shown that whenever the graph exhibits
small-world behavior, it also has connections of diverse length scales. We also
show that the distribution of the length scales of the new connections is
significantly more important than whether the new connections are long range,

loose singularities caused by multiple two-particle scatterings. We find a

Operators of the form $(1/Lambda^2) |phi^* D phi|^2$ and $(1/Lambda^2) phi^* W
B phi$, where $W$ and $B$ are the SU(2) and U(1) field strengths and $phi$ is
the Higgs field, remove the precision electroweak bound on the Higgs boson mass
for values of $Lambda$ in a wide range: $4 TeV < Lambda < 11 TeV$. Within this
framework, there is no preference between a light Higgs boson, a heavy Higgs
boson, or a non-linearly realized SU(2)xU(1) symmetry beneath $Lambda$. If
there is a Higgs doublet, then operators of the form $(1/Lambda^2) phi^* phi
(G^2, F^2)$, where $G$ and $F$ are the QCD and electromagnetic field strengths,
modify the production of the Higgs boson by gluon-gluon fusion, and the decay
of the Higgs boson to 2 photons, respectively. At Run II of the Tevatron
collider, a 2-photon signal for extra dimensions will be discovered if $Lambda$
is below 2.5 (1) TeV for a Higgs boson of mass 100 (300) GeV. Furthermore, such
a signal would point to gravitational physics, rather than to new conventional
gauge theories at $Lambda$. The discovery potential of the LHC depends
sensitively on whether the gravitational amplitudes interfere constructively or
destructively with the standard model amplitudes, and ranges from $Lambda$ = 3
- 10 (2 - 4) TeV for a light (heavy) Higgs boson.

Majorana fermion, which is known to be supersymmetric for a particular value of
fermion mass. We investigate the `soft' supersymmetry breaking of the discrete
light cone quantization (DLCQ) of this theory. There are several DLCQ
formulations of this theory currently in the literature and they naively appear
to behave differently under `soft' supersymmetry breaking at finite resolution.
We show that all these formulations nevertheless yield identical bound state
masses in the decompactification limit of the light-like circle. Moreover, we
are able to show that the supersymmetry-inspired version of DLCQ (so called
`SDLCQ') provides the best rate of convergence of DLCQ bound state masses
towards the actual continuum values, except possibly near or at the critical
fermion mass. In this last case, we discuss improved extrapolation schemes that
must supplement the DLCQ algorithm in order to obtain correct continuum bound
state masses. Interestingly, when we truncate the Fock space to two particles,
the SDLCQ prescription presented here provides a scheme for improving the rate
of convergence of the massive t'Hooft model. Thus the supersymmetry-inspired
SDLCQ prescription is applicable to theories without supersymmetry.

constant that exhibits asymptotic freedom. The evolution of the coupling with

state-dependent correlations in both 7Li and 6He. These VMC calculations
provide a parameter-free prediction of the momentum distribution that
reproduces the measured data, including its normalization. The deduced summed
spectroscopic factor for the two transitions is 0.58 +/- 0.05, in perfect
agreement with the VMC value of 0.60. This is the first successful comparison
of experiment and ab initio theory for spectroscopic factors in p-shell nuclei.

sonoluminescence in terms of changes in the properties of the
quantum-electrodynamic (QED) vacuum state. This mechanism is most often phrased
in terms of changes in the Casimir Energy: changes in the distribution of
zero-point energies and has recently been the subject of considerable
controversy. The present paper further develops this quantum-vacuum approach to
sonoluminescence: We calculate Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum
states in the presence of a homogeneous medium of changing dielectric constant.
In this way we derive an estimate for the spectrum, number of photons, and
total energy emitted. We emphasize the importance of rapid spatio-temporal
changes in refractive indices, and the delicate sensitivity of the emitted
radiation to the precise dependence of the refractive index as a function of
wavenumber, pressure, temperature, and noble gas admixture. Although the
physics of the dynamical Casimir effect is a universal phenomenon of QED,
specific experimental features are encoded in the condensed matter physics
controlling the details of the refractive index. This calculation places rather
tight constraints on the possibility of using the dynamical Casimir effect as
an explanation for sonoluminescence, and we are hopeful that this scenario will
soon be amenable to direct experimental probes. In a companion paper we discuss
the technical complications due to finite-size effects, but for reasons of
clarity in this paper we confine attention to bulk effects.

Further, it is shown that both the photon-number correlation and the
