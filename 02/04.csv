  version","Phys. Rev. D 60, 103516 (1999)","10.1103/PhysRevD.60.103516",,"astro-ph",,"  The primary results of most observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropy are estimates of the angular power spectrum averaged through some
broad band, called band-powers. These estimates are in turn what are used to
produce constraints on cosmological parameters due to all CMB observations.
Essential to this estimation of cosmological parameters is the calculation of
the expected band-power for a given experiment, given a theoretical power
spectrum. Here we derive the ""band power"" window function which should be used
for this calculation, and point out that it is not equivalent to the window
function used to calculate the variance. This important distinction has been
absent from much of the literature: the variance window function is often used
as the band-power window function. We discuss the validity of this assumed
equivalence, the role of window functions for experiments that constrain the
power in {\it multiple} bands, and summarize a prescription for reporting
experimental results. The analysis methods detailed here are applied in a
companion paper to three years of data from the Medium Scale Anisotropy
Measurement.

structures are estimated to have associated gas masses >10^5 M_sun; the implied
potential energies are > 10^(52) ergs. All of the galaxies in our sample that
show detectable halpha emission at large z also show extraplanar dust
structures. None of those galaxies for which extraplanar halpha searches were
negative show evidence for extensive high-z dust. The existence of extraplanar
dust is a common property of massive spiral galaxies. We discuss several
mechanisms for shaping the observed dust features, emphasizing the possibility
that these dusty clouds represent the dense phase of a multiphase medium at
high-z in spiral galaxies. The correlation between high-z dust and extraplanar
Halpha emission may simply suggest that both trace the high-z interstellar
medium in its various forms (or phases), the existence of which may ultimately
be driven by vigorous star formation in the underlying disk. (Abstract

X-ray binaries with relativistic jets mimic, on a much smaller scale, many of

their proximity, their study opens the way for a better understanding of the
relativistic jets seen elsewhere in the Universe. From the observation of
two-sided moving jets it is inferred that the ejecta in microquasars move with
relativistic speeds similar to those believed to be present in quasars. The
simultaneous multiwavelength approach to microquasars reveals in short
timescales the close connection between instabilities in the accretion disk
seen in the X-rays, and the ejection of relativistic clouds of plasma observed

comprehension of accretion disks and jets, microquasars may serve in the future
to determine the distances of jet sources using constraints from special

microlensing experiments, results from a complicated combination of the lens
parameters that we want to determine. Of the methods for breaking the lens
parameter degeneracy, the most promising and generally applicable method is to
measure the lens parallax from simultaneous observations of a lensing event
from the ground and a heliocentric satellite (Gould 1994). However, the elegant
idea of parallax measurement, which was proposed to resolve the lens parameter
degeneracy, paradoxically suffers from its own degeneracy due to the ambiguity
of the source star trajectory. In this paper, we propose to measure the lens
parallax astrometrically by mounting an interferometer instead of a photometer
in the proposed parallax satellite. By simultaneously measuring the source star
centroid shifts from a geocentric and an additional heliocentric satellite, one
can determine the lens parallax without ambiguity. If the already planned {\it
Space Interferometry Mission} will be used as one of the satellites, one simply
needs to replace the photometer in the parallax satellite with an instrument
for astrometric observation. In addition, since the proposed method can measure
both the lens parallax and the proper motion at the same time, one can
completely break the lens parameter degeneracy, and therefore uniquely
determine the physical parameters of individual lenses.

that the dust is heated by a point-like source with a power-law primary
spectrum, as defined by the observed optical-UV continuum, we infer the basic

sizes, by numerically solving the radiative transfer equation in the dust
distribution. In addition to the substantiated statistics, an essential
improvement over previous analyses comes from the use of optical-UV data to
constrain the primary illuminating continuum, which is needed to estimate dust
temperatures and sizes. Dependences of the best-fit parameters on luminosity
and redshift are studied and the contribution of dust in the host galaxy to the
observed fluxes is briefly mentioned. This analysis constrains the properties
of the enriched interstellar medium in the galaxies hosting the quasars. The
dust abundance does not display appreciable trends as a function of redshift,
from z ~ 1 to almost 5, and shows that dust and metals are at least as, and
often more, abundant at these early epochs than they are in local galactic
counterparts. This evolutionary pattern is remarkably at variance with respect
to what is expected for disk galaxies, like the Milky Way, slowly building
metals during the whole Hubble time. It rather points in favour of a much more
active phase of star-formation at early epochs, probably related to the
formation of massive spheroidal galaxies.

that due to the distribution of NH, its effective flux limit varies between

photo-ionization models we analyze in more detail the component at zabs =

larger than solar. This result, which is consistent with the analysis of high-z
QSO broad emission-lines, confirms the physical association of the absorbing
gas with the AGN. The observed column densities of NIV, NV and NeVIII favor a
two-zone model for the absorbing region where NeVIII is predominantly produced
in the highly ionized zone. It is most likely that in QSO J2233-606, the region
producing the NeVIII absorption can not be a warm absorber. One of the Lyalpha
absorption lines at zabs = 2.2215 has a flat bottom typical of saturated lines
and non-zero residual intensity in the core, consistent with partial coverage.
There is no metal-line from this Lyalpha cloud detectable in the spectrum which
suggests either large chemical inhomogeneities in the gas or that the gas is
very highly ionized. If the latter is true the cloud could have a total
hydrogen column density consistent with that of X-ray absorbers. It is
therefore of first importance to check whether or not there is an X-ray

phase space, that will generally assume ring shapes in the synodic frame, which
will suffer a precession in the sidereal frame. Finally we discuss possible
applications of this mechanism and find that it may be relevant for planetary

replaced with uniform approximations. It is well known that, when applying
these approximations, complex predecessors of orbits created in the bifurcation
(""ghost orbits"") can produce pronounced signatures in the semiclassical spectra
in the vicinity of the bifurcation. It is the purpose of this paper to
demonstrate that these ghost orbits themselves can undergo bifurcations,
resulting in complex, nongeneric bifurcation scenarios. We do so by studying an
example taken from the Diamagnetic Kepler Problem, viz. the period quadrupling
of the balloon orbit. By application of normal form theory we construct an
analytic description of the complete bifurcation scenario, which is then used
to calculate the pertinent uniform approximation. The ghost orbit bifurcation
turns out to produce signatures in the semiclassical spectrum in much the same
way as a bifurcation of real orbits would.

a dissipative charge relaxation resistance. The charge relaxation resistance is
determined by the ratio of the mean square dwell time of the carriers in the
conductor and the square of the mean dwell time. The contribution of each
scattering channel is proportional to half a resistance quantum. We discuss the
charge relaxation resistance for mesoscopic capacitors, quantum point contacts,
chaotic cavities, ballistic wires and for transport along edge channels in the
quantized Hall regime. At equilibrium the charge relaxation resistance also
determines via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem the spontaneous fluctuations
of charge on the conductor. Of particular interest are the charge fluctuations
in the presence of transport in a regime where the conductor exhibits shot
noise. At low frequencies and voltages charge relaxation is determined by a
nonequilibrium charge relaxation resistance.

complete state. Several variants, which formalize in different manners the
transient behavior, are introduced. The main results provide a comparison among
these notions. A companion paper establishes necessary and sufficient
Lyapunov-theoretic characterizations.

similar to the behavior of the simple models. We find a strong linear
dependence of average Ngrey on nu, with a constant of proportionality that
varies with target. For the Au target, we report a relative systematic error
for extracting nu(Ngrey) that lies between 10% and 20% over all Ngrey.

correlation in terms of information. Towards this end, the issue of the amount
of information that is transferred internally and non-locally is addressed.
There are two possibilities: the amount is infinite or the amount is finite. A
partial answer to this problem is given: it is shown that models exist whereby
the amount is finite. The EPR-Bell cosine correlation can be reproduced exactly
using on average 1.48 bits. The issue of simultaneity and the problems it poses

considered as the simplest basis for the world construction in which one of
them, a 'protofield' of electromagnetic nature, is attracted to another
protofield, or medium, responsible for the eventually emerging gravitational
effects. The interaction process is analysed within the generalised 'effective
(optical) potential method' in which we avoid any usual perturbative reduction.
It then appears that for generic system parameters the protofields, instead of
simply 'falling' one onto another and forming a fixed 'bound state', are
engaged in a self-sustained process of nonlinear pulsation, or 'quantum beat',
consisting in unceasing cycles of self-amplified auto-squeeze, or 'collapse'
('reduction'), of a portion of the extended protofields to a small volume
followed by the inverse phase of extension. Centres of consecutive reductions
form the physical 'points' of thus emerging, intrinsically discrete space, and
each of them is 'selected' by the system in a causally random fashion among
many equally possible versions (or 'realisations'). This is a manifestation of
the dynamic redundance forming the unified basis of dynamically complex
(chaotic) behaviour of any real system with interaction (physics/9806002). The
sequence of reduction events constitutes the elementary physical 'clock' of the
world providing it with the unceasing, intrinsically irreversible time flow.
The complex-dynamical quantum beat process in the system of two interacting
protofields is observed as the massive elementary particle (like the electron)
which naturally possesses the property of physically real wave-particle duality
completing the double solution concept of Louis de Broglie (see also
quant-ph/9902016, gr-qc/9906077).

with respect to unceasing cycles of nonlinear squeeze (reduction) to randomly
chosen centres and reverse extension which form the causally probabilistic
process of quantum beat observed as elementary particle (quant-ph/9902015).
Here we show that the emerging wave-particle duality, space, and time lead to
the equations of special relativity and quantum mechanics thus providing their
causal extension and unification. Relativistic inertial mass (energy) is
universally defined as the temporal rate (frequency) of the chaotic quantum
beat process(es). The same complex dynamical processes and mass account for
universal gravitation, since any reduction event in the electromagnetic
protofield involves also the (directly unobservable) gravitational protofield
thus increasing its tension and influencing quantum beat frequencies of other
particles. This complex dynamical mechanism of universal gravitation provides
causal extension of general relativity intrinsically unified with causal
quantum mechanics and special relativity, as well as physical origin and
unification of all the four 'fundamental forces' (also gr-qc/9906077). The
dynamic origin of the Dirac quantization rules is also revealed and used for
the first-principles derivation of the Dirac and Schroedinger equations
describing the same irreducibly complex, internally nonlinear interaction
processes within field-particles and their simplest systems (quant-ph/9511034 -
quant-ph/9511038). The classical, dynamically localised behaviour naturally
emerges as a higher level of complexity appearing as formation of elementary
bound systems (like atoms).
