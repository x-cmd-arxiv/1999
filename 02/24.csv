from the Low Energy and Medium Energy Concentrator Spectrometers (LECS & MECS)

confirming that this is a very active coronal source, with strong flaring
activity. The X-ray emission most likely originates from the eclipsing binary
itself, rather than from the other visual component of the system. The X-ray
light curves could be modulated with the orbital period of the eclipsing
binary, with a hint for a different orbital modulation of the cooler and hotter
plasma. The X-ray spectrum is characterized by hot plasma, with the Fe K
complex at 6.7 keV clearly detected in the MECS spectrum, and it is well fitted
by a 2-temperature optically thin plasma model with low metal abundances ($\sim
0.3 Z_\odot$). These results are in line with those found for many other active
stars. As expected, during the flare the X-ray emission is dominated by hotter
plasma with a temperature $> 4$ keV. There is an indication that the metal
abundance may be somewhat higher during the flare.

evidence for X-ray variability on a time scale of <~ 1 day. The presence of
this LLGCX in such an open cluster suggests that dense stellar systems with
high interaction rates are not needed to form LLGCXs. We also searched for
diffuse X-ray emission from NGC 288. Upper limits on the X-ray luminosities are
L_X^h < 9.5x10^32 ergs/s (0.52-2.02 keV) and L_X^s < 9.3x10^32 ergs/s

ratios in NGC 288 which are lower than the values observed for X-ray faint
early-type galaxies. This indicates that the soft X-ray emission in these
galaxies is due either to a component which is not present in globular clusters

overcome noise in the measured velocity field. Finally, we measure the 2-D

separation, and 0502+675 and 1440+122, each with $\sim 0.3$ arcsec separation.
The last two also show one or more galaxies, which could be either host or
lensing galaxies. If any are confirmed as lenses, these BL Lac objects are
excellent candidates for measuring H$_0$ via gravitational time delay because
of their characteristic rapid, high amplitude variability. An additional
advantage is that, like other blazars, they are likely superluminal radio
sources, in which case the source plane is mapped out over a period of years,
providing strong additional constraints on the lensing mass distribution. The
fourth gravitational lens candidate is 1517+656, which is surrounded by three
arclets forming an almost perfect ring of radius 2.4 arcsec. If this is indeed
an Einstein ring, it is most likely a background source gravitationally lensed
by the BL Lac object host galaxy and possibly a surrounding group or cluster.
In the extreme case that all four candidates are true lenses, the derived
frequency of gravitational lensing in this BL Lac sample would be an order of
magnitude higher than in comparable quasar samples.

fitted by the r^{1/4} law. The isophotes are all disky at R < 1 h^{-1}kpc,
consistent with the molecular disks/rings found in nearby ULIRGs from CO
observations. Each of the four galaxies in the second class has an inner
r^{1/4} component plus an outer extension. Remarkably all these four galaxies
are Seyfert 1 galaxies with luminosities in the quasar regime and with
relatively narrow permitted and strong FeII emission lines. The remaining five
galaxies fall into the third class; these objects have surface brightness
profiles that deviate to various degrees from the r^{1/4} law; indeed, one is
fitted perfectly by an exponential law. We also present new spectroscopic
observations for some of these galaxies. We establish the redshift of

emission lines of six (three radio-loud and three radio-quiet) were observed
serendipitously. In four of these six quasars, we detected associated narrow
absorption lines. Three of these four quasars are radio-quiet while the other
is radio-loud. As a result of the original target selection, the small sample
of six quasars is unbiased towards finding associated CIV absorption lines. In
three of these four cases, the absorption line optical-depth ratios deviate
from the prediction based on atomic physics, suggesting that the background
photon source(s) are only partially covered by the absorbing medium and, by
extension, that the absorption lines are intrinsic to the quasar. We have used
the method of Barlow & Sargent to determine the effective coverage fraction of
background source(s) and we have extended it to constrain the coverage fraction
of the continuum and broad-emission line sources separately. We have also
applied this refined method to the narrow intrinsic absorption lines in three
additional quasars for which the necessary data were available from the
literature. We find that in two objects from our sample, the continuum source
must be partially covered regardless of the covering factor of the
emission-line source. We discuss these results in the context of the properties
of absorption lines observed in different types of active galaxies and related
outflow phenomena. We cannot distinguish between possible mechanisms for the
origin of the partial coverage signature although we do consider possible
observational tests. Finally, we speculate on how the gas responsible for the
narrow lines may be related to the accretion disk wind that may be responsible
for the broad absorption lines observed in some quasars.

(granular) superconductors in the absence of disorder and emphasise the role of
two order parameters in the problem, viz. phase order and charge order. We
focus on the 2-d Bose Hubbard model in the limit of very large fillings, i.e. a
2-d array of Josephson junctions. We find that the algebra of phase
fluctuations is that of the Euclidean group $E_{2}$ in this limit, and show
that the model is equivalent to two coupled XY models in (2+1)-d, one
corresponding to the phase degrees of freedom, and the other the charge degrees
of freedom. The Bose metal, then, is the phase in which both these degrees of
freedom are disordered(as a result of quantum frustration). We analyse the
model in terms of its topological excitations and suggest that there is a
strong indication that this state represents a surface of critical points, akin
to the gapless spin liquid states. We find a remarkable consistency of this
scenario with certain low-T_c thin film experiments.

stability constraints are considered in various classes of models, and allow in

couplings have non-trivial momentum-dependent form factors, which at low
momentum are enhanced with respect to the case of tree-level Yukawa couplings.
These form factors may be probed by various sum rules and relations among Higgs
boson decay widths and branching ratios to fermion final states. An apparent,
large, hard violation of supersymmetry also results for Higgsino couplings.
Mixing between left- and right-handed scalar superpartners is enhanced. A
radiative muon mass is shown to lead to a relatively large and potentially
measurable contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment. If the
light-quark masses arise radiatively, the neutron electric dipole moment is
suppressed by a natural phase alignment between the masses and dipole moment,

Yukawa-type interactions are obtained from the fact that such interactions were
not observed within the limits of experimental accuracy. They are stronger up
to 140 times in some range than the best constraints known up date. Different
possibilities are also discussed to strengthen the obtained constraints in
several times without principal changes of the experimental setup.

state. Familiar examples are the Sine-Gordon and the $\phi^4_2$-model. It is
known that in these models there are also states, called kink states, which
interpolate different vacua. A general construction scheme for kink states in
the framework of algebraic quantum field theory is developed in a previous
paper. However, for the application of this method, the crucial condition is
the split property for wedge algebras in the vacuum representations of the
considered models. It is believed that the vacuum representations of
$P(\phi)_2$-models fulfill this condition, but a rigorous proof is only known
for the massive free scalar field. Therefore, we investigate in a construction
of kink states which can directly be applied to a large class of quantum field
theory models, by making use of the properties of the dynamics of a $P(\phi)_2$
and Yukawa$_2$ models.

this model in order to provide a QCD-based description of nucleus-nucleus
reactions at high energies such as they will soon become available at the
Brookhaven Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The PCM describes the collision
dynamics within the early and dense phase of the reaction in terms of the
relativistic, probabilistic transport of perturbative excitations (partons) of
the QCD vacuum. I will present an overview of the current state of the
numerical implementations of this model, as well as its predictions for nuclear
collisions at RHIC and LHC.

by a calculation, which takes into account the pion re-scattering contribution
described by chiral perturbation theory and the short-range mechanisms that are
implied by the nucleon-nucleon interaction model. The intermediate N(1440)
(P$_{11}$) resonance is excited by the short-range exchange mechanisms, while
the N(1535) ($S_{11}$) and N(1520) ($D_{13}$) resonances are excited by $\eta$
and $\rho$ meson exchange, respectively. The $P_{11}$ increases the calculated
cross section, whereas the $S_{11}$ and $D_{13}$ resonances decrease it. The
calculation takes full account of the initial and final state interactions.

  Comments welcome, E-Mail: emqg@rogerswave.ca",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  We briefly review the current status of a new quantum gravity theory called
Electro-Magnetic Quantum Gravity. EMQG is manifestly compatible with Cellular
Automata (CA) theory, and is based on a new theory of inertia proposed by R.
Haisch, A. Rueda, and H. Puthoff. Newtonian Inertia is due to the strictly
local, electrical force interactions of matter particles (consisting of real
electrically charged fermions) with the surrounding, electrically charged,
virtual fermion particles of the quantum vacuum. The force originates from each
charged fermion particle of the mass undergoing relative acceleration with the
the quantum vacuum particles. The sum of all these tiny electrical forces
originating from each electrically charged particle in the mass is the source
of the total inertial force of a mass, which is the force that opposes
accelerated motion in Newton's famous inertia law 'F = MA'. Gravity also
involves the same 'inertial' electrical force component that exists for
inertial mass described above. The Weak Equivalence Principle turns out to be a
physical phenomenon, originating from common 'lower level' quantum processes in
both gravitational and inertial mass. The magnitude of the gravitational mass
of a test mass on the earth results from the same quantity of electrical force
interactions as in inertia, but on the earth it is the virtual fermions of the
quantum vacuum that are actually accelerating downward (on a statistical
average basis) with respect to the test mass.

that transmit information and of the algorithm for translating these symbols
into sensory signals or motor actions. We show that these questions can be
separated: the information carried by any candidate symbol in the code--- a
pattern of spikes across time or across a population of cells---can be
measured, independent of assumptions about what these patterns might represent.
By comparing the information carried by a compound pattern with the information
carried independently by its parts, we measure directly the synergy among these
parts. We illustrate the use of these methods by applying them to experiments
on the motion sensitive neuron H1 of the fly's visual system, where we confirm
that two spikes close together in time carry far more than twice the
information carried by a single spike. We analyze the sources of this synergy,
and provide evidence that pairs of spikes close together in time may be special
symbols in the code of H1.

polymorphic steady state attained in sublinear systems is destabilised by
formation of a variant with above threshold fitness. Evolution in the

proposition that 'parabolic growth invariably results in the survival of all
competing species,' only species with sufficient fitness to avoid subthreshold

For $T'<T$ the pressure of heat radiation can eventually compensate the Casimir
force and the total pressure can vanish. We consider both an isothermal and an
adiabatic treatment of the interior region. The equilibrium point (vanishing
pressure) turns out instable in the isothermal case. In the adiabatic situation
we have both an instable and a stable equilibrium point, if $T'/T$ is

the Fresnel integrals was though time dependent and thus the first part in the
title of this article. In section 1 we briefly review the original formulation
of the problem of diffraction in time. In section 2 and 3 we reformulate
respectively this problem in Wigner distributions and tomographical
probabilities. In the former case the probability in phase space is very simple
but, as it takes positive and negative values, the interpretation is ambiguous,
but it gives a classical limit that agrees entirely with our intuition. In the
latter case we can start with our initial conditions in a given reference frame

discussed. A Green's-function approach is used based on the multipolar
interaction Hamiltonian of a collection of atomic dipoles with the quantised
radiation field. The rate of decay and level shifts are determined by the
retarded Green's-function of the interacting electric displacement field, which
is calculated from a Dyson equation describing multiple scattering. The
positions of the atomic dipoles forming the dielectrics are assumed to be
uncorrelated and a continuum approximation is used. The associated unphysical
interactions between different atoms at the same location is eliminated by
removing the point-interaction term from the free-space Green's-function (local
field correction). For the case of an atom in a purely dispersive medium the
spontaneous emission rate is altered by the well-known Lorentz local-field
factor. In the presence of absorption a result different from previously
suggested expressions is found and nearest-neighbour interactions are shown to
be important.
