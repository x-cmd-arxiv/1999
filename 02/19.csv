  observations of an X-ray-selected sample","10 pages with figures, in press with MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02575.x",,"astro-ph",,"  Observations at millimetre wavelengths are presented for a representative
sample of 22 X-ray-selected BL Lac objects (XBLs). This sample comprises 19
High-energy cutoff BL Lacs objects (HBLs), 1 Low-energy cutoff BL Lac object
(LBL) and 2 `intermediate' sources. Data for LBLs, which are mostly radio
selected BL Lac objects (RBLs) are taken from the literature. It is shown that
the radio--millimetre spectral indices ($\alpha_{5-230)$) of HBLs
($-0.29\pm0.15$) are slightly steeper than those of the LBLs ($-0.19\pm0.14$).
A correlation exists between $\alpha_{5-230}$ and 230 GHz luminosity. While
this correlation could be an artefact of comparing two populations of BL Lac
objects with intrinsically different radio properties it is also consistent
with the predictions of existing unified schemes which relate BL Lac objects to
Fanaroff- Riley class I radio galaxies. The HBLs have significantly flatter
submillimetre- X-ray spectral indices ($\alpha_{230-X}$) than the LBLs
($-0.68\pm0.07$ cf. $-1.08\pm0.06$)although the two intermediate sources also
have intermediate values of $\alpha_{230-X}\sim-0.9$. It is argued that this
difference cannot be explained entirely by the viewing angle hypothesis and
requires a difference in physical source parameters. The $\alpha_{230-X}$
values for the HBLs are close to the canonical value found for large samples of
radio sources and thus suggest that synchrotron radiation is the mechanism that
produces the X-ray emission. As suggested by Padovani & Giommi, the
inverse-Compton mechanism is likely to dominate in the LBLs requiring the
synchrotron spectra of these sources to steepen or cutoff at lower frequencies
than those of the HBLs.

It is shown that in a hot plasma (T >= 10^6 K) with a high overpressure with

the intrinsic time scales (e.g. for recombination, collisional excitation and
ionization etc.). Therefore dynamical models that use collisional ionization
equilibrium (CIE) cooling functions for the evolution of the plasma are in
general not correct. In particular, the emission spectra obtained from
non-equilibrium calculations are radically different. We describe a method to
obtain self-consistent solutions using an iterative procedure. It is
demonstrated that soft X-ray background emission between 0.3 and 1.5 keV can be
well explained by a superposition of line emission and delayed recombination of
an initially hot plasma streaming away from the Galactic disk (outflow and/or
winds). In addition to these local winds we also present calculations on global
winds from spiral galaxies, which originate from a hot and quiescent galactic
corona. We also emphasize that it is dangerous to derive plasma temperatures

torque due to the Lense-Thirring effect, which leads to precession of the inner

frequency Quasi-Periodic Oscillations observed in the X-ray lightcurves of
neutron star and galactic black hole systems. We investigate this possibility
via time-dependent calculations of the response of the inner disk to impulsive
perturbations for both Newtonian point mass and Paczynski-Wiita potentials, and
compare the results to the predictions of the linearized twisted accretion disk
equations. For most of a wide range of disk models that we have considered, the
combination of differential precession and viscosity causes the warps to decay
extremely rapidly. Moreover, at least for relatively slowly rotating objects,
linear calculations in a Newtonian point mass potential provide a good measure
of the damping rate, provided only that the timescale for precession is much
shorter than the viscous time in the inner disk. The typically rapid decay
rates suggest that coherent precession of a fluid disk would not be observable,
though it remains possible that the damping rate of warp in the disk could be
low enough to permit weakly coherent signals from Lense-Thirring precession.

around NGC 5907 is strongly asymmetric, being mostly brighter the NW side of
the galaxy midplane. This asymmetry rules out a halo for the origin of the
faint surface brightness we see. Rather, this asymmetry is likely an artifact
due to a combination of light from a faint ring around this galaxy (as
described in Shang et al. 1998, ApJL 504, 23) and residual surface brightness
at faint levels from stars that our star-masking procedure cannot completely
eliminate. Good agreement with the surface photometry of NGC 5907 by Morrison
et al. and other workers lead us to conclude that their data are similarly
affected at faint levels by ring light and residual effects from their star
masking procedures. Inspection of the images published by Morrison et al. and

does not have a faint, extended halo.

the fluctuations of the QCD Dirac spectrum are given by a chiral Random Matrix
Theory (chRMT) with the global symmetries of the QCD partition function.
Physically, for valence quark masses below this scale the partition function is
dominated by the zero momentum modes. In the theory of disordered systems, this
energy scale is known as the Thouless energy. In the second part of these
lectures we discuss chRMT as a schematic model for the QCD partition function

resulting from the non-Hermiticity of the Dirac operator. The analysis by
Stephanov of the failure of the quenched approximation, the phase diagram of
the chRMT partition function, as well as the properties of Yang-Lee zeros are

the reduction of the chRMT partition function to the finite volume partition
function.

characterize the centrality of the collisions using the measured number of

find that for the three targets the average backward rapidity shift of the
leading proton follows a common trend versus nu with the projectile losing, on
average, 2 units of rapidity in the first 2-3 scatterings. The average rapidity
shift increases more slowly with subsequent scatterings reaching a maximum of
2.5 units. The pi- multiplicity measured within the E910 acceptance saturates
with increasing nu in p-Au collisions while the pi- multiplicity in p-Be
collisions increases faster with nu than expected from the wounded-nucleon

Derkachov","Baxter's Q-operator for the homogeneous XXX spin chain","23 pages, Latex","J.Phys.A32:5299-5316,1999","10.1088/0305-4470/32/28/309",,"solv-int hep-th math-ph math.MP nlin.SI",,"  Applying the Pasquier-Gaudin procedure we construct the Baxter's Q-operator
for the homogeneous XXX model as integral operator in standard representation
of SL(2). The connection between Q-operator and local Hamiltonians is
discussed. It is shown that operator of Lipatov's duality symmetry arises
naturally as leading term of the asymptotic expansion of Q-operator for large
values of spectral parameter.
