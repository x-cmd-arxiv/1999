comparable to those needed to destroy bars in numerical models. We also find a
statistically significant difference in the degree of gas concentration between
barred and unbarred galaxies: molecular gas is more concentrated to the central
kiloparsec in barred systems. The latter result supports the theories of
bar-driven gas transport. Moreover, it constrains the balance between the rate
of gas inflow and that of gas consumption (i.e., star formation, etc.), and
also constrains the timescale of the possible bar dissolution. Namely, gas
inflow rates to the central kiloparsec, averaged over the ages of the bars,
must be larger than the mean rates of gas consumption in the central regions in
order to cause and maintain the higher gas concentrations in barred galaxies.
Also, the timescale for bar dissolution must be longer than that for gas
consumption in the central regions by the same token.

immediately after GRB 920723. The main burst is very bright. After ~6 s, the
burst light curve makes a smooth transition into an afterglow where flux decays
as t^{-0.7}. The power-law decay lasts for at least 1000 s; beyond this time,
the afterglow emission is lost in the background fluctuations. At least ~20% of
main burst energy is emitted in the afterglow. At approximately ~6 s after the
trigger, we also observe an abrupt change in the burst spectrum. At t<6 s, the
ratio of 8-20 and 75-200 keV fluxes corresponds to the power law spectral index
\alpha=0.0-0.3. At t=6 s, the value of \alpha increases to \alpha= ~1 and stays
at this level afterwards. The observed afterglow characteristics are discussed
in connection with the relativistic fireball model of gamma-ray bursts.

densities in the HI disks in luminous early-type galaxies are lower than in the

loss) and the presence of nuclei in the interstellar matter.
  We consider a two-zone diffusion model, with and without a galactic wind. We
find that, given the uncertainties in the background predictions, there is no
need for a primary (exotic) component to explain present data. However,
allowing for a signal by playing with the uncertainties in the background

the putative host galaxy determined from optical spectroscopy. The line
disappeared about 1 day after the burst. We have also analyzed the spectral
variability during the outburst event that characterizes the X-ray afterglow of
this GRB. The spectrum gets harder during the flare, turning to steep when the
flux decreases. The variability, intensity and width of the line indicate that
the emitting region should have a mass approximately greater than 0.5 solar
masses (assuming the iron abundance similar to its solar value), a size of
about 3 times 10^15 cm, be distributed anisotropically, and be moving with
sub-relativistic speed. In contrast to the fairly clean environment expected in
the merging of two neutron stars, the observed line properties would imply that
the site of the burst is embedded in a large mass of material, consistent with
pre-explosion ejecta of a very massive star. This material could be related
with the outburst observed in the afterglow 1 day after the GRB and with the
spectral variations measured during this phase.

formation of embedded structures, like bars within bars.
  Observation of the CO and other lines in starburst galaxies have questioned
the H2-to-CO conversion factor. Surveys of dwarfs have shown how the conversion
factor depends on metallicity. The molecular content is not deficient in galaxy
clusters, as is the atomic gas. Galaxy interactions are very effective to
enhance gas concentrations and trigger starbursts. Nuclear disks or rings are
frequently observed, that concentrate the star formation activity. Since the
density of starbursting galaxies is strongly increasing with redshift, the CO
lines are a privileged tool to follow evolution of galaxies and observe the ISM
dynamics at high redshift: due to the high excitation of the molecular gas, the
stronger high-$J$ CO lines are redshifted into the observable band, which
facilitates the detection.

nuclear densities, diquarks with spin zero and antisymmetric color wave
function Bose condensate into a superfluid/superconducting state that is
several times as dense. Various astrophysical phenomena may be explained by
gravitational collapse of neutron stars (NSs) to (di)quark stars (QSs) as a
result of a first order phase transition in NSs within $\sim 10^{4}$ years
after their birth in supernova explosions, when they cooled and spun down
sufficiently (by magnetic braking ?). The gravitational energy release drives
an explosion which may eject both highly relativistic narrowly collimated jets
and a mildly relativistic ``spherical'' shell. The slow contraction/cooling of
the remnant QSs can power soft gamma ray repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray
pulsars (AXPs), without invoking a huge magnetic energy storage. The jets can
produce the observed gamma ray bursts (GRBs) in distant galaxies when they
happen to point in our direction and the GRBs afterglows. Also the expanding
shell from the explosion may produce a GRB afterglow. The jets distort the
original SNR, sweep up ambient matter along their trajectories, accelerate it
to cosmic ray (CR) energies and disperse it in hot spots which they form when
they stop in the galactic halo. Such events in our Galaxy may be the main
source of Galactic cosmic rays at all energies.

model predicts pressure gradients within the cocoons consistent with modest
backflow. For very steep external density profiles sources may well not expand
in a self-similar fashion and in this case the model is not self-consistent.
The assumption of ram pressure confinement of the cocoons perpendicular to the
jet axis is found to overestimate the ratio of the pressure in front of the
radio hot spots and that in the cocoons. Based on the properties of the gas
between bow shock and cocoon we calculate the X-ray surface brightness of the
flow. This emission is found to be a good tracer of the density distribution
within the flow and varies significantly with the properties of the unshocked
IGM. The cooling-time of the shocked IGM is found to be comparable to, or
greater than, the Hubble time. The influence of a radio source on the evolution
of its gaseous surroundings therefore extends well beyond the limited life time
of the source itself. We compare our results with the X-ray map of Cygnus A and
find some evidence for cold, dense gas clumps in the surroundings of this

by the bow shock of this radio source. We also present an empirical model for

obtaining a broad coverage grammar: one can simply read the grammar off the
parse trees in the treebank. While such a grammar is easy to obtain, a
square-root rate of growth of the rule set with corpus size suggests that the
derived grammar is far from complete and that much more treebanked text would
be required to obtain a complete grammar, if one exists at some limit. However,
we offer an alternative explanation in terms of the underspecification of
structures within the treebank. This hypothesis is explored by applying an
algorithm to compact the derived grammar by eliminating redundant rules --
rules whose right hand sides can be parsed by other rules. The size of the
resulting compacted grammar, which is significantly less than that of the full
treebank grammar, is shown to approach a limit. However, such a compacted
grammar does not yield very good performance figures. A version of the

  Libraries","7 pages, 6 tables",,,,"cs.DL cs.CL",,"  The amount of electronic documents in the Internet grows very quickly. How to
effectively identify subjects for documents becomes an important issue. In
past, the researches focus on the behavior of nouns in documents. Although
subjects are composed of nouns, the constituents that determine which nouns are
subjects are not only nouns. Based on the assumption that texts are
well-organized and event-driven, nouns and verbs together contribute the
process of subject identification. This paper considers four factors: 1) word
importance, 2) word frequency, 3) word co-occurrence, and 4) word distance and
proposes a model to identify subjects for textual documents. The preliminary
experiments show that the performance of the proposed model is close to that of
human beings.

canonical line bundle which determines the spin structure of a compact
Hermitian spin surface (M,g,J). We prove that the Dolbeault cohomology groups
of $K^{1/2}$ vanish if the scalar curvature of g is non-negative and
non-identically zero. Moreover, we estimate the first eigenvalue of the
Dolbeault operator when the conformal scalar curvature k is non-negative and
when k is positive. In the first case we give a complete list of limiting
manifolds and in the second one we give non-K\""ahler examples of limiting
manifolds.

"math/9902006","Leclerc Bernard","Bernard Leclerc","Decomposition numbers and canonical bases","10 pages",,,,"math.QA math.RT",,"  We obtain some simple relations between decomposition numbers of quantized
Schur algebras at an n-th root of unity (over a field of characteristic 0).
These relations imply that every decomposition number for such an algebra
occurs as a decomposition number for some Hecke algebra of type A. We prove
similar relations between coefficients of the canonical basis of the q-deformed
Fock space previously introduced in a joint work with Thibon. It follows that
these coefficients can all be expressed in terms of those of the global crystal
basis of the irreducible sub-representation generated by the vacuum vector. As
a consequence, using works of Ariki and Varagnolo-Vasserot, it is possible to
give a new proof of Lusztig's character formula for the simple
U_v(sl_r)-modules at roots of unity, which does not involve representations of
sl^_r of negative level.

one to reproduce data for meson meson interaction up to 1.2 GeV. Applications
to physical processes so far unsuited for a standard chiral perturbative
approach are presented. Results for the extension of these ideas to the meson
baryon sector are discussed, together with applications to kaons in a nuclear

associated with the chiral transition in nuclear medium; the hadrons discussed
are the vector mesons,the $\sigma$ meson and the chiral partner of the nucleon.
We emphasize that the proper quantity is the spectral function which describes
the nuclear medium having a hadron; the analysis of electro-quasielastic
reactions, for instance, has a relevance to the physics of CERES. The
similarity is indicated between the physics discussed here with that of giant
resonances. Experiments using nuclear targets are proposed to observe the
$\sigma$ meson and to explore how the partial chiral restoration in nuclear
medium manifests itself.

C59 (1999) 2546-2557","10.1103/PhysRevC.59.2546",,"nucl-th",,"  The stability of the nuclear matter system with respect to density
fluctuations is examined exploring in detail the pole structure of the
electro-nuclear response functions. Making extensive use of the method of
dispersion integrals we calculate the full polarization propagator not only for
real energies in the spacelike and timelike regime but also in the whole
complex energy plane. The latter proved to be necessary in order to identify
unphysical causality violating poles which are the consequence of a neglection
of vacuum polarization. On the contrary it is shown that Dirac sea effects
stabilize the nuclear matter system shifting the unphysical pole from the upper
energy plane back to the real axis. The exchange of strength between these real
timelike collective excitations and the spacelike energy regime is shown to
lead to a reduction of the quasielastic peak as it is seen in electron
scattering experiments. Neglecting vacuum polarization one also obtains a
reduction of the quasielastic peak but in this case the strength is partly
shifted to the causality violating pole mentioned above which consequently
cannot be considered as a physical reliable result. Our investigation of the
response function in the energy region above the threshold of nucleon
anti-nucleon production leads to another remarkable result. Treating the
nucleons as point-like Dirac particles we show that for any isospin independent
NN-interaction RPA-correlations provide a reduction of the production amplitude
for $p\bar p$-pairs by a factor 2.

Wiener-regularized path integral, symmetrization prescriptions for the
propagator emerge similar to earlier path-integral formulas on
multiply-connected configuration spaces.
