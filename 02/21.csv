Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that spans 2 degrees by 1.5 degrees. We find that the
correlation functions of stellar populations are represented well by
exponential functions of the angular separation for separations between 2 and
40 arcmin (corresponding to ~ 30 pc and 550 pc for an LMC distance of 50 kpc).
The inner boundary is set by the presence of distinct, highly correlated
structures, which are the more familiar stellar clusters, and the outer
boundary is set by the observed region's size and the presence of two principal
centers of star formation within the region. We also find that the
normalization and scale length of the correlation function changes
systematically with the mean age of the stellar population. The existence of
positive correlation at large separations (~300 pc), even in the youngest
population, argues for large-scale hierarchical structure in current star
formation. The evolution of the angular correlation toward lower normalizations
and longer scale lengths with stellar age argues for the dispersion of stars
with time. We show that a simple, stochastic, self-propagating star formation
model is qualitatively consistent with this behavior of the correlation
function.

has been overlooked in previous work. In this scenario, a carbon-oxygen white
dwarf (C+O WD) is originated, not from an asymptotic giant branch star with a
C+O core, but from a red-giant star with a helium core of $\sim 0.8-2.0
M_\odot$. The helium star, which is formed after the first common envelope
evolution, evolves to form a C+O WD of $\sim 0.8-1.1 M_\odot$ with transferring
a part of the helium envelope onto the secondary main-sequence star. This new
evolutionary path, together with the optically thick wind from mass-accreting
white dwarf, provides a much wider channel to SNe Ia than previous scenarios. A
part of the progenitor systems are identified as the luminous supersoft X-ray
sources or the recurrent novae like U Sco, which are characterized by the
accretion of helium-rich matter. The white dwarf accretes hydrogen-rich,
helium-enhanced matter from a lobe-filling, slightly evolved companion at a
critical rate and blows excess matter in the wind. The white dwarf grows in
mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit and explodes as an SN Ia. A theoretical
estimate indicates that this channel contributes a considerable part of the
inferred rate of SNe Ia in our Galaxy, i.e., the rate is about ten times larger
than the previous theoretical estimates for white dwarfs with slightly evolved
companions.

symbiotic binary system consisting of a white dwarf (WD) and a low mass
red-giant (RG), where strong winds from the accreting WD play a key role to
increase the WD mass to the Chandrasekhar mass limit. Here we propose two new
evolutionary processes which make the symbiotic channel to SNe Ia much wider.
(1) We first show that the WD + RG close binary can form from a wide binary
even with such a large initial separation as $a_i \lesssim 40000 R_\odot$. Such
a binary consists of an AGB star and a low mass main-sequence (MS) star, where
the AGB star is undergoing superwind before becoming a WD. If the superwind at
the end of AGB evolution is as fast as or slower than the orbital velocity, the
wind outflowing from the system takes away the orbital angular momentum
effectively. As a result the wide binary shrinks greatly to become a close
binary. Therefore, the WD + RG binary can form from much wider binaries than
our earlier estimate. (2) When the RG fills its inner critical Roche lobe, the
WD undergoes rapid mass accretion and blows a strong optically thick wind. Our
earlier analysis has shown that the mass transfer is stabilized by this wind
only when the mass ratio of RG/WD is smaller than 1.15. Our new finding is that
the WD wind can strip mass from the RG envelope, which could be efficient
enough to stabilize the mass transfer even if the RG/WD mass ratio exceeds
1.15. With the above two new effects (1) and (2), the symbiotic channel can
account for the inferred rate of SNe Ia in our Galaxy.

spectra in the limit of a smooth CBM with density n(x)\propto x^(-\eta), where
x is the radial coordinate. The hard-to-soft spectral evolution and the
intensity-hardness correlation of GRB peaks are reproduced. We predict that (1)
GRB peaks are aligned at high photon energies and lag at low energies according
to a simple rule; that (2) temporal indices at the leading edge of a GRB peak
display a well-defined shift with photon energy; and that (3) the change in the
spectral index values between the leading and trailing edges of a GRB peak
decreases at higher photon energies. The reason that GRBs are usually detected
