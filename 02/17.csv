search for young massive star clusters (YMCs) in a sample consisting of 21
nearby spiral galaxies. We find a large variety concerning the richness of the
cluster systems, with some galaxies containing no YMCs at all and others
hosting very large numbers of YMCs. Examples of galaxies with poor cluster
systems are NGC 300 and NGC 4395, while the richest cluster systems are found
in the galaxies NGC 5236, NGC 2997 and NGC 1313. The age distributions of
clusters in these galaxies show no obvious peaks, indicating that massive star
clusters are formed as an ongoing process rather than in bursts. This is in
contrast to what is observed in starbursts and merger galaxies. The radial
distributions of clusters follow the Halpha surface brightness. For the
galaxies in our sample there is no correlation between the morphological type
and the presence of YMCs

theoretical studies of galaxy formation and evolution. Largely due to a
combination of deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging, Keck spectroscopy, and COBE
far-IR background measurements, new constraints have emerged on the emission
history of the galaxy population as a whole. While the bulk of the stars
present today appears to have formed relatively recently, the existence of a
decline in the star-formation density above z=2 remains uncertain. The study of
the transition from the cosmic `dark age' to an ionized universe populated with
luminous sources can shed new light on the star formation activity at high
redshifts, and promises answers to some fundamental questions on the formation
of cosmic structures. If stellar sources are responsible for photoionizing the
intergalactic medium at z=5, the rate of star formation at this epoch must be
comparable or greater than the one inferred from optical observations of
galaxies at z=3. A population of quasars at z<2 could make a significant
contribution to the extragalactic background light if dust-obscured accretion
onto supermassive black holes is an efficient process.

strong IR emitters ten times more numerous than expected if there were no
evolution from z<0.2 (IRAS) up to the maximum redshift of these galaxies
(z=1.5). The mid-IR cosmic background produced by these galaxies (2.35+/-0.8 nW
m^-2 sr^-1, at 15 microns above 50 microJy) is larger than 30 per cent of the
energy radiated in the I band by the optical galaxies detected in the HDF,
which are two orders of magnitude more numerous. This fraction is much higher
than in the local universe (z<0.2) as probed by IRAS, where all integrated IR
emission from 8 to 1000 microns makes 30 per cent of the optical starlight.
Even assuming a conservative SED, they produce a major contribution to the 140
mu m DIRBE background measured by Hauser et al. (1998, 25.1+/-7 nW m^-2 sr^-1)
and Lagache et al. (1999, 15.3+/-9.5 nW m^ -2 sr^-1). This is both a
confirmation of the strong IR cosmic background that was first detected by
Puget et al. (1996) and the first identification of the galaxies responsible
for a large fraction of this background at 140 microns. We find that these
bright (several 10^11 Lsol) and massive (<M>= 1.5x10^11 Msol) IR galaxies have
a typical redshift of z=0.7 and optical colors similar to field galaxies. The
fraction of galaxies with morphological signs of interactions is larger at
higher redshift. This is consistent with the nature of local luminous IR
galaxies found by IRAS, which often exhibit evidence of galaxy interaction or
merging and indicates that interactions should play a crucial role in the
evolution of galaxies as expected from bottom-up scenarios.

associated with GRB 990123 is located on an irregular galaxy, with magnitude
V=24.20 +/- 0.15. The strong metal absorption lines seen in the spectrum of the
OT, along with the low probability of a chance superposition, lead us to
conclude that this galaxy is the host of the GRB. The OT is projected within
the ~1'' visible stellar field of the host, nearer the edge than the center. We
cannot, on this basis, rule out the galactic nucleus as the site of the GRB,
since the unusual morphology of the host may be the result of an ongoing
galactic merger, but our demonstration that this host galaxy has extremely blue
optical to infrared colors more strongly supports an association between GRBs
and star formation. We find that the OT magnitude on 1999 Feb 9.05, V = 25.45
+/- 0.15, is about 1.5 mag fainter than expected from extrapolation of the
decay rate found in earlier observations. A detailed analysis of the OT light
curve suggests that its fading has gone through three distinct phases: an early
rapid decline (f_{nu} \propto t^{-1.6} for t < 0.1 days), a slower intermediate
decline power-law decay (f_{nu} \propto t^{-1.1} for 0.1 < t < 2 days), and
then a more rapid decay (at least as steep as (f_{\nu} \propto t^{-1.8} for t >
2 days). The break to steeper slope at late times may provide evidence that the
optical emission from this GRB was highly beamed.

studied using 9 ROSAT PSPC datasets. The spectrum is well described by a power
law combined with a blackbody (kT~ 70 eV) soft excess. Examination of flux
ratio changes and variability amplitude in 3 X-ray bands, shows that the power
law component varies continuously on time-scales of ~5000s and is steeper when
it is brighter. In contrast, variability of the soft excess is not detected.
Spectral modeling of 31 spectra from different observations and at a range of
count rates is also consistent with a picture in which the power law is steeper
when it is brighter, and in which the soft excess component does not vary. The
power law variability can be explained if the power law is produced by variable
thermal or non-thermal Comptonization of soft photons. This behaviour is
similar to that of Galactic black hole candidates in the low state. The X-ray
and multiwavelength properties of Markarian 766 are shown to be very similar to
those of other narrow line Seyfert 1s. This may mean that the rapid X-ray
variability seen in other narrow line Seyfert 1s may also not originate in
their strong soft excess components.

the major axis of the Sb galaxy NGC 7331. The kinematics of the ionized gas and
the stars appears to be regular, but contrary to what one might expect, the
emission line gas rotates slower than the stars in the inner regions. This may
be caused by an inner inclined and warped gas layer. In the bulge region the
absorption line profiles have a shallow extension towards the systemic
velocity, but no counterrotation is observed which is contrary to previous
claims. These claims might have been based on a wrong interpretation of the
employed analysis method. A kinematical model has been made in order to explain
the observed sizes and shapes of the absorption line profiles. It appeared
necessary to combine a rapidly rotating disc having a radially decreasing
velocity dispersion with a slowly rotating constant dispersion bulge. Then,
simultaneously, the observed stellar radial velocities, the velocity
dispersions and the observed asymmetry of the line profile could be explained
satisfactorily. An even better fit to the data can be achieved when the disc is
relatively thinner and colder inside the bulge region. For the disc a M/L ratio
of 1.6 +/- 0.7 is derived in the I band. On the other hand, a rotation curve
fit gives a M/L ratio of 6.8 +/- 1 for the bulge. An analysis of a sample of
galactic discs and bulges shows that on average the mass-to-light ratio of the
bulge is three times as large as the mass-to-light ratio of the disc in the I
band. For the B-band this ratio goes up to 7.2.

experiments have measured sticking coefficients for some materials largely
confirming the calculations. Although the detailed velocity fields of disks are
not well understood, many of the important processes leading to particle
collisions and grain growth have been studied theoretically and demonstrate
likely paths by which dust is assembled into planets. Calculations of the
radiative properties of particles with various size distributions show that
large particles should produce observable changes in the spectral energy
distributions of disks. Changes of the sort predicted are, in fact, observed,
but their interpretation is ambiguous; there are other ways to produce the

by smooth behavior and form hysteresis loops. Furthermore, the process is

A physical interpretation is that one can identify a new `hidden' quantum
number which distinguishes components in the $\lambda=3/2$ distribution
amplitudes with different scale dependence. The solution of the corresponding
evolution equation is reduced to a simple three-term recurrence relation. The
exact analytic solution is found for the component with the lowest anomalous
dimension for all moments $N$, and the WKB-type expansion is constructed for
other levels, which becomes asymptotically exact at large $N$. Evolution
equations for the $\lambda=1/2$ distribution amplitudes (e.g. for the nucleon)
are studied as well. We find that the two lowest anomalous dimensions for the

that the HEB be fulfilled at all times forces a crucial ""branch change"" to

effective Planck mass, in agreement with previous conjectures.

wave systems in the regime where sources and sinks separate patches of left and
right-traveling waves. We show that sources and sinks are the important
coherent structures that organize much of the dynamical properties of traveling
wave systems. We present in detail the framework to analyze these coherent
structures. Our counting arguments for the multiplicities of these structures
show that independently of the coefficients of the CGL, there exists a
symmetric stationary source solution, which sends out waves with a unique
frequency and wave number. Sinks, on the other hand, occur in two-parameter
families, and play an essentially passive role. Simulations show that sources
can send out stable waves, convectively unstable waves, or absolutely unstable
waves. We show that there exists an additional dynamical regime where both
single- and bimodal states are unstable; the ensuing chaotic states have no
counterpart in single amplitude equations. A third dynamical mechanism is
associated with the fact that the width of the sources does not show simple
scaling with the growth rate epsilon. In particular, when the group velocity
term dominates over the linear growth term, no stationary source can exist, but
sources displaying nontrivial dynamics can survive here. Our results are easily
accessible by experiments, and we advocate a study of the sources and sinks as
a means to probe traveling wave systems and compare theory and experiment.

proteinaceous pore by an electric field, we study the diffusive motion of a
polymer threaded through a narrow channel with which it may have strong
interactions. We show that there is a range of polymer lengths in which the
system is approximately translationally invariant, and we develop a
coarse-grained description of this regime. From this description, general
features of the distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore
may be deduced. We also introduce a more microscopic model. This model provides
a physically reasonable scenario in which, as in experiments, the polymer's
speed depends sensitively on its chemical composition, and even on its
orientation in the channel. Finally, we point out that the experimental
distribution of times for the polymer to pass through the pore is much broader
than expected from simple estimates, and speculate on why this might be.

introduced by the readout time constant due to the thermometer resistance and
the input capacitance. Using cold JFETs, this preamplifier board is shown to
have very low noise: the Johnson noise of the source resistor (1 fA/Hz1/2)
dominated in our noise measurements. We also implemented a lock-in chain using
this preamplifier. Because of fast risetime, compensation of the phase shift
may be unnecessary. If implemented, no tuning is necessary when the sensor
impedance changes. Transients are very short, and thus low-passing or sampling
of the signal is simplified. In case of spurious noise, the modulation
frequency can be chosen in a much wider frequency range, without requiring a
new calibration of the apparatus.
