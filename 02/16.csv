Mapping the universe as outlined by galaxies leads to fundamental measurements
which refine our knowledge of its structure and evolution. Redshift acquisition
has undergone tremendous progress thanks to advances in technology, and
redshift surveys appear nowadays as routine. Even though they may look simple
at face-value, the strategy of a survey and the galaxy-selection criteria have
crucial impacts on the interpretation of results. In this lecture, I
concentrate on the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution. In particular
I consider the luminosity function derived from optically magnitude-selected
field galaxy redshift surveys. The aim is to describe the approach to designing
state-of-the-art of galaxy surveys and their impact on measurements on
luminosity functions. I start by discussing survey strategies, (Section 2). I
continue by describing the data required (Section 3), and then review the
different estimators to measure luminosity funtions (Section 4). I discuss the
luminosity function evolution (Section 5) and I follow by summarizing the
status of luminosity measurements (Section 6).

in and out of a galaxy in the limit of negligible velocity dispersion. The
outer caustics are spherical shells enveloping the galaxy. The inner caustics
are rings. These are located near where the particles with the most angular
momentum are at their distance of closest approach to the galactic center. The
surface of a caustic ring is a closed tube whose cross-section is a $D_{-4}$
catastrophe. It has three cusps amongst which exists a discrete $Z_3$ symmetry.
A detailed analysis is given in the limit where the flow of particles is
axially and reflection symmetric and where the transverse dimensions of the
ring are small compared to the ring radius. Five parameters describe the
caustic in that limit. The relations between these parameters and the initial
velocity distribution of the particles are derived. The structure of the
caustic ring is used to predict the shape of the bump produced in a galactic
rotation curve by a caustic ring lying in the galactic plane.

brighter near the center of M31 as concluded by previous investigators. Our
observations and artificial star experiments presented in this study strongly
support the idea that previous very bright stars were likely the result of
spurious detections of blended stars due to crowding in lower resolution
images. On the contrary, our observations indicate that, at a mean projected
galactocentric distance of 1.1 kpc, the RGB tip is some 1.3 magnitudes fainter
than it is at 7 kpc. An analysis of this difference in RGB tip magnitude
suggests that the M31 bulge stellar population has a mean metallicity close to
that of the Sun.

detailed predictions against high-resolution numerical simulations. We show
that, when appropriate variables are used, the count probability distribution

two-point count probability distribution function (2CPDF), and the bivariate

We explore the behaviour of the bias associated with collapsed objects in limit
of large separations, finding that it depends only on the intrinsic scaling
parameter associated with collapsed objects and that the bias for two different
objects can be expressed as a product of the individual biases of the objects.
Finally we use hierarchal ansatz to develop a novel technique for correcting
finite-volume effects in the estimation of multi-point statistical quantities

model the galaxies using a fixed exponential disk with a central bulge and vary
the halo potential over a range of parameters using both the Hernquist and NFW
mass distributions, probing the effect of the halo mass, extent and
concentration. We examine the consistency of the results against both
observational and theoretical constraints on halo profiles and comment on the
failures and weaknesses of different models. Galaxies with rising or flat
rotation curves dominated by the halo are inhibited from forming tidal tails
unless the halo is abruptly cut off just beyond the disk edge. Conversely,
models with declining rotation curves -- resulting either from compact, low
mass halos, or from massive disk components in low concentration dark halos --
produce tidal tails very similar to those observed in well-studied interacting
systems. As argued by Springel & White (1998), a unifying, quantitative
relation for all cases is that the ratio of the escape velocity to the circular
velocity at around the solar radius must be v_e/v_c<2.5 for tidal tails to be
produced. The galaxy models which appear to fit most of the observational
constraints are those which have disk-dominated rotation curves and low
concentration halos. We discuss our results in a cosmological context using
recent studies which link halo properties to cosmological models.

evolution between black hole accretion and star formation introduce
considerable scatter in this relation. A non-linear relation between black hole

several good candidates for Galactic mass determinations in the intermediate

measurements several kpc above and below the disk. These clusters will help
determine the profile and shape of the inner halo. To aid this effort, we
present two methods of mass determination: one, a generalization of
rotation-curve mass measurements, which gives the mass and potential from
complete position-velocity observations for stream stars; and another using a
simple chi^2 estimator, which can be used when only projected positions and
radial velocities are known for stream stars. We illustrate the use of the
latter method using simulated tidal streams from Pal 5 and find that fairly
accurate mass determinations are possible even for relatively poor data sets.
Follow-up observations of clusters with proper motion determinations may reveal
tidal streams; obtaining radial velocity measurements would enable accurate
measurements of the mass distribution in the inner Galaxy.

is dominated by the process tau --> nu_tau a_1(1260), with the a_1 meson
decaying to three pions predominantly via the lowest dimensional (mainly
S-wave) a_1 --> rho pi Born amplitude. From fits to the Dalitz plot and angular
observables, we find significant additional contributions from amplitudes for
a_1 decay to sigma pi, f_0(1370) pi and f_2(1270) pi, as well as higher
dimensional a_1 --> rho pi and rho' pi amplitudes. The squared sigma pi
amplitude accounts for ~15% of the total tau- --> nu_tau pi- pi0 pi0 rate in
the models considered. We have searched for additional contributions from tau
--> nu_tau pi'(1300). We place 90% confidence level upper limits on the
branching fraction for this channel of between 1.0*10^{-4} and 1.9*10^{-4},
depending on the pi' decay mode. The pi- pi0 pi0 mass spectrum is parametrized
by a Breit-Wigner form with a mass-dependent width which is specified according
to the results of the Dalitz plot fits plus a coupling to an a_1 --> K* K
amplitude. From a chi^2 fit, we extract the pole mass and width of the a_1, as
well as the magnitude of the K* K coupling. We have also investigated the

horizons"" on the surfaces parallel to the Coulomb surface. In this sector, the
gauge field can be expressed in terms of a scalar field and a new vector field.
The effective dynamics of the scalar field suggests non-perturbative effects.
This was confirmed by showing that all spherically symmetric (in 4-D Euclidean)
scalar fields are classical solutions and averaging these solutions using a
qaussian distribution (thereby treating these fields as random) lead to
confinement. In essence the confinement mechanism is not quantum mechanical in
nature but simply a statistical treatment of classical spherically symmetric

analytic structure of the nucleon and pion propagators, we express the
non-mesonic component of the decay in terms of the spin-longitudinal response
function. This response has been constrained from precise quasielastic (p,n)
measurements done at LAMPF. We compute the spin-longitudinal response in a
relativistic random-phase-approximation model that reproduces accurately the
quasielastic data. By doing so, we obtain hypernuclear decay widths that are
considerably smaller---by factors of two or three---relative to existing
nonrelativistic calculations.

  Rev. C","Phys.Rev. C59 (1999) 1247-1251","10.1103/PhysRevC.59.R1247",,"nucl-th",,"  Three-nucleon forces have been considered to be one possibility to resolve
the well known discrepancy between experimental values and theoretical
calculations of the nucleon analyzing power in low energy nucleon-deuteron
scattering. In this paper, we investigate possible effects of two-pion exchange
three-nucleon forces on the analyzing power and the differential cross section.
We found that the reason for different effects on the analyzing power by
different three-nucleon forces found in previous calculations is related to the
existence of the contact term. Effects of some variations of two-pion exchange
three-nucleon forces are investigated. Also, an expression for the measure of
the nucleon analyzing power with quartet P-wave phase shifts is presented.

level shifts and widths in $K^-$ atoms, we predict that the $K^-$ atomic levels
which are inaccessible in the atomic cascade process are generally narrow,
spanning a range of widths about 50 - 1500 keV over the entire periodic table.
The mechanism for this narrowing is different from the mechanism for narrowing
of pionic atom levels. Examples of such `deeply bound' $K^-$ atomic states are
given, showing that in many cases these states should be reasonably well
resolved. Several reactions which could be used to form these `deeply bound'
states are mentioned. Narrow deeply bound states are expected also in $\bar{p}$
atoms.

governed over several decades by a power law with exponent -3/2. The
experimental findings agree with simulations of the linearized
electrohydrodynamic equations near the sample stability threshold.

system-reservoir model, where the reservoir in question is kept in a
nonequilibrium condition. Based on a systematic separation of time scales
involved in the dynamics, appropriate generalizations of the
fluctuation-dissipation and Einstein's relations have been pointed out. We show
that the Wigner-Weisskopf decay of the system mode results in a rate constant
which depending on the relaxation of nonequilibrium bath is dynamically
modified. We also calculate the time-dependent spectra of a cavity mode with a
suitable gain when the cavity is kept in contact with a nonequilibrium bath.
