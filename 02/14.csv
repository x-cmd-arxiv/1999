  eds. V. Mannings, A. Boss, S. Russell (Tucson: The University of Arizona

understanding the origin of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) with
specific focus on galactic star-forming regions. We synthesize data from
various efforts to determine the IMF in very young, partially-embedded stellar
clusters and find: i) no significant variations in the low-mass IMF have been
observed between different star-forming regions; and ii) the mass distributions
of young stars just emerging from molecular clouds are consistent with having
been drawn from the IMF derived from field stars in the solar neighborhood.
These results apply only to gross characterizations of the IMF (e.g. the ratio
of high to low mass stars); present observations do not rule out more subtle
regional differences. Further studies are required in order to assess whether
or not there is evidence for a universal turnover near the hydrogen--burning
limit. We also provide a general framework for discussing theories of the IMF,
and summarize recent work on several physical mechanisms which could play a
role in determining the form of the stellar initial mass function.

clouds' structure and large mosaics of the HI sky allow us to link individual
concentrations to larger structures (such as the Magellanic Clouds and the

HVCs cannot be uniformly assigned a single origin scenario, and must be

simulations reaching steady state in a cold gas with negligible fluid pressure,
in an axisymmetric geometry, using a modification of the Zeus3D code adapted to
parallel computers. The number of boundary conditions imposed at the coronal
base takes into account the existence of the fast and Alfvenic critical
surfaces, avoiding over-determination of the flow. The size and shape of the
computational box is chosen to include these critical surfaces, reducing the
influence of the outer boundary conditions. As there is a region, near the
origin, where the inclination of field lines to the axis is too small to drive
a centrifugal wind, we inject a thin, axial jet, expected to form
electromagnetically near black holes. Acceleration and collimation appear for
wide generic conditions. A reference run is shown in detail, with a wind
leaving the computational volume in the axial direction with a poloidal
velocity equal to 4 times the poloidal Alfven speed, collimated inside 11
degrees. Finally, the critical surfaces, fieldlines, thrust, energy, torque and
mass discharge of the outgoing wind are shown for simulations with various
profiles of mass and magnetic flux at the base of the corona.

either a positive or negative sign with a probability $p$. Such path sums $J$
have been used to model interference effects by hopping electrons in the
strongly localized regime. The advantage of hierarchical lattices is that they
include path crossings, ignored by mean field approaches, while still
permitting analytical treatment. Here, we perform a scaling analysis of the
controversial ``sign transition'' using Monte Carlo sampling, and conclude that
the transition exists and is second order. Furthermore, we make use of exact
moment recursion relations to find that the moments $<J^n>$ always determine,
uniquely, the probability distribution $P(J)$. We also derive, exactly, the
moment behavior as a function of $p$ in the thermodynamic limit. Extrapolations
($n\to 0$) to obtain $<\ln J>$ for odd and even moments yield a new signal for
the transition that coincides with Monte Carlo simulations. Analysis of high
moments yield interesting ``solitonic'' structures that propagate as a function
of $p$. Finally, we derive the exact probability distribution for path sums $J$
up to length L=64 for all sign probabilities.
