during the first part of its outburst in 1975. We have revisited the available
data and find for the first time evidence that the source exhibited multiple
jet ejections. Rapid radio spectral changes indicate the addition of at least
three new components which are initially optically thick. From single baseline
interferometry taken about three weeks after the start of the X-ray outburst we
find that the source is extended on arcsec scales and infer a relativistic
expansion velocity. Some of the other (soft) X-ray transients, such as GS
1124-68 and GS 2000+25, show very similar X-ray outburst light curve shapes to
that of A0620-00, while their radio outburst light curve shapes are different.
We suggest that this is due to the radio emission being strongly beamed in
outburst, whereas the X-ray emission remains isotropic. Since this effect is
stronger at higher jet velocities, this strengthens our conclusion that the
jets in A0620-00 and other soft X-ray transients move with relativistic speeds.

The model is axisymmetric and stationary, and now includes Poynting flux.
Compared to an earlier version of the model, this addition produces faster and
more collimated outflows. Moreover the luminosity needed for the radiative
heating is smaller. The model has been applied to both low and high mass
protostars. Monte Carlo methods have been used to explore systematically the
parameter space. An inflow/outflow pattern including collimation of high speed
material and an infalling toroidal disc arises naturally. The disc shape
depends on the imposed heating, but it is naturally Keplerian given the central
point mass. Outflows can have large opening angles, that increase when magnetic
field weakens. Massive protostars produce faster but less collimated outflows
than less massive protostars. The model is now at a stage where synthetic CO
spectra reproduce very well the observational features. The results strengthen
the idea that radiative heating and Poynting flux are ultimately the energy
sources driving the outflow.

$\Omega$ and the polytropic constant $Q$ as a function of the magnetic

that flows near the galaxy has a velocity of ~ 500 km/s and exerts insufficient
ram pressure on the extraplanar gas to perturb its kinematics. We consider
several explanations of the velocity field of the extraplanar gas. Velocities,
especially blueshifted velocities on the N side of the galaxy, are best
explained as a bipolar outflow which is tilted by > 12 degrees from the normal
to the disk. The observed offset between the extraplanar gas and the radio

the halo gas. Velocity substructure in the outflowing gas also suggests an
interaction with ambient halo gas.

inefficiencies in planetary core formation, all suggest that there was once a
residual planetesimal disk of mass 10-100 Earth-masses in the vicinity of the
giant planets following their formation. Since removal of this disk requires an
exchange of orbital energy and angular momentum with the planets, significant
planetary migration can ensue. The planet migration phenomenon is examined
numerically by evolving the orbits of the giant planets while they are embedded
in a planetesimal disk having a mass of M_d=10 to 200 Earth-masses. We find
that Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune evolve radially outwards as they scatter the
planetesimals, while Jupiter's orbit shrinks as it ejects mass. Higher-mass
disks result in more rapid and extensive planet migration. If orbit expansion
and resonance trapping by Neptune is invoked to explain the eccentricities of
Pluto and its cohort of Kuiper Belt Objects at Neptune's 3:2 mean-motion
resonance, then our simulations suggest that a disk mass of order M_d~50
Earth-masses is required to expand Neptune's orbit by ~7 AU in order to pump up
Plutino eccentricities to e~0.3. Such planet migration implies that the initial
Solar System was more compact in the past, with the Jupiter-Neptune separation
having been smaller by about 30%. The planetesimal disk is also the source of
the Oort Cloud of comets. Using the results of our simulations together with a
simple treatment of Oort Cloud dynamics, we estimate that ~12 Earth-masses of
disk material was initially deposited in the Oort Cloud, of which ~4
Earth-masses will persist over the age of the Solar System. The majority of

luminosity density of galaxies, we use an updated isochrone synthesis model
which takes metallicity variations into account. The computed SFR and the
UV-luminosity density have a steep rise from z=0 to 1, a moderate plateau
between z=1 - 3, and a gradual decrease beyond z=3. The raw calculated results
are significantly above the observed luminosity density, which can be explained
either by dust extinction or the possibly inappropriate input parameters of the
simulation. We model the dust extinction by introducing a parameter f; the
fraction of the total stellar luminosity (not galaxy population) that is
heavily obscured and thus only appears in the far-infrared to sub-millimeter
wavelength range. When we correct our input parameters, and apply dust
extinction with f=0.65, the resulting luminosity density fits various
observations reasonably well, including the present stellar mass density, the
local B-band galaxy luminosity density, and the FIR-to-submm extragalactic
background. Our result is consistent with the picture that \sim 2/3 of the
total stellar emission is heavily obscured by dust and observed only in the
FIR. The rest of the emission is only moderately obscured which can be observed
in the optical to near-IR wavelength range. We also argue that the steep
falloff of the SFR from z=1 to 0 is partly due to the shock-heating of the
universe at late times, which produces gas which is too hot to easily condense
into star-forming regions.

characterized by a low ionization level (with particular ly weak
HeII$\lambda$4686 emission) and is spatially associated with the radio lobe,
the narrow component is characterized by a higher ionization level and extends
well beyond the radio lobe. Crucially, we measure a higher electron temperature
for the broad component (T \sim 30,000 K) than for the narrow component (T \sim
15,000 K). The general line ratios and physical conditions of the two
components are consistent with a model in which the broad component r epresents
gas cooling behind the shock front driven by the radio jets, while the narrow
component represents the AGN- or shock-photoionized precursor gas. However,
uncertainties remain about the gas acceleration mechanism behind the shock
front: unless the radio components are expanding unusually fast in this source,
it is likely that entrainment of the warm clouds in the hot post-shock wind or
radio plasma is required.
  The similarities between the kinematic properties of PKS2250-41 and some high

been resolved in the more distant objects. Given the evidence that the emission

stop mass squared or a severe fine-tuning in order to avoid the FCNC problem.
Recently, it was pointed out that the F-term contribution of the dilaton field
can dominate the flavor-dependent contribution from the anomalous U(1) D-term,
so that the FCNC problem may be naturally avoided. In this paper, we study the
case in which the dilaton is stabilized by the deformation of the K\""ahler

$eG_F^2\tilde{\delta}(4\pi)^{-4}m_{u(d)}m_t^2m_b^2m_H^{-2}$ for the up (down)

explains how it is related to the general form of Yukawa couplings in a

a subgroup of GL_d(Z_{\ell}). However, this does not remain true if we replace
general linear groups by symplectic groups. We say that G is a group of inertia
type if G is a finite group which has a normal Sylow-p-subgroup with cyclic
quotient. We show that if \ell>d+1, and G is a subgroup of Sp_{2d}(Q_{\ell}) of
inertia type, then G is conjugate in GL_{2d}(Q_{\ell}) to a subgroup of
\Sp_{2d}(Z_{\ell}). Despite the fact that G can fail to be conjugate in
\GL_{2d}(Q_\ell) to a subgroup of \Sp_{2d}(Z_\ell), we prove that it can
nevertheless be embedded in \Sp_{2d}(F_\ell) in such a way that the
characteristic polynomials are preserved (mod \ell), as long as \ell>3. The
latter result holds for arbitrary finite groups, not necessarily of inertia
type, and holds also for symmetric forms, not just alternating forms. We give
examples which show that the bounds are sharp. We apply these results to
construct, for every odd prime \ell, isogeny classes of abelian varieties all
of whose polarizations have degree divisible by \ell.

Rueda, and H. Puthoff (which we modified and called Quantum Inertia). Quantum
Inertia states that classical Newtonian Inertia is a property of matter due to
the strictly local electrical force interactions of each of the (electrically
charged) elementary particles of the mass (masseon particles) with the
surrounding (electrically charged) virtual particles (virtual masseons) of the
quantum vacuum. The sum of all the tiny electrical forces (photon exchanges
with the vacuum particles) that originate in each charged elementary particle
of the accelerated mass is the source of the total inertial force of a mass
which opposes accelerated motion in Newton's law 'F = MA'. We invoked
Einstein's principle of equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass to
understand the origin of gravitational mass from the perspective of quantum
inertia. We found that gravity also involves the same 'inertial' electrical
force component that exists in inertial mass. We propose that Einstein's
general relativistic Weak Equivalence Principle originates from common 'lower
level' quantum vacuum processes occurring in both gravitational mass and
inertial mass in accordance with the principles of quantum field theory.
