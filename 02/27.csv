exhibit epochal evolution---a dynamical behavior, commonly observed in both
natural and artificial evolutionary processes, in which long periods of stasis
in an evolving population are punctuated by sudden bursts of change. Our
approach---statistical dynamics---combines methods from both statistical
mechanics and dynamical systems theory in a way that offers an alternative to
current ``landscape'' models of evolutionary optimization. We describe the
population dynamics on the macroscopic level of fitness classes or phenotype
subbasins, while averaging out the genotypic variation that is consistent with
a macroscopic state. Metastability in epochal evolution occurs solely at the
macroscopic level of the fitness distribution. While a balance between
selection and mutation maintains a quasistationary distribution of fitness,
individuals diffuse randomly through selectively neutral subbasins in genotype
space. Sudden innovations occur when, through this diffusion, a genotypic
portal is discovered that connects to a new subbasin of higher fitness
genotypes. In this way, we identify innovations with the unfolding and
stabilization of a new dimension in the macroscopic state space. The
architectural view of subbasins and portals in genotype space clarifies how
frozen accidents and the resulting phenotypic constraints guide the evolution
to higher complexity.

material over this range of velocity appears to fully occult the continuum
source, the broad emission line region, and any material that could give rise
to scattered light. In view of a unified scenario for BAL and Mini-BAL

explained if the BAL flow has an unusual geometry compared to the population of

The power spectrum of XTE J1806-246 on this curved branch consisted of a power
law and a cutoff power law component. The presence of these components and
their dependence on position of the source on the branch is also identical to
the behavior of atoll sources on the banana branch. Near the end of it outburst
XTE J1806-246 formed patches in the color-color diagram, the spectrum was
harder, and the power spectrum showed strong band limited noise, characteristic
of the atoll sources in the island state. A second pattern was traced out

structure which we interpret as formed by two distinct branches. This pattern
resembles the normal-flaring branches of the high-luminosity neutron star LMXBs

strengthens this similarity. We conclude that if XTE J1806-246 is a neutron
star, it is most likely an atoll source that only at the peak of its outburst
reached a luminosity level sufficiently high to show the type of QPO that Z
sources who on their normal and flaring branches.

contain a rather general helical magnetic field. We address the stability of
our models to gravitational fragmentation and axisymmetric MHD-driven
instabilities. By calculating the dominant modes of axisymmetric instability,
we determine the dominant length scales and growth rates for fragmentation. We
find that the role of pressure truncation is to decrease the growth rate of
gravitational instabilities by decreasing the self-gravitating mass per unit
length. Purely poloidal and toroidal fields also help to stabilize filamentary
clouds against fragmentation. The overall effect of helical fields is to
stabilize gravity-driven modes, so that the growth rates are significantly
reduced below what is expected for unmagnetized clouds. However, MHD
``sausage'' instabilities are triggered in models whose toroidal flux to mass
ratio exceeds the poloidal flux to mass ratio by more than a factor of $\sim
2$. We find that observed filaments appear to lie in a physical regime where
the growth rates of both gravitational fragmentation and axisymmetric
MHD-driven modes are at a minimum.

the signals provided the necessary time to communicate the trigger across the

0.6 GHz, implying an emission mechanism bandwidth of at least 0.8 GHz at 1 GHz
for pulse structure on time scales of one to ten microseconds.
  The arrival times at both frequencies display a jitter of 100 microseconds

from the central population of high-mass stars (the OB association LH 114). We

in [SII] emission compared to its H-alpha and [N II] emission. The measured
intensity ratios in N70 more closely match the range of excitation spanned by
giant and supergiant H II shells and even by some of the supernova remnants

combination of photoionization plus collisional ionization and excitation of
sulfur atoms by low-velocity shocks is driving the emission-line luminosities

one or two supernova explosions having occurred during the last ~Myr.

that the magnification bias is moderate in the absence of the power-law tail in

considerable, especially at the bright end of the luminosity functions.

modified recursive Green's function algorithm. Our results confirm the validity
of a previous approach based on the WKB approximation for a long constriction,
but find an enhancement of cohesion for shorter constrictions. Surprisingly,
the cohesion persists even after the last conductance channel has been closed.
For disordered nanowires, a statistical analysis yields well-defined peaks in
the conductance histograms even when individual conductance traces do not show
well-defined plateaus. The shifts of the peaks below integer multiples of
$2e^2/h$, as well as the peak heights and widths, are found to be in excellent
agreement with predictions based on random matrix theory, and are similar to
those observed experimentally. Thus abrupt changes in the wire geometry are not
necessary for reproducing the observed conductance histograms. The effect of
disorder on cohesion is found to be quite strong and very sensitive to the
particular configuration of impurities at the center of the constriction.

the dual frame, is a `holographic' frame. The radial coordinate of adS_{p+2}
provides a UV/IR connection as in the case of the D3 brane. The gravitational
description involves gauged supergravities, typically with non-compact gauge

Julia sets and of many points of the Mandelbrot set; local connectivity has
many interesting implications. The intention of this paper is to present a new
point of view for this problem: we introduce fibers of these sets, and the goal
becomes to show that fibers are ``trivial'', i.e. they consist of single
points. The idea is to show ``shrinking of puzzle pieces'' without using
specific puzzles. This implies local connectivity at these points, but
triviality of fibers is a somewhat stronger property than local connectivity.
Local connectivity proofs in holomorphic dynamics often actually yield that
fibers are trivial, and this extra knowledge is sometimes useful.
  Since we believe that fibers may be useful in further situations, we discuss
their properties for arbitrary compact connected and full sets in the complex
plane. This allows to use them for connected filled-in Julia sets of
polynomials, and polynomials of the form $z^d+c$ have the property that the
impression of any dynamic ray at a rational angle is a single point. An
appendix reviews known topological properties of compact, connected and full
sets in the plane.
  The definition of fibers grew out of a new brief proof that the Mandelbrot
set is locally connected at every Misiurewicz point and at every point on the
boundary of a hyperbolic component. This proof works also for ``Multibrot
sets'', which are the higher degree cousins of the Mandelbrot set. These sets
are discussed in a self-contained sequel (IMS Preprint 1998/13a). Finally, we
relate triviality of fibers to tuning and renormalization in IMS Preprint
1998/13b.

The idea is to show ``shrinking of puzzle pieces'' without using specific

fibers of certain points are ``trivial'', i.e., they consist of single points.
This implies local connectivity at these points.
  Locally, triviality of fibers is strictly stronger than local connectivity.
Local connectivity proofs in holomorphic dynamics often actually yield that
fibers are trivial, and this extra knowledge is sometimes useful. We include
the proof that local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set implies density of
hyperbolicity in the space of quadratic polynomials.
  We write our proofs more generally for Multibrot sets, which are the loci of
connected Julia sets for polynomials of the form $z\mapsto z^d+c$.

written so as to be independent of the discussion of fibers of general compact

sets in terms of fibers which was begun in IMS preprints 1998/12 and 1998/13a.
The question of local connectivity of these sets is discussed in terms of
fibers and becomes the question of triviality of fibers. In this paper, the
focus is on the behavior of fibers under renormalization and other surgery
procedures. We show that triviality of fibers of Mandelbrot and Multibrot sets
is preserved under tuning maps and other (partial) homeomorphisms. Similarly,
we show for unicritical polynomials that triviality of fibers of Julia sets is
preserved under renormalization and other surgery procedures, such as the
Branner-Douady homeomorphisms. We conclude with various applications about
quadratic polynomials and its parameter space: we identify embedded paths
within the Mandelbrot set, and we show that Petersen's theorem about quadratic
Julia sets with Siegel disks of bounded type generalizes from period one to
arbitrary periods so that they all have trivial fibers and are thus locally
connected.

result and prove that diffeomorphisms having only hyperbolic periodic points

simpler than the original proof of Artin-Mazur. The second main result is that
the A-M property is not (Baire) generic. Moreover, in a Newhouse domain ${\cal

dialogues as psycholinguistic phenomena and the unraveling of a hidden dialogue
structure of 2-person differential interactive games. In the field-theoretic
description of interactive games the dialogues are defined naively as
interactive games of discrete time with intention fields of continuous time;
the correct mathematical formulation is proposed. The states and the controls
of a dialogue correspond to the speech whereas the intention fields describe
the understanding. In the case of dialogues the main inverse problem is to
describe geometrical and algebraical properties of the understanding. On the
other hand, a precise mathematical definition of dialogues allows to formulate
a problem of the unraveling of a hidden dialogue structure of any 2-person
differential interactive game. Such procedure is called the verbalization. It
means that the states of a differential interactive game are interpreted as
intention fields of a hidden dialogue and the problem is to describe such
dialogue completely. If a 2-person differential interactive game is
verbalizable one is able to consider many linguistic (e.g. the formal grammar
of a related hidden dialogue) or psycholinguistic (e.g. the dynamical
correlation of various implications) aspects of it.
