we live in an open universe. We examine the implications for the future under
these assumptions, and find that they are striking. If the Universe is
cosmological constant-dominated, our ability to probe the evolution of large
scale structure will decrease with time ---presently observable distant sources
will disappear on a time-scale comparable to the period of stellar burning.
Moreover, while the Universe might expand forever, the integrated conscious
lifetime of any civilization will be finite, although it can be astronomically
long. We find that this latter result is far more general. In the absence of
possible exotic and uncertain strong gravitational effects, the total
information recoverable by any civilization over the entire history of our
universe is finite, and assuming that consciousness has a physical
computational basis, life cannot be eternal.

971227 with the Livermore Optical Transient Imaging System (LOTIS). LOTIS began
imaging the `Original' BATSE error box of GRB 971227 approximately 14 s after
the onset of gamma-ray emission. Continuous monitoring of the position
throughout the evening yielded a total of 499 images (10 s integration).
Analysis of these images revealed no steady optical afterglow brighter than
R=12.3 +- 0.2 in any single image. Coaddition of different combinations of the
LOTIS images also failed to uncover transient optical emission. In particular,
assuming a constant early time flux, no optical afterglow brighter than R=14.2
+- 0.2 was present within the first 1200 s and no optical afterglow brighter
than R=15.0 +- 0.2 was present in the first 6.0 h.
  Follow up observations by other groups revealed a likely X-ray afterglow and
a possible optical afterglow. Although subsequent deeper observations could not
confirm a fading source, we show that these transients are not inconsistent
with our present knowledge of the characteristics of GRB afterglows. We also
demonstrate that with the upgraded thermoelectrically cooled CCDs, LOTIS is
capable of either detecting very early time optical afterglow or placing
stringent constraints on the relationship between the gamma-ray emission and
the longer wavelength afterglow in relativistic blast wave models.

studies the growth was investigated at the small particle number densities
typical for the conditions in a proto-planetary disc. Under such circumstances,
the mean particle distance exceeds the typical aggregate diameter by orders of
magnitude, and a collision will be a very rare event. We derived a criterion
which allows an efficient detection of candidates for imminent collisions. The
N-particle-method we used is based upon an adaptive time step scheme respecting
the individual dynamical states of the aggregates. Its basic concept is to
perform on average constant ``length steps'', instead of using constant time
steps. The numerical cost of the algorithm scales with the particle number
better than N log N. In order to minimise the influence of the decreasing
number of particles within the simulation box, a new rescaling method is used
throughout the aggregation process. Our numerical results indicate that at very
low number densities, the growth process is influenced by spatial number
density fluctuations.

NGC 383 galaxy group based on ROSAT PSPC and HRI data. X-ray emission can be
traced out to ~ 1 Mpc, the estimated virial radius of the system. We determine
a total mass of 6x10^{13} M_sun for the group inside this radius with a gas
mass fraction of 21%. The intragroup-gas temperature of 1.5 keV is both
consistent with the galaxy velocity dispersion and the X-ray
luminosity-temperature relation of groups and clusters suggesting that the
group is fairly relaxed. This is also indicated by the almost spherically
symmetric appearance of the group's X-ray halo.
  The X-ray properties of the radio galaxy NGC 383 (3C 31) which is located
near the center of the group are discussed. Its spectrum is best described by a
two-component model, consisting of emission from a low-temperature
Raymond-Smith plasma, and a hard tail. The possible interaction of the radio
jets of 3C 31 with the IGM is studied.
  A spatial, spectral and temporal analysis of the Einstein source 1E0104+3153
located within the field of view is performed, one goal being the
identification of the optical counterpart (with both, a high-redshift BAL
quasar and a nearby elliptical galaxy, member of a small group, located within
the Einstein X-ray error circle). We find evidence that the IGM of the small
group contributes significantly to the X-ray emission of 1E0104, which can be
described by a Raymond-Smith model of kT ~ 2 keV and a soft X-ray luminosity of

magnetic brane, but is unstable against certain modes of separation of several

possible CA 'motion'). Minkowski 4D flat space-time of special relativity can

  Comments welcome, E-Mail: emqg@rogerswave.ca",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  On a new approach to quantum gravity called Electro-Magnetic Quantum Gravity
(EMQG) which is manifestly compatible with Cellular Automata (CA) theory and is
based on a new theory of inertia (ref. 5) proposed by R. Haisch, A. Rueda, and
H. Puthoff (which we modified and called Quantum Inertia). Newtonian Inertia is
due to the strictly local electrical force interactions of matter with the
surrounding charged virtual particles of the quantum vacuum. The sum of all the
tiny electrical forces originating from each charged particle in the mass with
respect to the vacuum, is the source of the total inertial force of a mass
which opposes accelerated motion in Newton's law 'F = MA'. The problems and
paradoxes of accelerated motion introduced in Mach's principle are solved by
suggesting that the state of acceleration of the charged virtual particles of
the quantum vacuum (with respect to a mass) serves as Newton's universal
reference frame for the mass. Einstein's principle of equivalence of inertial
and gravitational mass was invoked to understand the origin of gravitational
mass from the perspective of quantum inertia. We found that gravity also
involves the same 'inertial' electromagnetic force component that exists for
inertial mass. Therfore, we propose that the Weak Equivalence Principle is a
physical phenomenon originating from common 'lower level' quantum processes
occurring in both gravitational mass and inertial mass.

physics of this century, we identify its limitations for the treatment of
systems beyond the local-differential, Hamiltonian and canonical-unitary
conditions of the original conception. We therefore outline three sequential
generalized mathematics introduced by the author under the name of iso-, geno-
and hyper-mathematics which are based on generalized, Hermitean, non-Hermitean
and multi-valued units, respectively. The resulting iso-, geno- and hyper-Lie
theories, for which the new mathematics were submitted, have been extensively
used for the description of nonlocal-integral systems with action-at-a-distance
Hamiltonian and short-range-contact non-Hamiltonian interactions in reversible,
irreversible and multi-valued conditions, respectively. We then point out that
conventional, iso-, geno- and hyper-Lie theories are unable to provide a
consistent classical representation of antimatter yielding the correct charge
conjugate states at the operator counterpart. We therefore outline yet novel
mathematics proposed by the author under the names of isodual conventional,
iso-, geno- and hyper-mathematics, which constitute anti-isomorphic images of
the original mathematics characterized by negative-definite units and norms.
The emerging isodual generalizations of Lie's theory have permitted a novel
consistent characterization of antimatter at all levels of study, from Newton
to second quantization. The main message emerging after three decades of
investigations is that the sole generalized theories as invariant as the
original formulation, the sole usable in physics, are those preserving the
original abstract Lie axioms, and merely realizing them in broader forms.
