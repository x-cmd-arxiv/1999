Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02567.x",,"astro-ph",,"  This paper examines a new class of exact and self-consistent MHD solutions
which describe steady and axisymmetric hydromagnetic outflows from the
atmosphere of a magnetized and rotating central object with possibly an
orbiting accretion disk. The plasma is driven against gravity by a thermal
pressure gradient, as well as by magnetic rotator and radiative forces. At the
Alfvenic and fast critical points the appropriate criticality conditions are
applied. The outflow starts almost radially but after the Alfven transition and
before the fast critical surface is encountered the magnetic pinching force
bends the poloidal streamlines into a cylindrical jet-type shape. The terminal
speed, Alfven number, cross-sectional area of the jet, as well as its final
pressure and density obtain uniform values at large distances from the source.
The goal of the study is to give an analytical discussion of the
two-dimensional interplay of the thermal pressure gradient, gravitational,
Lorentz and inertial forces in accelerating and collimating an MHD flow. A
parametric study of the model is also given, as well as a brief sketch of its
applicability to a self-consistent modelling of collimated outflows from
various astrophysical objects. {The analysed model succeeds to give for the
first time an exact and self-consistent MHD solution for jet-type outflows
extending from the stellar surface to infinity where it can be superfast, in
agreement with the MHD causality principle.

by various investigators. We respond by (1) examining each of the challenges
presented and (2) presenting new photometric and spectroscopic data. We
conclude that although the CMD data do not mandate the existence of a
foreground population, they are entirely consistent with a foreground
population associated with the LMC that contributes significantly (~ 50%) to
the observed microlensing optical depth. From our new data, we conclude that <~
40% of the VRC stars are young, massive red clump stars because (1) synthetic
color-magnitude diagrams created using the star formation history derived
indepdently from HST data suggest that < 50% of the VRC stars are young,
massive red clump stars, (2) the angular distribution of the VRC stars is more
uniform than that of the young (age < 1 Gyr) main sequence stars, and (3) the
velocity dispersion of the VRC stars in the region of the LMC examined by ZL is
inconsistent with the expectation for a young disk population. Each of these
arguments is predicated on assumptions and the conclusions are uncertain.
Therefore, an exact determination of the contribution to the microlensing
optical depth by the various hypothesized foreground populations, and the
subsequent conclusions regarding the existence of halo MACHOs, requires a
detailed knowledge of many complex astrophysical issues, such as the IMF, star

the lensed source images. Most of them are difficult objects for ground-based

Seven are ``strong lens'' candidates which appear to have multiple images of

what extent foreground contamination may affect Planck's ability to accurately
determine cosmological parameters. Planck's multifrequency surveys will be
unique in their coverage of large areas of the sky (actually, of the full sky);
this will extend by two or more orders of magnitude the flux density interval
over which mm/sub-mm counts of extragalactic sources can be determined by
instruments already available (like SCUBA) or planned for the next decade (like
the LSA-MMA or the space mission FIRST), which go much deeper but over very
limited areas. Planck will thus provide essential complementary information on
the epoch-dependent luminosity functions. Bright radio sources will be studied
over a poorly explored frequency range where spectral signatures, essential to
understand the physical processes that are going on, show up. The
Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, with its extremely rich information content, will be
observed in the direction of a large number of rich clusters of Galaxies.
Thanks again to its all sky coverage, Planck will provide unique information on
the structure and on the emission properties of the interstellar medium in the
Galaxy. At the same time, the foregrounds are unlikely to substantially limit
Planck's ability to measure the cosmological signals. Even measurements of
polarization of the primordial Cosmic Microwave background fluctuations appear
to be feasible.

expected to vanish, as a consequence of the fact that in this case the average
length <l> diverges, thereby breaking the balance between determinism and
randomness in favor of determinism. In the region mu > 2 the entropic index q
seems to depend on mu through the power law expression q = (mu-2)^(alpha) with

hydrodynamic merging of compact binaries. Analytic analyses of the inspiral
waveforms have been performed in the Post-Newtonian approximation. Analytic and
numerical treatments of the coalescence waveforms from binary neutron stars
have been performed using Newtonian hydrodynamics and the quadrupole radiation
approximation. Numerical simulations of coalescing black hole and neutron star
binaries are also underway in full general relativity. Recent results from each
of these approaches will be described and their virtues and limitations

elementary fields are calculated. In the component formulation it is shown that
the choice of the Wess-Zumino gauge, that is standard in supersymmetric gauge
theories, introduces ultraviolet divergences in the propagators at the one-loop
level. Such divergences are exactly cancelled when the contributions of the
fields that are put to zero in the Wess-Zumino gauge are taken into account. In
the description in terms of N=1 superfields infrared divergences are found for
every choice of gauge different from the supersymmetric generalization of the

are computed and some general features of the infrared problem are discussed.
We also examine the effect of the introduction of mass terms for the (anti)
chiral superfields in the theory, which break supersymmetry from N=4 to N=1. It
is shown that in the mass deformed model no ultraviolet divergences appear in
two-point functions. It argued that this result can be generalized to n-point
functions, supporting the proposal of a possible of use of this modified model

  C, 1999","Pramana56:723-734,2001","10.1007/s12043-001-0073-1",,"nucl-th",,"  The formalism developed by Jain and Kundu for the propagation of a resonance
in the nuclear medium has been modified to the case of heavy-ion collisions at
relativistic energies. The formalism includes coherently the contribution to
the observed di-lepton production from the decay of the resonance inside as
well as outside the nuclear medium. The calculated results are presented for
the $\rho $-meson production. It is observed that, in general, the shape,
magnitude and peak position of the coherently summed invariant mass
distribution is much different from that obtained by summing the inside and
outside contributions incoherently. Therefore, while inferring the modification
of hadron properties produced in heavy-ion collisions from experiments, it is
important that in theoretical calculations one includes the decay of the
propagating hadron from inside and outside the heavy-ion system coherently. We
also find that the mass distribution is sensitive to the amount of the medium
modification of the $\rho $-meson.

transformations, which can be interpreted to result from a Turing-head
(pseudo-spin $S$) rotating along a closed Turing-tape ($M$ additional
pseudo-spins). The dynamical evolution of the Bloch-vector of $S$, which can be
decomposed into $2^{M}$ primitive pure state Turing-head trajectories, gives
rise to fascinating geometrical patterns reflecting the entanglement between
head and tape. These machines thus provide intuitive examples for quantum
parallelism and, at the same time, means for local testing of quantum network
dynamics.

that the protocol produces, with non-zero probability, a state of maximal
possible entanglement of formation. This defines a new entanglement measure,
the maximum extractable entanglement.

possible for a party possessing half of a pure bipartite quantum state to
transfer some of his entanglement with the other party to a third party. We
describe the unitary local transformation for symmetric and isotropic splitting
of a singlet into two branches that leads to the highest entanglement of the
output. The capacity of the resulting quantum channels is discussed. Using the
same transformation for less than maximally entangled pure states, the
entanglement of the resulting states is found. We discuss whether they can be
used to do teleportation and to test the Bell inequality. Finally we generalize
to entanglement splitting into more than two branches.
