  14--15 1998, Princeton NJ",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Improved knowledge of diffuse Galactic emission is important to maximize the
scientific return from scheduled CMB anisotropy missions. Cross-correlation of
microwave maps with maps of the far-IR dust continuum show a ubiquitous
microwave emission component whose spatial distribution is traced by far-IR
dust emission. The spectral index of this emission, beta_{radio} = -2.2 (+0.5
-0.7) is suggestive of free-free emission but does not preclude other
candidates. Comparison of H-alpha and microwave results show that both data
sets have positive correlations with the far-IR dust emission. Microwave data,
however, are consistently brighter than can be explained solely from free-free
emission traced by H-alpha. This ``anomalous'' microwave emission can be
explained as electric dipole radiation from small spinning dust grains. The
anomalous component at 53 GHz is 2.5 times as bright as the free-free emission
traced by H-alpha, providing an approximate normalization for models with
significant spinning dust emission.

blackhole mass has been determined from the Doppler velocities of water maser.
We show that the standard $\alpha$-disk model of NGC 1068 gives disk mass
between the radii of 0.65 pc and 1.1 pc (the region from which water maser
emission is detected) to be about 7x10$^7$ M$_\odot$ (for $\alpha=0.1$), more
than four times the blackhole mass, and a Toomre Q-parameter for the disk is
$\sim$0.001. This disk is therefore highly self-gravitating and is subject to
large-amplitude density fluctuations. We conclude that the standard
$\alpha$-viscosity description for the structure of the accretion disk is
invalid for NGC 1068.
  In this paper we develop a new model for the accretion disk. The disk is
considered to be composed of gravitationally bound clumps; accretion in this
clumped disk model arises because of gravitational interaction of clumps with
each other and the dynamical frictional drag exerted on clumps from the stars
in the central region of the galaxy. The clumped disk model provides a
self-consistent description of the observations of NGC 1068. The computed
temperature and density are within the allowed parameter range for water maser
emission, and the rotational velocity in the disk falls off as $r^{-0.35}$.

problem leading to numerous cancellations the range of validity of the LLL
approximation in mean field is much wider then a naive range and extends all
the way down to $H = {H_{c2}(T)}/13$. Moreover the contribution of higher
Landau levels is significantly smaller compared to LLL than expected naively.
We show that like the LLL part the lattice excitation spectrum at small
quasimomenta is softer than that of usual acoustic phonons. This enhanses the
effect of fluctuations. The mean field calculation extends to third order,
while the fluctuation contribution due to HLL is to one loop. This complements
the earlier calculation of the LLL part to two loop order.

In the mixed state the behavior of both systems is quite similar. The scaling

degree of disorder and can be varied by annealing. This is attributed to a
variation of the strength of flux pinning. In the normal state weakly
temperature dependent Hall coefficients were observed for both compounds. A
distinct nonlinearity in the \rho_{xy} dependence on field H was found for
LuNi_2B_2C in the normal state below 40K, accompanied by a large

semiclassical gravity and suggest directions for further investigations. This
theory generalizes the semiclassical Einstein equation to an Einstein-Langevin
equation with a stochastic source term arising from the fluctuations of the
energy-momentum tensor of quantum fields. We mention recent efforts in applying
this theory to the study of black hole fluctuations and backreaction problems,
linear response of hot flat space, and structure formation in inflationary
cosmology. To explore the physical meaning and implications of this stochastic
regime in relation to both classical and quantum gravity, we find it useful to
take the view that semiclassical gravity is mesoscopic physics and that general
relativity is the hydrodynamic limit of certain spacetime quantum
substructures. Three basic issues - stochasticity, collectivity, correlations-
and three processes - dissipation, fluctuations, decoherence- underscore the
transformation from quantum micro structure and interaction to the emergence of
classical macro structure and dynamics. We discuss ways to probe into the high
energy activity from below and make two suggestions: via effective field theory
and the correlation hierarchy. We discuss how stochastic behavior at low energy
in an effective theory and how correlation noise associated with coarse-grained
higher correlation functions in an interacting quantum field could carry
nontrivial information about the high energy sector. Finally we describe
processes deemed important at the Planck scale, including tunneling and pair
creation, wave scattering in random geometry, growth of fluctuations and forms,
Planck scale resonance states, and spacetime foams.

the observed asymmetry can be produced for a wide range of reheating

  To be published in Proceedings",,,"NUTP-9901","hep-ph",,"  In this paper the phase structure of the massive $\lambda \phi^4$ model at
finite temperature ($T \neq 0$) is investigated by applying a resummation
method inspired by the renormalization-group (RG) improvement to the one-loop
effective potential. The resummation method a la RG-improvement is shown to
work quite succesfully by resumming up systematically large correction-terms of
$O(\lambda T/\mu)$ and of $O(\lambda (T/\mu)^2)$. The temperature-dependent
phase transition of the model is shown to proceed through the second order
transition. The critical exponents are determined analytically and are compared
with those in other analyses.

approximate 1/|x| for large x but which are finite at the origin. These
functions arise naturally in the study of atoms in strong magnetic fields where
the so-called ""Landau states"" give rise to Gaussian integrals. Generalizations
in which e^{-x^2} is replaced by e^{-x^p} are also considered and approximate
x^{1-p} for large x.
  The limiting behavior and monotonicity properties of these functions are
discussed in terms of parameters which arise in the approximations as well as
x. Several classes of inequalities, some of which provide tight bounds, are
established. Some differential equations and recursion relations satisfied by
these functions are given. The recursion relations give rise to two classes of
polynomials, one of which is related to confluent hypergeometric functions.
Finally, it is shown that the inverse of the approximating function is convex
and this implies an analogue of the triangle inequality. Some comments are made
about possible extensions and several open questions are raised.

The coordinate-free approach is a factorization approach but does not require
the coprime factorizations of the plant. We present two criteria for feedback
stabilizability for MIMO systems in which transfer functions belong to the
total rings of fractions of commutative rings. Both of them are generalizations
of Sule's results in [SIAM J. Control Optim., 32-6, 1675-1695(1994)]. The first
criterion is expressed in terms of modules generated from a causal plant and
does not require the plant to be strictly causal. It shows that if the plant is
stabilizable, the modules are projective. The other criterion is expressed in
terms of ideals called generalized elementary factors. This gives the
stabilizability of a causal plant in terms of the coprimeness of the
generalized elementary factors. As an example, a discrete finite-time delay
system is considered.
