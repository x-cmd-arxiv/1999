anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background, we place constraints on the
angular power spectrum of fluctuations in eight multipole bands up to l ~ 260.
The observed spectrum is consistent with both the COBE experiment and previous
Python results. There is no significant contamination from known foregrounds.
The results show a discernible rise in the angular power spectrum from large (l

disk galaxy through the hot steady-state galactic wind and dust grains
expulsion by stellar radiation pressure. We show that a typical disk galaxy is
nearly as effective in enriching the ICM as an elliptical galaxy of the same
mass. Having estimated the oxygen and iron loss from a single galaxy, we
integrate them over the galactic mass spectrum. We show that the ""effective""
loss (per unit luminosity) from spiral galaxies is comparable to the loss from
ellipticals. The dominant role of early-type galaxies in rich clusters is
caused by that they outnumber spirals.

most importantly being responsible for the self-sustained MHD-turbulence giving
rise to the disc viscosity, and 3) the details of the radiation processes
giving rise to the X/gamma-ray continuum originating close to the black hole.
Some old advances are unfortunately also necessary to discuss here. It is
pointed out to the accretion disc research community, that many of the research
papers published on ADAFs 1994-1997 do not accurately present the history of
ADAF research. Some of the results that were presented as new and original
actually appeared in a paper by Ichimaru already in 1977. Also not quoted are
the papers from the 1970's and 1980's calculating the temperature structure of
and the spectra from quasi-spherical accretion flows onto black holes. As the
ADAFs are close to being quasi-spherical, the resulting spectra of ADAFs and
quasi-spherical flows are almost identical. Further of the recent ADAF results
are therefore not new results as is sometimes claimed. In spite of all the
recent progress of various aspects of accretion flows around black holes, many
of the research lines have still not been merged providing potential for
further dramatic progress in coming years.

region of X-ray emission extending along the central bar of the galaxy,
combined with an emission peak near the centre of the galaxy. This X-ray
emission is centred on the optical/radio nucleus, but is spatially extended.
The X-ray spectrum can be well fitted by a thermal plasma model, with
kT=0.6-0.8keV and a low local absorbing column. The thermal spectrum is
suggestive of starburst emission rather than emission from a central
black-hole.
  The ATCA radio observations show a number of hotspots, located in a ring
around a weak radio nucleus. Synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by
supernovae and supernova remnants (SNRs) is the likely origin of these
hotspots. The radio nucleus has a steep spectrum, indicative perhaps of an AGN
or SNRs. The evidence for a jet emanating from the nucleus is at best marginal.
The extent of the radio ring is comparable to the extended central X-ray
source.

phase space accessible to the models is examined with regard to the main orbit
families. For different orbit energies complete sets of closed orbits are
computed. By projection to the reference frame of the galaxy, artificial
rotation curves for every model are obtained and are compared with the observed

the NGC2336-models are optimized by computing and evaluating a large number of

directed percolation (DP). Anomalous scaling laws appear in the limit of large

discussed in details. As well known the ground state of a given Hamiltonian $H$
can be obtained by applying the imaginary time propagator $e^{-H \tau}$ to a
given trial state $\psi_T$ for large imaginary time $\tau$ and sampling
statistically the propagated state $ \psi_{\tau} = e^{-H \tau} \psi_T$. However
the so called ``sign problem'' may appear in the simulation and such
statistical propagation would be practically impossible without employing some
approximation such as the well known ``fixed node'' approximation (FN). This
method allows to improve the FN dynamic with a systematic correction scheme.
This is possible by the simple requirement that, after a short imaginary time
propagation via the FN dynamic, a number $p$ of correlation functions can be
further constrained to be {\em exact} by small perturbation of the FN
propagated state, which is free of the sign problem. By iterating this scheme
the Monte Carlo average sign, which is almost zero when there is sign problem,
remains stable and finite even for large $\tau$. The proposed algorithm is
tested against the exact diagonalization results available on finite lattice.
It is also shown in few test cases that the dependence of the results upon the
few parameters entering the stochastic technique can be very easily controlled,
unless for exceptional cases.

behavior is investigated through conformal invariance techniques which were

calculations provide a simple test to find the range of disorder amplitudes
which is characteristic of the disordered fixed point. The scaling dimensions
then follow from the exponential decay of correlations along the strip. Monte
Carlo simulations of spin systems on the other hand are generally performed on
systems of rectangular shape on the square lattice, but the data are then
perturbed by strong surface effects. The conformal mapping of a semi-infinite
system inside a square enables us to take into account boundary effects
explicitly and leads to an accurate determination of the scaling dimensions.

Phys",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.60.1081",,"cond-mat.stat-mech",,"  Recent Monte Carlo simulation studies of a Lennard-Jones fluid confined to a
mesoscopic slit-pore have reported evidence for ``critical depletion'' in the
pore local number density near the liquid-vapour critical point. In this note
we demonstrate that the observed depletion effect is in fact a simulation
artifact arising from small systematic errors associated with the use of long
range corrections for the potential truncation. Owing to the large
near-critical compressibility, these errors lead to significant changes in the
pore local number density. We suggest ways of avoiding similar problems in
future studies of confined fluids.

correlations of hadrons produced in Z decays is performed. The study is based
on the data sample of more than 4 million events recorded with the OPAL
detector at LEP. The fluctuations and correlations are analysed in terms of the
normalized scaled factorial moments and cumulants up to the fifth order. The
moments are observed to have intermittency-like behaviour, which is found to be
more pronounced with increasing dimension. The large data sample allows for the
first time a study of the factorial cumulants in e+e- annihilation. The
analysis of the cumulants shows the existence of genuine multiparticle
correlations with a strong intermittency rise up to higher orders. These
correlations are found to be stronger in higher dimensions. The decomposition
of the factorial moments into lower-order correlations shows that the dynamical
fluctuations have important contributions from genuine many-particle
correlations. The Monte Carlo models JETSET 7.4 and HERWIG 5.9 are found to
reproduce the trend of the measured moments and cumulants but they
underestimate the magnitudes. The results are found to be consistent with QCD
jet formation dynamics, although additional contributions from other mechanisms
in the hadronization process cannot be excluded.
