excited to roughly the same amplitude, the sign of angular momentum deposit in
the radiative interior of the Sun is such as to lead to an exponential growth
of any existing small radial gradient of rotation velocity just below the
convection zone. This leads to formation of a strong thin shear layer (of
thickness about 0.3% R_\odot) near the top of the radiative zone of the Sun on
a time-scale of order 20 years. When the magnitude of differential rotation
across this layer reaches about 0.1 \mu Hz, the layer becomes unstable to shear
instability and undergoes mixing, and the excess angular momentum deposited in
the layer is returned to the convection zone. The strong shear in this layer
generates toroidal magnetic field which is also deposited in the convection
zone when the layer becomes unstable. This could possibly start a new magnetic
activity cycle seen at the surface.

of its main advantages over the standard Press-Schechter approximation. We
first check that the two-point correlation functions agree with the
stable-clustering ansatz. Next we show that the statistics of the

turn to mass functions of overdense and underdense regions. We first consider
the mass function of ""just collapsed"" objects defined by a density threshold
$\Delta~177$. We note that the usual Press-Schechter prescription agrees
reasonably well with the simulations (although there are some discrepancies)
while the numerical results are also consistent with the scaling model. Then,
we consider more general mass functions defined by different density thresholds
which can even be negative. This is out of reach of the Press-Schechter
approach while our scaling model can handle these mass functions and it shows a
reasonably good agreement with numerical results. Finally, we consider objects
defined by a constant radius condition. Thus, we find that the scaling model
allows one to study many different classes of objects and it clarifies the

UGC 3995B is in front of the Seyfert-hosting component UGC 3995A, partly
obscuring its western side. The small radial velocity difference leaves the
relative motion of the two galaxies largely unconstrained. The observed lack of
major tidal deformations, along with some morphological peculiarities, suggests
that the galaxies are proximate in space but may have recently approached each
other on the plane of the sky. The geometry of the system and the radial
velocity curve at P. A. = 106 suggest that the encounter may be retrograde or,
alternatively, prograde before perigalacticon. The partial overlap of the two

postshock evolution of the cluster potential produce and how much does it
affect the dispersion of stellar energies. We introduce the adiabatic
correction} as ratio of the energy change, <dE>, to its value in the impulse
approximation. When the potential is kept fixed, the numerical results for the
adiabatic correction for stars with orbital frequency \omega can be
approximated as (1 + \omega^2 \tau^2)^{-\gamma}. For shocks with the
characteristic duration of the order the half-mass dynamical time of the
cluster, \tau < t_{dyn,h}, the exponent \gamma = 5/2. For more prolonged
shocks, \tau > 4 t_{dyn,h}, the adiabatic correction is shallower, \gamma =
3/2. When we allow for self-gravity and potential oscillations which follow the
shock, the energy of stars in the core changes significantly, while the total
energy of the system is conserved. Paradoxically, the postshock potential
fluctuations reduce the total amount of energy dispersion, <dE^2>. The effect
is small but real and is due to the postshock energy change being statistically
anti-correlated with the shock induced heating. These results are to be applied
to Fokker-Planck models of the evolution of globular clusters.

from the mass ($m_o$) in the dielectric coating surrounding the dot. The
electronic structure of the quantum dot is determined in crucial ways by the
mass discontinuity factor $\beta \equiv m_i/m_o$. In this connection we propose
a novel quantum scale, $\sigma$, which is a dimensionless parameter
proportional to $\beta^2 V_0 R^2$, where $V_0$ represents the barrier due to
dielectric coating. The scale $\sigma$ represents a mass modified ``strength''
of the potential. We show both by numerical calculations and asymptotic
analysis that the charge density near the nanocrystallite surface, $\rho (r =
R)$, can be large and scales as $1/\sigma$. This fact suggests a significant
role for the surface in an EMT based model. We also show that the upshift in
the ground state energy is weaker than quadratic, unlike traditional EMT based
calculations, and chart its dependence on the proposed scale $\sigma$. Finally,
we demonstrate that calculations based on our model compare favorably with
valence band photoemission data and with more elaborate theoretical
calculations.

shift, and subleading-logs of all orders needed to restore the Froissart bound
are automatically provided. The main technical difficulty is to find a way to
extract these subleading contributions without having to compute each Feynman
diagram beyond the leading order. We solve that problem by using nonabelian cut
diagrams introduced elsewhere. They can be considered as colour filters used to
isolate the multi-Reggeon contributions that supply these subleading-log terms.
Illustration of the formalism is given for amplitudes and phase shifts up to
three loops. For diffractive scattering, only phase shifts governed by one and
two Reggeon exchanges are needed. They can be computed from the
leading-log-Reggeon and the BFKL-Pomeron amplitudes. In applications, we argue
that the dependence of the energy-growth exponent on virtuality $Q^2$ for

first sign of a slowdown of energy growth towards satisfying the Froissart
bound. An attempt to understand these exponents with the present formalism is

are studied experimentally and theoretically. Experiments are performed on an
identified neuron in the visual system of the blowfly. It is shown that the
spike trains exhibit universal behavior over short time, modulated by a
stimulus-dependent envelope over long time. A model of the neuron as a
nonlinear oscillator driven by noise and an external stimulus, is suggested to
account for these results. The model enables a theoretic distinction of the
effects of internal neuronal properties from effects of external stimulus
properties, and their identification in the measured spike trains. The
universal regime is characterized by one dimensionless parameter, representing
the internal degree of irregularity, which is determined both by the
sensitivity of the neuron and by the properties of the noise. The envelope is
related in a simple way to properties of the input stimulus as seen through
nonlinearity of the neural response. Explicit formulas are derived for
different statistical properties in both the universal and the
stimulus-dependent regimes. These formulas are in very good agreement with the
data in both regimes.
