neutrino and antineutrino channels could enable the production of the rapid
neutron capture (r-process) nuclei in neutrino-heated supernova ejecta. In this
scheme the lightest sterile neutrino would be heavier than the electron
neutrino and split from it by a vacuum mass-squared difference roughly between
3 and 70 eV$^2$ and vacuum mixing angle given by $\sin^2 2\theta_{es} >
10^{-4}$.

Lyman-break technique represent, in number density, a major fraction of the
galaxies known in the Local Universe. Thus, understanding the properties and
the nature of these high-redshift systems is instrumental to our understanding
of the cosmic evolution of galaxies and their stellar content. I briefly review
the observed characteristics of the Lyman-break galaxies, relate these galaxies
to their most likely low-redshift counterparts, and discuss the implications of
dust obscuration on the global properties of the Lyman-break population.
Finally, the observational properties of the high-redshift population are set
in the framework of a simple evolutionary model for the stellar, metal and dust
content of galaxies, to derive the intrinsic star formation history of the
Universe.

V$, where $V=\rho, \omega, \phi$ or $J/\psi$ can proceed through photon-Pomeron
and photon-meson interactions. Photons from the electromagnetic field of one
nucleus interact coherently with the other nucleus. Photonuclear cross sections
are scaled from $\gamma p$ data, and convoluted with the photon spectrum to
find the exclusive rates.
  The cross sections at the RHIC and LHC heavy ion colliders are huge, 10% of
the total hadronic cross section at RHIC, and 50% at LHC. These accelerators
may be useful as vector meson factories. With iodine beams at RHIC, 640 $\rho$
are produced each second (10^{10}/year); with calcium at the LHC the rate is
240 kHz. The $\phi$ rates are 39 Hz at RHIC and 15 kHz at LHC, while the
$J/\psi$ rate is 0.3 Hz at RHIC and 780 Hz at the LHC.
  Because of the coherent couplings, the reactions kinematics are similar to
coherent two-photon interactions; we discuss the interplay between the two
reactions.

states n n and s s, respectively, of a single scalar nonet, it is pointed out
that the mass value of the iso-singlet flavor-octet state, obtained from the
orthogonal transformation, satisfies, together with the kappa(900) and the
iso-triplet scalar a0(980)-particle, the Gell-Mann Okubo mass-formula.
Furthermore, it is argued that, by investigating their properties of masses and

realizes the linear representation of SU(3) chiral symmetry.

  Data","23 pages. See also http://www.math.nwu.edu/~ralph/",,,,"math.AT math.GR",,"  Let $G$ be a finite group. To every smooth $G$-action on a compact, connected
and oriented Riemann surface we can associate its data of singular orbits. The
set of such data becomes an Abelian group $B_G$ under the $G$-equivariant
connected sum. The map which sends $G$ to $B_G$ is functorial and carries many
features of the representation theory of finite groups. In this paper we will
give a complete computation of the group $B_G$ for any finite group $G$.
  There is a surjection from the $G$-equivariant cobordism group of surface
diffeomorphisms $\Omega_G$ to $B_G$. We will prove that the kernel of this
surjection is isomorphic to $H_2(G;Z)$. Thus $\Omega_G$ is an Abelian group
extension of $B_G$ by $H_2(G;Z)$.
  Finally we will prove that the group $B_G$ contains only elements of order
two if and only if every complex character of $G$ has values in $R$. This
property shows a strong relationship between the functor $B$ and the
representation theory of finite groups.

the spectral function. In the superfluid phase we introduce the anomalous
self-energy in the fermion propagators and in the T-matrix equation,
consistently with the strong coupling BCS equations. The equations for the
nucleon spectral function include both a contribution of condensed and
scattering pairs. The method is illustrated by numerical calculations. Above
$T_c$ pseudogap formation is visible in the spectral function and below $T_c$ a
superfluid gap also appears.

spins, the $K$ ``moving agents'', are subject to local and pair unitary
transformations controlled by their position with respect to a fixed ring of
$M$ ``environmental''-spins. We demonstrate that a ``flow of coherence''
results between the various subsystems. Despite entanglement between the agents
and between agent and environment, local (non-linear) invariants may persist,
which then show up as fascinating patterns in each agent's Bloch-sphere. Such
patterns disappear, though, if the agents are controlled by different rules.
Geometric aspects thus help to understand the interplay between entanglement
and decoherence.
