  matter","15 pages, 2 figures, submitted to ApJ Lett",,"10.1086/312016",,"astro-ph",,"  Observed spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and luminous X-ray binaries
in our Galaxy suggest that both hot (~10^9 K) and cold (~10^6 K) plasma
components exist close to the central accreting black hole. Hard X-ray
component of the spectra is usually explained by Compton upscattering of
optical/UV photons from optically thick cold plasma by hot electrons.
Observations also indicate that some of these objects are quite efficient in
converting gravitational energy of accretion matter into radiation. Existing
theoretical models have difficulties in explaining the two plasma components
and high intensity of hard X-rays. Most of the models assume that the hot
component emerges from the cold one due to some kind of instability, but no one
offers a satisfactory physical explanation for this. Here we propose a solution
to these difficulties that reverses what was imagined previously: in our model
the hot component forms first and afterward it cools down to form the cold
component. In our model, accretion flow has initially a small angular momentum,
and thus it has a quasi-spherical geometry at large radii. Close to the black
hole, the accreting matter is heated up in shocks that form due to the action
of the centrifugal force. The hot post-shock matter is very efficiently cooled
down by Comptonization of low energy photons and condensates into a thin and
cold accretion disk. The thin disk emits the low energy photons which cool the
hot component.

objects (YSOs) are accelerated by underlying stellar winds or highly collimated
jets, the actual mechanism of acceleration remains uncertain. The most favoured
model, at least for low and intermediate mass stars, is that the molecules are
accelerated at jet-driven bow shocks. Here we investigate, through high
resolution numerical simulations, the efficiency of this mechanism in
accelerating ambient molecular gas without causing dissociation. The efficiency
of the mechanism is found to be surprisingly low suggesting that more momentum
may be present in the underlying jet than previously thought. We also compare
the momentum transferring efficiencies of pulsed versus steady jets. We find
that pulsed jets, and the corresponding steady jet with the same average
velocity, transfer virtually the same momentum to the ambient gas. The
additional momentum ejected sideways from the jet beam in the case of the
pulsed jet only serves to accelerate post-shock jet gas which forms a, largely
atomic, sheath around the jet beam.
  For both the steady and pulsing jets, we find a power law relationship
between mass and velocity ($m(v) \propto v^{-\gamma}$) which is similar to what
is observed. We also find that increasing the molecular fraction in the jet
decreases $\gamma$ as one might expect. We reproduce the so-called Hubble law
for molecular outflows and show that it is almost certainly a local effect in
the presence of a bow shock.

mass-to-light ratios (M/L). Stellar population models from Vazdekis et al. were
used to transform from the measured parameters to mean ages, [Mg/H] and [Fe/H].
Comparison of the ages derived from the Mg2-Hbeta diagram to those derived from
the Mg2-M/L diagram gives an estimate of the variation in the fraction of dark
matter. The distributions of the derived mean ages and abundances show that
there are real variations in both the mean ages and in the abundances. We find
an intrinsic rms scatter of [Mg/H], [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] of 0.2 dex, and an
intrinsic rms scatter of the derived ages of 0.17 dex.
  The slopes of the scaling relations between the global parameters for the
galaxies (the Mg2-sigma relation, the <Fe>-sigma relation, the Hbeta-sigma
relation) are consistent with the relation we find between the ages, the
abundances and the velocity dispersions. The slope of the Fundamental Plane is
steeper than predicted from the variations in the ages and abundances. Because
of the correlation between the mean ages and the mean abundances, substantial
variations in the ages and the abundances are possible while maintaining a low
scatter of all the scaling relations.

investigate the evolution of giant sources, and test their consistency with the

between the degree of core prominence and total radio luminosity, and show that
the giant radio sources have similar core strengths to the smaller sources of
similar total luminosity. Hence their large sizes are unlikely to be due to
stronger nuclear activity. The degree of collinearity of the giant sources is
also similar to the sample of smaller sources. The luminosity-size diagram
shows that the giant sources are less luminous than our sample of smaller-sized
3CR sources, consistent with evolutionary scenarios where the giants have
evolved from the smaller sources losing energy as they expand to these large
dimensions. For the smaller sources, radiative losses due to synchrotron
radiation is more significant while for the giant sources the equipartition
magnetic fields are smaller and inverse Compton losses with the microwave
background radiation is the dominant process. The radio properties of the giant
radio galaxies and quasars are consistent with the unified scheme.

see an incident double-peaked profile and an observer with a low inclination
sees single-peak profiles. It is predicted that different mass concentrations
around the accretion disk formed by a dusty wind may lead to the disparate

made at different scales; the ``type-selection'' effect introduced by the fact
that different galaxy surveys select different populations which do not have

galaxy clustering with models for the evolution of clustering in some fixed
cosmologies. Correcting for the scale-dependence effect significantly reduces
the discrepancies amongst different measurements. We interpret the observed
clustering signal at high redshift as coming from objects which are highly
biased with respect to the underlying distribution of mass; this is not the
case for $z\simlt 2$ where measurements are compatible with the assumption of a
much lower biasing level which only shows a weak dependence on $z$. Finally we
propose a model-independent test that can be used to place a lower limit on the
density parameter $\Omega_0$.

discuss several generic models (a `standard' shock-in-jet model, a precessing

that the observed variability is due to a superposition of intrinsic and

$F^2(\alpha)$ on the $B_s \Rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ amplitude via D-meson
triangle loop, where $\alpha$ = $(p^2+M^2)/M^2$ is the off-shellness parameter
of the exchanged D-meson of mass M and 4-momentum $p_\mu$, and is a variables
of the (internal)loop integration. Unfortunately, the $F^2(\alpha)$ effect
decreases the loop amplitude by a factor of 30 w.r.t. the point hadron value,
resulting in a reduction of 3 orders of magnitude in long distance (hadronic)
contributions to the $B_s \Rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay rate, thus greatly
impairing the visibility of such modes. PACS: 11.10.St ; 12.38.Lg ; 13.20.Gd ;

solve the hierarchy problem provided the fundamental scale in the higher
dimensional theory is at a much lower scale than the Planck scale. In this

region determined by the new fundamental scale, which is in our case is
electro-weak scale. We further investigate whether it is possible to inflate
not only the 3 uncompactified dimensions but also the extra dimensions. We
require around 70 e-foldings to stabilize the size of two extra dimensions from
$M_{\rm EW}^{-1}$ to the required 1 mm size. This can be easily achieved during
inflation, but once inflation ends their evolution is governed by the dynamical
history of the universe in a similar way that of Brans-Dicke field in
generalized Einstein theories. We also show that we achieve the right level of
density contrast without invoking any specific potential. The density contrast
depends on the number of extra dimensions and upon the amplitude of the
potential.

non-perturbative or constructive aspects of the theory. The usual formalism for
the renormalization group in field theory or statistical mechanics is reviewed,
together with its limits. The constructive formalism is introduced step by
step. Taylor forest formulas allow to perform easily the cluster and Mayer
expansions which are needed for a single step of the renormalization group in
the case of Bosonic theories. The iteration of this single step leads to
further difficulties whose solution is briefly sketched. The second part of the
course is devoted to Fermionic models. These models are easier to treat on the
constructive level, so they are very well suited to beginners in constructive
theory. It is shown how the Taylor forest formulas allow to reorganize
perturbation theory nicely in order to construct the Gross-Neveu2 model without
any need for cluster or Mayer expansions. Finally applications of this
technique to condensed matter and renormalization group around Fermi surface

within which the system frequency is rationally related to the forcing
frequency. We study extended oscillatory systems that respond to uniform
periodic forcing at one quarter of the forcing frequency (the 4:1 resonance).
These systems possess four coexisting stable states, corresponding to uniform
oscillations with successive phase shifts of $\pi/2$. Using an amplitude
equation approach near a Hopf bifurcation to uniform oscillations, we study
front solutions connecting different phase states. These solutions divide into
two groups: $\pi$-fronts separating states with a phase shift of $\pi$ and
$\pi/2$-fronts separating states with a phase shift of $\pi/2$. We find a new
type of front instability where a stationary $\pi$-front ``decomposes'' into a
pair of traveling $\pi/2$-fronts as the forcing strength is decreased. The
instability is degenerate for an amplitude equation with cubic nonlinearities.
At the instability point a continuous family of pair solutions exists,
consisting of $\pi/2$-fronts separated by distances ranging from zero to
infinity. Quintic nonlinearities lift the degeneracy at the instability point
but do not change the basic nature of the instability. We conjecture the
existence of similar instabilities in higher 2n:1 resonances (n=3,4,..) where
stationary $\pi$-fronts decompose into n traveling $\pi/n$-fronts. The
instabilities designate transitions from stationary two-phase patterns to
traveling 2n-phase patterns. As an example, we demonstrate with a numerical
solution the collapse of a four-phase spiral wave into a stationary two-phase
pattern as the forcing strength within the 4:1 resonance is increased.

"physics/9902044","Michael Byrne","Michael Byrne","The Cause of Gravity","Author believes that the statements are no longer valid",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  Einstein said that gravity is an acceleration like any other acceleration.
But gravity causes relativistic effects at non-relativistic speeds; so gravity
could have relativistic origins. And since the strong force is thought to cause
most of mass, and mass is proportional to gravity; the strong force is
therefore also proportional to gravity. The strong force could thus cause
relativistic increases of mass through the creation of virtual gluons; along
with a comparable contraction of space around nucleons; and then be diluted by
the relatively large volume of atoms. The strong force would thus indirectly
cause the spatial contraction known as gravity. And since gravity would thus
not be a true force, and there would then be no gravitons. And the electro-
weak and strong forces would therefore be the only two forces of nature. A
unifying equation was developed: E=(Ml+Mh/D)C^2; where E = the electroweak and
strong forces; Ml = lepton masses; Mh = hadron masses; and D = (1-V^2/C^2), as
a spatial contraction equaling 75.3982 fold. Einstein's formulas for excess
radius Re = GM/3C^2, and for gravity Gab = 8 G/C^2 Tab; both relate mass to
space curvature, and differ by 3x8 = 75.3982. And the same difference is found
between the observed proton mass, and the experimentally determined mass of a
proton's quark masses, at 12.5 MeV. So a revision of Einstein's equation for
gravity is Gab = GD/3C^2 Tab, where 8 = D/3 reveals the relativistic origins of
both 8 and of gravity. The early universe containing only energy, would
therefore have contained no matter; and so, would have contained little
gravity. And the inflationary period in the early universe would thus have been
due the lack of gravity before matter had formed.

simplifies. In particular the only relevant measure of the quality of the

mean quadratic error which is a new quantum version of the Cram\'er-Rao
inequality. This new bound expresses in a succinct way how in the quantum case
one can trade information about one parameter for information about another
parameter. The bound holds for arbitrary measurements on pure states, but only
for separable measurements on mixed states--a striking example of non-locality
without entanglement for mixed but not for pure states. Cram\'er-Rao bounds are
generally derived under the assumption that the estimator is unbiased. We also
prove that under additional regularity conditions our bound also holds for
biased estimators. Finally we prove that when the unknown states belong to a 2
dimensional Hilbert space our quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound can always be attained
and we provide an explicit measurement strategy that attains our bound. This
therefore provides a complete solution to the problem of estimating as
efficiently as possible the unknown state of a large ensemble of qubits in the
same pure state. For qubits in the same mixed state, this also provides an
optimal estimation strategy if one only considers separable measurements.
