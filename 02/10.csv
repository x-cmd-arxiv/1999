agents buying and selling a commodity. The Hamming distance between the
strategies used by agents to take decisions is introduced as an analytical tool
to determine several properties of these models. The success rate of the agents
in an adaptive version of the game is compared with the rate from a stochastic
version. It is shown numerically and analytically that the adaptive process is
inefficient, increasing the success rate of the unused strategies while
decreasing the success rate of the strategies used by the agents. The agents do
not do as well as if they were forced to use only one strategy permanently. A
version of the game in which the agents strategies evolve is also analyzed
using the notion of distance. The agents evolve into a state in which they are
all using one strategy, which is again the state that yields the maximum
success rate.

estimate, within the frame of the gravitational instability scenario, the
amount of vorticity generated after the first shell crossings in large-scale
caustics. In the Zel'dovich approximation the first emerging singularities form
sheet like structures. Here we compute the expectation profile of an initial
overdensity under the constraint that it goes through its first shell crossing
at the present time. We find that this profile corresponds to rather oblate
structures in Lagrangian space. Assuming the Zel'dovich approximation is still
adequate not only at the first stages of the evolution but also slightly after
the first shell crossing, we calculate the size and shape of those caustics and
their vorticity content as a function of time and for different cosmologies.
The average vorticity created in these caustics is small: of the order of one
(in units of the Hubble constant). To illustrate this point we compute the
contribution of such caustics to the probability distribution function of the
filtered vorticity at large scales. We find that this contribution that this
yields a negligible contribution at the 10 to 15 $h^{-1}$Mpc scales. It becomes
significant only at the scales of 3 to 4 $h^{-1}$Mpc, that is, slightly above

photometric structural parameters, including bulge fractions (B/T), from Hubble
Space Telescope images, and spectroscopic redshifts from the Keck Telescope.
The analysis includes a determination of the survey selection function in the
magnitude-size plane as a function of redshift, which mainly drops faint
galaxies at large distances. Our results suggest that selection effects play a
very important role. A first analysis treats disk-dominated galaxies with B/T <
0.5. If selection effects are ignored, the mean disk surface brightness
(averaged over all galaxies) increases by ~1.3 mag from z = 0.1 to 0.9.
However, most of this change is plausibly due to comparing low luminosity
galaxies in nearby redshift bins to high luminosity galaxies in distant bins.
If this effect is allowed for, no discernible evolution remains in the disk
surface brightness of bright (M_B < -19) disk-dominated galaxies. A second
analysis treats all galaxies by substituting half-light radius for disk scale
length, with similar conclusions. Indeed, at all redshifts, the bulk of
galaxies is consistent with the magnitude-size envelope of local galaxies,
i.e., with little or no evolution in surface brightness. In the two highest
redshift bins (z > 0.7), a handful of luminous, high surface brightness
galaxies appears that occupies a region of the magnitude-size plane rarely

Klein theory. In paper 1, we have solved the wind Euler equation, derived its
two eigenvalues, and addressed the solution topology and wind geometry. Here,
we focus on mass loss and velocity laws. We find that disk winds, even in
luminous novalike variables, have low optical depth, even in the strongest
driving lines. This suggests that thick-to-thin transitions in these lines
occur. For disks with a realistic radial temperature, the mass loss is
dominated by gas emanating from the inner decade in r. The total mass loss rate
associated with a luminosity 10 Lsun is 10^{-12} Msun/yr, or 10^{-4} of the
mass accretion rate. This is one order of magnitude below the lower limit
obtained from P Cygni lines, when the ionizing flux shortwards of the Lyman
edge is supressed. The difficulties with such small mass loss rates in CVs are
principal, and confirm our previous work. We conjecture that this issue may be
resolved by detailed nonLTE calculations of the line force within the context
of CV disk winds, and/or better accounting for the disk energy distribution and
wind ionization structure. We find that the wind velocity profile is well
approximated by the empirical law used in kinematical modeling. The
acceleration length scale is given by the footpoint radius of the wind
streamline in the disk. This suggests an upper limit of 10 Rwd to the
acceleration scale, which is smaller by factors of a few as compared to values

stars. Our main assumption is that wind helical streamlines lie on straight
cones. We find that the Euler equation for the disk wind has two eigenvalues,
the mass loss rate and the flow tilt angle with the disk. Both are calculated
self-consistently. The wind is characterized by two distinct regions, an outer
wind launched beyond four white dwarf radii from the rotation axis, and an
inner wind launched within this radius. The inner wind is very steep, up to 80
degrees with the disk plane, while the outer wind has a typical tilt of 60
degrees. In both cases the ray dispersion is small. We, therefore, confirm the
bi-conical geometry of disk winds as suggested by observations and kinematical
modeling. The wind collimation angle appears to be robust and depends only on
the disk temperature stratification. The flow critical points lie high above
the disk for the inner wind, but close to the disk photosphere for the outer
wind. Comparison with existing kinematical and dynamical models is provided.

cluster galaxy velocity dispersions seem to be accurately described by this
scaling with a normalization consistent with that predicted by the simulations

spatially resolved temperature profiles also follow a $T_x^{3/2}$ scaling
although with a normalization about 40% lower than that of the fit to the
virial masses. However, the isothermal $\beta$-model and x-ray surface
brightness deprojection masses follow a steeper $\propto T_x^{1.8-2.0}$
scaling. The steepness of the isothermal estimates is due to their implicitly

an aperture-mass estimator sensitive to gravitational tidal effects. The
signal-to-noise ratio of the latter allows to some degree to control the

reliable in terms of completeness and spurious detections. Choosing the

to 100%, and the fraction of spurious detections can significantly be reduced
compared to Abell-selected cluster samples.

superconductor in doped metallic regime. But the issue of superconducting
transition temperature is highly nontrivial, as the AF fluctuations in the form
of RVB pair-breaking are crucial in determining the phase coherence of the
superconductivity. Underestimated AF fluctuations in a fermionic RVB state are
the essential reason causing an overestimate of T_c in the same system. We
point out that by starting with a {\it bosonic} RVB description where both the
long-range and short-range AF correlations can be accurately described, the AF
fluctuations can effectively reduce T_c to a reasonable value through the phase
string effect, by controlling the phase coherence of the superconducting order

L to the power 1/2 where is the system size. This behaviour can be related to
the superdiffusive spreading of excess mass fluctuations on an infinite system.

of the general-relativistic description of gravitation, which emerges as a
consequence of the gravitationally induced phases of the so called
flavor-oscillation clocks, that the postulates of Quantum Theory are logically
incompatible with the usual Minimal Coupling Principle. It will be shown that
this inconsistency could emerge from the fact that the required geometrical
information to calculate the probability of finding a particle in any point of
the respective manifold does not lie in a region with finite volume.
Afterwards, we put forth a new Quantum Minimal Coupling Principle in terms of a
restricted path integral, and along the ideas of this model not only the
propagator of a free particle is calculated but we also deduce the conditions
under which we recover Feynman's case for a free particle. The effect on
diatomic interstellar molecules is also calculated. The already existing
relation between Restricted Path Integral Formalism and Decoherence Model will
enable us to connect the issue of a Quantum Minimal Coupling Principle with the
collapse of the wave function. From this last remark we will claim that the
geometrical structure of the involved manifold acts as, an always present,
measuring device on a quantum particle. In other words, in this proposal we
connect the issue of a Quantum Minimal Coupling Principle with a claim which

$V_Q\sim (3\times 10^{-3} {\rm eV})^4$ has been proposed as the origin of

in the framework of supergravity model including the quantum corrections
induced by generic (nonrenormalizable) couplings of $Q$ to the gauge and
charged matter multiplets. It is argued that the K\""ahler potential,
superpotential and gauge kinetic functions of the underlying supergravity model
are required to be invariant under the variation of $Q$ with an extremely fine
accuracy in order to provide a working quintessence potential. Applying these
results for string or $M$-theory, we point out that the heterotic $M$-theory or
Type I string axion can be a plausible candidate for quintessence if (i) it
does not couple to the instanton number of gauge interactions not weaker than
those of the standard model and (ii) the modulus partner ${\rm Re}(Z)$ of the
periodic quintessence axion ${\rm Im}(Z)\equiv {\rm Im}(Z)+1$ has a large VEV:
${\rm Re}(Z)\sim \frac{1}{2\pi}\ln(m_{3/2}^2 M_{Planck}^2/V_Q)$. It is stressed
that such a large ${\rm Re}(Z)$ gives the gauge unification scale at around the
phenomenologically favored value $3\times 10^{16}$ GeV. To provide an
accelerating universe, the quintessence axion should be at near the top of its
effective potential at present, which requires a severe fine tuning of the
initial condition of $Q$ and $\dot{Q}$ in the early universe. We discuss a late
time inflation scenario based on the modular and CP invariance of the moduli
effective potential, yielding the required initial condition in a natural
manner if the K\""ahler metric of the quintessence axion superfield receives a
sizable nonperturbative contribution.

framework of non-anomalous Abelian horizontal gauge symmetries with only three
light active neutrinos. We assume that the hierarchy in mass-squared splittings
is not accidental and that the small breaking parameters are not considerably
larger than 0.2. We find that the small angle MSW solution of the solar
neutrino problem can only be accommodated if the $\nu_\mu-\nu_\tau$ mass
hierarchy depends on the charges of at least three sterile neutrinos. The large
angle MSW solution can be accommodated in simpler models if $\nu_e$ and
$\nu_\mu$ form a pseudo-Dirac neutrino, but it is difficult to induce large
enough deviation from maximal mixing. The vacuum oscillation solution can be
accommodated rather simply. We conclude that it is possible to accommodate the
neutrino parameters in the framework of Abelian horizontal symmetries, but it
seems that these parameters by themselves will not provide convincing evidence
for this framework.

on the electron affinities of the first- and second-row atoms. The ab initio
study involves basis sets of $spdfgh$ and $spdfghi$ quality, extrapolations to
the 1-particle basis set limit, and a combination of the CCSD(T), CCSDT, and
full CI electron correlation methods. Scalar relativistic and spin-orbit
coupling effects were taken into account. On average, the best ab initio
results agree to better than 0.001 eV with the most recent experimental
results. Correcting for imperfections in the CCSD(T) method improves the mean
absolute error by an order of magnitude, while for accurate results on the
second-row atoms inclusion of relativistic corrections is essential. The latter
are significantly overestimated at the SCF level; for accurate spin-orbit
splitting constants of second-row atoms inclusion of (2s,2p) correlation is
essential. In the DFT calculations it is found that results for the 1st-row
atoms are very sensitive to the exchange functional, while those for second-row
atoms are rather more sensitive to the correlation functional. While the LYP
correlation functional works best for first-row atoms, its PW91 counterpart
appears to be preferable for second-row atoms. Among ``pure DFT'' (nonhybrid)
functionals, G96PW91 (Gill 1996 exchange combined with Perdew-Wang 1991
correlation) puts in the best overall performance. The best results overall are
obtained with the 1-parameter hybrid modified Perdew-Wang (mPW1) exchange
functionals of Adamo and Barone [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 108}, 664 (1998)], with
mPW1LYP yielding the best results for first-row, and mPW1PW91 for second-row
atoms. Indications exist that a hybrid of the type $a$ mPW1LYP + $(1-a)$
mPW1PW91 yields better results than either of the constituent functionals.

consider phase modulation detection, which we show has a different shot noise
level. We also take into account the effects of thermal damping of the mirror,
losses within the cavity, and classical laser noise. We relate our theoretical
results to experimental parameters, so as to make direct comparisons with
current experiments simple. We also show that in this situation, the standard
Brownian motion master equation is inadequate for describing the thermal
damping of the mirror, as it produces a spurious term in the steady-state phase
fluctuation spectrum. The corrected Brownian motion master equation [L. Diosi,

for quantum memory applications. For quantum computation, however, the
stability result does not extend beyond the first order. Thus, to perform
robust quantum computation in DF subspaces, they must be supplemented with

Boolean logic. We give a brief outline of its nonclassical aspects; in
particular violations of Boole-Bell type consistency constraints on joint
probabilities, as well as the Kochen-Specker theorem, demonstrating in a

bosonic environment [Physical Review {\bf A 58}, 1699, (1998)]. We establish a
systematic expansion in the ratio between the environmental correlation time
and the typical system time scale. The leading order recovers the Markov
theory, so here we concentrate on the next-order correction corresponding to
first-order non-Markovian master equations. These perturbative equations
greatly simplify the general non-Markovian QSD approach, and allow for
efficient numerical simulations beyond the Markov approximation. Furthermore,
we show that each perturbative scheme for QSD naturally gives rise to a
perturbative scheme for the master equation which we study in some detail.
Analytical and numerical examples are presented, including the quantum Brownian
motion model.
