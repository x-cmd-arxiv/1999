  1999",,"10.1086/300858",,"astro-ph",,"  Acquiring data for spectral classification of heavily reddened stars using
traditional criteria in the blue-violet region of the spectrum can be
prohibitively time consuming using small to medium sized telescopes. One such
star is the Vatican Observatory emission-line star VES 735, which we have found
excites the HII region KR140. In order to classify VES 735, we have constructed
an atlas of stellar spectra of O stars in the yellow-green (4800 - 5420 A). We
calibrate spectral type versus the line ratio HeI 4922:HeII 5411, showing that
this ratio should be useful for the classification of heavily reddened O stars
associated with HII regions.
  Application to VES 735 shows that the spectral type is O8.5. The absolute
magnitude suggests luminosity class V. Comparison of the rateof emission of
ionizing photons and the bolometric luminosity of VES 735, inferred from radio
and infrared measurements of the KR 140 region, to recent stellar models gives
consistent evidence for a main sequence star of mass 25 M_sun and age less than
a few million years with a covering factor 0.4 - 0.5 by the nebular material.
  Spectra taken in the red (6500 - 6700 A) show that the stellar H-alpha
emission is double-peaked about the systemic velocity and slightly variable.
H-beta is in absorption, so that the emission-line classification is ``(e)''.
However, unlike the case of the more well known O(e) star Zeta Oph, the
emission from VES 735 appears to be long-lived rather than episodic.

ZTRACE, is based on a self-consistent solution of the growing mode of

redshift-space density field, smoothed on some scale, ZTRACE finds via an
iterative procedure, an approximation to the initial density field for any

velocities are also reconstructed. The method is tested by applying it to
N-body simulations of an Einstein-de Sitter and an open cold dark matter
universe. It is shown that errors in the estimate of the density contrast
dominate the noise of the reconstruction. As a consequence, the reconstruction
of real space density and peculiar velocity fields using non-linear algorithms
is little improved over those based on linear theory. The use of a
mass-preserving adaptive smoothing, equivalent to a smoothing in Lagrangian
space, allows an unbiased (although noisy) reconstruction of initial
conditions, as long as the (linearly extrapolated) density contrast does not
exceed unity. The probability distribution function of the initial conditions
is recovered to high precision, even for Gaussian smoothing scales of ~ 5
Mpc/h, except for the tail at delta >~ 1. This result is insensitive to the

affected by compressional effects, when the thickness of the disk is taken into
account. The physical reason is that, in realistic self-gravitating disks, the
sound time through the disk is comparable with the rotation time; thus the
vertical hydrostatic equilibrium cannot be maintained adiabatically as the wave
propagates (an implicit hypothesis in the thin-disk approximation) and the disk
cannot move up and down solidly to follow the warp perturbation. There results,
together with the main vertical motion, a strong horizontal one which
significantly modifies the dispersion relation. We then turn to the case of a
disk composed of two fluids with different temperatures: this can correspond
either to the combined motions of the gas and the stars in a galactic disk, or
to their coupling with a flattened massive halo (assuming that, as for spiral
waves, stars are conveniently represented by a fluid if one stays away from
Lindblad resonances). We find, in addition to the usual warps, a
short-wavelength wave which might explain the ``corrugations'' observed in many
galactic disks. Finally, as a side result of this analysis, we discuss a
possible weak amplification of m>1 warps.

non-linear coupling between the spiral wave of the galaxy and two warp waves,
such that the former, which is linearly unstable and extracts energy and
angular momentum from the inner regions of the galactic disk, can continuously
feed the latter. We derive an expression for the coupling coefficient in the
WKB approximation. We show that the coupling is too weak in the stellar disk,
except at the Outer Lindblad Resonance where the spiral slows down and is
efficiently coupled to warp waves. There, the spiral can be almost completely
converted into ``transmitted'' warps, which we can observe in HI, and a
``reflected'' one, which we can observe as a corrugation. Our mechanism
reproduces the observed amplitudes of the warp and of the corrugation, and
might explain related phenomena such as the behavior of the line of nodes of
the warp. Furthermore we show that the energy and momentum fluxes of observed
spirals and warps are of the same order of magnitude, adding a strong point in

known that the debris forms a precessing stream, which may collide with itself.
The stream collision is a key process determining the subsequent evolution of
the stellar debris: if the orbital energy is efficiently dissipated, the debris
will eventually form a circular disk (or torus). In this paper, we have
numerically studied such stream collision resulting from the encounter between
a 10^6 Msun black hole and a 1 Msun normal star with a pericenter radius of 100
Rsun. A simple treatment for radiative cooling has been adopted for both
optically thick and thin regions. We have found that approximately 10 to 15% of
the initial kinetic energy of the streams is converted into thermal energy
during the collision. The angular momentum of the incoming stream is increased
by a factor of 2 to 3, and such increase, together with the decrease in kinetic
energy, significantly helps the circularization process. Initial luminosity
burst due to the collision may reach as high as 10^41 erg/sec in 10^4 sec,
after which the luminosity increases again (but slowly this time) to a steady
value of a few 10^40 erg/sec in a few times of 10^5 sec. The radiation from the
system is expected to be close to Planckian with effective temperature of

The position in energy of the ``ankle'' in the CR energy spectrum is shown to
arise in a natural way. Moreover, an origin of lower energy CRs in the Galactic
halo naturally accounts for the high degree of isotropy of CRs around 100 TeV
from airshower observations, and the small galactocentric gradient of
low-energy CRs derived from gamma-ray observations.

Within dynamical mean-field theory the model maps onto an impurity model where
the host has to be determined self-consistently. This impurity model can be
derived from an Anderson-Hubbard model both by equating the low-energy
excitations of the impurity and by a canonical transformation. On the level of
dynamical mean-field theory this establishes the connection of the two lattice
models. The impurity model is studied numerically by an extension of the
non-crossing approximation to a two-orbital impurity. We find that with
decreasing temperature the conduction electrons first form quasiparticles
unaffected by the presence of the lattice of localized spins. Then, reducing
the temperature further, the particle-hole symmetric model turns into an
insulator. The quasiparticle peak in the one-particle spectral density splits
and a gap opens. The size of the gap increases when the correlations of the
conduction electrons become stronger. These findings are similar to the
behavior of the Anderson-Hubbard model within dynamical mean-field theory and
are obtained with much less numerical effort.

for coupled XXZ chains, one has to deal with a recently discovered chiral

for three (and more) legs one can choose different inequivalent types of

period is equal to the flux quantum $\Phi_{0}=2\pi\hbar c/q$ entering the

a concomitant finite value of superfluid weight D_{s} occur along with metallic
antiferromagnetism. We argue that the charge q in the associated flux quantum

related to D_{s} linearly, in accordance to the generic Kosterlitz-Thouless
type of transition in a two-dimensional system, signalling the coherence of the

of a multimode field with finite bandwith. We discuss criteria for
continuous-variable teleportation with various sets of input states and apply
them to the teleportation of broadband fields. We first consider as a set of
input fields (from which an independent state preparer draws the inputs to be
teleported) arbitrary pure Gaussian states with unknown coherent amplitude
(squeezed or coherent states). This set of input states, further restricted to
an alphabet of coherent states, was used in the experiment by Furusawa {\it et

optimizing the teleportation fidelity. In our broadband scheme, the excess
noise added through unit-gain teleportation due to the finite degree of the
squeezed-state entanglement is just twice the (entanglement) source's squeezing
spectrum for its ``quiet quadrature.'' The teleportation of one half of an
entangled state (two-mode squeezed vacuum state), i.e., ``entanglement
swapping,'' and its verification are optimized under a certain nonunit gain
condition. We will also give a broadband description of this
