the tip of the red giant branch, down to the white dwarf cooling sequence. We
have used the color-magnitude arrays to extract main sequence luminosity
functions (LFs) from the turnoff to about 0.13 solar masses. The LFs of M10 is
significantly steeper than that for the other two clusters. The difference
cannot be due to a difference in metallicity. A comparison with the LFs from
Piotto, Cool, and King (1997), shows a large spread in the LF slopes. This
spread is also present in the local mass functions (MFs) obtained from the
observed LFs using different theoretical mass--luminosity relations. The
dispersion in the MF slopes remains also after removing the mass segregation
effects by using multimass King-Michie models. The globular cluster MF slopes
are also flatter than the MF slope of the field stars and of the Galactic
clusters in the same mass interval. We interpret the MF slope dispersion and
the MF flatness as an evidence of dynamical evolution which makes the present
day globular cluster stellar MFs different from the intial MFs. The slopes of
the present day MFs exclude that the low mass star can be dynamically relevant
for the Galactic globular clusters.

neutral hydrogen (HI) in the intervening intergalactic medium. However, the
Lyman-alpha line photons emitted by these sources are not eliminated but rather
scatter until they redshift out of resonance and escape due to the Hubble
expansion of the surrounding intergalactic HI. We calculate the resulting
brightness distribution and the spectral shape of the diffuse Lyman-alpha line
emission around high redshift sources, before the intergalactic medium was
reionized. Typically, the Lyman-alpha photons emitted by a source at z=10
scatter over a characteristic angular radius of order 15 arcseconds around the
source and compose a line which is broadened and redshifted by about a thousand
km/s relative to the source. The scattered photons are highly polarized.
Detection of the diffuse Lyman-alpha halos around high redshift sources would
provide a unique tool for probing the neutral intergalactic medium before the
epoch of reionization. On sufficiently large scales where the Hubble flow is
smooth and the gas is neutral, the Lyman-alpha brightness distribution can be
used to determine the cosmological mass densities of baryons and matter.

strong limits on the progenitors of radio pulsars and on the requirement of an

in type Ib and type Ic supernovae from interacting binaries (Iben & Tutukov
1996) breaks down on the implication that in that case either the formation
rate of binary pulsars (double neutron stars) should be of the order of 20%, of
the single pulsar birthrate or, alternatively, almost all single pulsars (85%
to 98%) should originate from Thorne-Zytkow stars. In the latter case the
pulsar velocity distribution is inconsistent with observations. Also, in that
case the difference between the supernova rate and the pulsar formation rate
would be about one order of magnitude, i.e.: much larger than observed.
  Allowing type II supernovae from single stars and non-interacting binaries to
form radio pulsars solves this conundrum, but then a kick is required in order
to explain the high velocities of single radio pulsars. A kick is also required
to understand the small birthrate, relative to the supernova rate, of binary

near-infrared images obtained with the Keck-I 10-m telescope. Both the HST and
Keck images show that the optical transient (OT) is clearly offset by 0.6
arcsec from an extended object, presumably the host galaxy. This galaxy is the
most likely source of the metallic-line absorption at z = 1.6004 seen in the
spectrum of the OT. With magnitudes V_{C} ~ 24.6 +/- 0.2 and K = 21.65 +/- 0.30
mag this corresponds to an L ~ 0.7 L_* galaxy, assuming that it is located at z
= 1.6. The estimated unobscured star formation rate is SFR ~ 6 M_sun/yr, which
is not unusually high for normal galaxies at comparable redshifts. The strength
of the observed metallic absorption lines is suggestive of a relatively high
metallicity of the gas, and thus of a chemically evolved system which may be
associated with a massive galaxy. It is also indicative of a high column
density of the gas, typical of damped Ly-alpha systems at high redshifts. We
conclude that this is the host galaxy of GRB 990123. No other obvious galaxies
are detected within the same projected radius from the OT. There is thus no
evidence for strong gravitational lensing magnification of this burst, and some
alternative explanation for its remarkable energetics may be required. The
observed offset of the OT from the center of its apparent host galaxy, 5.5 +/-
0.9 proper kpc (projected) in the galaxy's rest-frame, both refutes the
possibility that GRBs are related to galactic nuclear activity and supports
models of GRBs which involve the death and/or merger of massive stars. Further,
the HST image suggests an intimate connection of GRB 990123 and a star-forming
region.

astroparticle physics currently runs through an era of rapid progress and
moving frontiers. The non-vanishing neutrino mass establishes one smooth
component of dark matter which does not, however, supply a critical mass to the
Universe. Other dark matter particles are likely to be very massive and should
produce high-energy gamma rays, neutrinos, and protons in annihilations or
decays. The search for exotic relics with new gamma ray telescopes, extensive
air shower arrays, and underwater/-ice neutrino telescopes is a fascinating
challenge, but requires to understand the astrophysical background radiations
at high energies. Among the high-energy sources in the Universe, radio-loud
active galactic nuclei seem to be the most powerful accounting for at least a
sizable fraction of the extragalactic gamma ray flux. They could also supply
the bulk of the observed cosmic rays at ultrahigh energies and produce
interesting event rates in neutrino telescopes aiming at the kubic kilometer

neutrino beam can be used to search for tau lepton appearance thus allowing for
a proof of the neutrino oscillation hypothesis. Furthermore, a new method for
probing the era of star formation at high redshifts using gamma rays is

on a recently proposed model for their spectro-temporal properties. According
to this model, the observed light curves and aperiodic variability of BHC are
due to a series of soft photon injections at random (Poisson) intervals near
the compact object and their reprocessing into hard radiation in an extended
but non-uniform hot plasma corona surrounding the compact object. We argue that
the majority of the timing characteristics of these light curves are due to the
stochastic nature of the Comptonization process in the extended corona, whose
properties, most notably its radial density dependence, are imprinted in them.
We compute the corresponding Power Spectral Densities (PSD), autocorrelation
functions, time skewness of the light curves and time lags between the light
curves of the sources at different photon energies and compare our results to
observation. Our model light curves compare well with observations, providing
good fits to their overall morphology, as manifest by the autocorrelation and
skewness functions. The lags and PSDs of the model light curves are also in
good agreement with those observed (the model can even accommodate the presence
of QPOs). Finally, while most of the variability power resides at time scales
$\gsim$ a few seconds, at the same time, the model allows also for shots of a
few msec in duration, in accordance with observation. We suggest that
refinements of this type of model along with spectral and phase lag information
can be used to probe the structure of this class of high energy sources.

Wolf-Rayet galaxy NGC 5253. Our aim was to resolve the source of the soft
thermal X-ray emission seen by the ROSAT PSPC, proposed to be a luminous
superbubble by Martin & Kennicutt (1995). Instead of a single superbubble, we
find a complex of at least five sources of X-ray emission, associated with the
massive clusters of young stars at the centre of NGC 5253. The individual
0.1-2.4 keV X-ray luminosities of the components lie in the range 2-7 times
10^37 erg\s. Three of the components are statistically extended beyond the HRI
PSF, the largest having a FWHM of 8 (+10,-4) arcsec, equivalent to 160 (+200,
-80) pc. We consider the origin of the observed X-ray emission, concentrating
on the sources expected to be associated with the starburst region:
superbubbles, supernovae, supernova remnants and massive X-ray binaries. To
assess the X-ray luminosity of a young superbubble blown by a single massive
cluster of stars we perform hydrodynamical simulations with realistic
time-varying mass and energy injection rates. We conclude that the extended
X-ray components are most likely young superbubbles blown by individual young
clusters in the starburst region. We discuss in detail the implications of
multiple superbubbles on the efficiency of mass and metal ejection from dwarf
galaxies by starburst driven galactic winds. We suggest the presence of
multiple stellar clusters in starbursting dwarf galaxies and the resulting
multiple superbubbles will reduce the total ISM mass ejected from from dwarf
galaxies compared to the current models which only consider the blowout of a

transfer to the energy spectrum via Bogomolny's prescription. We verify our

vacuum determines the low-energy (infrared) properties of the fermionic energy
spectrum. Among them there is a class of the gapless systems which is
characterized by the Fermi-hypersurface, which is the topologically stable
singularity in momentum space. This class contains the conventional Landau
Fermi-liquid and also the non-Landau Luttinger Fermi-liquid. Another important
class of gapless systems is characterized by the topologically stable point
nodes (Fermi points). Superfluid 3He-A and electroweak vacuum belong to this
universality class. The fermionic quasiparticles (particles) in this class are
chiral: close to the Fermi points they are left-handed or right-handed massless
relativistic particles. Since the spectrum becomes relativistic at low energy,
the symmetry of the system is enhanced in the low-energy edge. The low-energy
dynamics acquires local invariance, Lorentz invariance and general covariance,
which become better and better when the energy decreases. Interaction of the
fermions near the Fermi point leads to collective bosonic modes, which look
like effective gauge and gravitational fields. Since the vacuum of superfluid
3He-A and electroweak vacuum are topologically similar, we can use 3He-A for
simulation of many phenomena in high energy physics, including axial anomaly.
3He-A textures induce a nontrivial effective metrics of the space, where the
free quasiparticles move along geodesics. Possible simulation in 3He-A of event

canonical method significantly improves the energy gaps for small systems and
weak coupling. The ``parity'' effect due to the number of electrons being even
or odd naturally emerges in our canonical results. Furthermore, we find a
``super-even'' effect: the energy gap oscillates as a function of even electron
number, depending on whether the number of electrons is $4 m$ or $4 m + 2$ (m
integer). Such oscillations as a function of electron number should be
observable with tunneling measurements in ultrasmall metallic grains.

us recover all previously known explicit solutions for the matrix eigenvalues.

interpreted in terms of the stationary points. In particular we show that a

it occurs at least cN times in most clusters of size n, for some constant c>0.
An analogous theorem for self-avoiding walks was proven in 1963 by Kesten. The
results also apply to weighted sums, and in particular we can take a$sub n$ to
be the probability that the percolation cluster containing the origin consists
of exactly n sites. Another consequence is strict inequality of connective
constants for sublattices and for certain subclasses of clusters.

An isotropic emission in its rest frame has been observed, indicating that an
equilibrated system has been formed. The excitation energy of the
Quasi-Projectile has been determined via calorimetry.
  A new event by event effective thermometer is proposed based on the energy
balance. A peak in the energy fluctuations is observed related to the heat
capacity, suggesting that the system undergoes a liquid-gas type phase
transition at an excitation energy about 5 A.MeV and a temperature 4 - 6 MeV,
dependent on the freeze-out hypothesis. By analyzing different regions of the
Campi-plot, the events associated with the liquid and gas phases as well as the
critical region are thermodynamically characterized.
  The critical exponents, tau, beta,gamma, extracted from the high moments of

  Beams","11 pages, 5 Postscript figures, to be published in Medical Physics",,"10.1118/1.598556",,"physics.med-ph",,"  We propose and analyze in detail a method to measure the in-air spatial
spread parameter of clinical electron beams. Measurements are performed at the
center of the beam and below the adjustable collimators sited in asymmetrical
configuration in order to avoid the distortions due to the presence of the
applicator. The main advantage of our procedure lies in the fact that the dose
profiles are fitted by means of a function which includes, additionally to the
Gaussian step usually considered, a background which takes care of the dose
produced by different mechanisms that the Gaussian model does not account for.
As a result, the spatial spread is obtained directly from the fitting procedure
and the accuracy permits a good determination of the angular spread. The way
the analysis is done is alternative to that followed by the usual methods based
on the evaluation of the penumbra width. Besides, the spatial spread found
shows the quadratic-cubic dependence with the distance to the source predicted
by the Fermi-Eyges theory. However, the corresponding values obtained for the
scattering power are differing from those quoted by ICRU nr. 35 by a factor ~2
or larger, what requires of a more detailed investigation.
