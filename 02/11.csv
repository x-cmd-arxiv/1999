galaxy 4C+55.16 at redshift 0.24. Extended soft X-ray emission is imaged by the
ROSAT HRI. The X-ray brightness profile is sharply peaked on the radio galaxy,
characteristic of a strong cooling flow. The X-ray spectrum obtained from ASCA
is consistent with multi-phase intracluster gas. There is evidence for an
absorbed cool component as well as ambient cluster medium in the ASCA spectrum.
A spectral fit, taking a cooling-flow component into account, gives a
temperature of kT=5.4(+1.4/-0.9) keV, metal abundance 0.5(+/-0.1)Zsun, excess
absorption on the cool component, nH=4.9(+3.4/-1.3)E+21 cm-2, and an
absorption-corrected bolometric luminosity of 2.2E+45 erg/s (H0=50km/s/Mpc,
q0=0.5). The mass deposition rate is estimated to be about 1100 Msun/yr from
the spectral analysis, in good agreement with that derived from imaging
analysis of the ROSAT data when corrected for absorption. We tentatively
identify a blue feature, seen about 15 arcsec from the centre of the radio
galaxy in a published optical image, as a gravitationally-lensed arc. The
inferred lensing mass is consistent with the gravitational mass derived from
the X-ray data. The best-estimate of the redshift of the lensed object is
1.5(>0.7). All the observed properties suggest that the environment of 4C+55.16
is similar to known massive cooling flow clusters. This is the first massive
cooling flow to be found around a powerful, radio source with a compact,

absorbing material internal to the narrow line region, rather than intrinsic

  The properties of the bars are best explained if the sample is divided into
early- (< SBbc) and late-type galaxies, and into active (starburst, Seyfert or
LINER) and normal galaxies. We find that galaxies with very long bars are
mostly active and that normal late-type galaxies have a distinct behavior from
the three other groups of galaxies. We confirm earlier findings that active
late-type galaxies tend to have both stronger and longer bars than normal ones.
An important result of this paper is that early-type galaxies do not share this
behavior : they all tend to have strong bars, whether they are active or not.
We also find correlations between bar strength and relative surface brightness
in the middle and at the edge of the bar, which are not followed by normal
late-type galaxies.
  These results are interpreted in the light of recent numerical simulations

galaxies represent the first stage of galaxy evolution, and that bars in early-

quantum spectra and semiclassical periodic orbit quantization. The method
allows to circumvent the uncertainty principle of the conventional Fourier
transform and to extract dynamical information from quantum spectra which has
been unattainable before, such as bifurcations of orbits, the uncovering of
hidden ghost orbits in complex phase space, and the direct observation of
symmetry breaking effects. The method also solves the fundamental convergence
problems in semiclassical periodic orbit theories - for both the Berry-Tabor
formula and Gutzwiller's trace formula - and can therefore be applied as a
novel technique for periodic orbit quantization, i.e., to calculate
semiclassical eigenenergies from a finite set of classical periodic orbits. The
advantage of periodic orbit quantization by harmonic inversion is the
universality and wide applicability of the method, which will be demonstrated
in this work for various open and bound systems with underlying regular,
chaotic, and even mixed classical dynamics. The efficiency of the method is
increased, i.e., the number of orbits required for periodic orbit quantization
is reduced, when the harmonic inversion technique is generalized to the
analysis of cross-correlated periodic orbit sums. The method provides not only
the eigenenergies and resonances of systems but also allows the semiclassical
calculation of diagonal matrix elements and, e.g., for atoms in external
fields, individual non-diagonal transition strengths. Furthermore, it is
possible to include higher order terms of the hbar expanded periodic orbit sum
to obtain semiclassical spectra beyond the Gutzwiller and Berry-Tabor
approximation.

fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter, associated with low
energies sliding motions of Bragg chains along the principal crystallographic
axes of the vortex lattice, lead to a weak first order 'melting' transition at
a certain temperature $T_{m}$, well below the mean field $T_{c\text{}}$, where
the shear modulus drops abruptly to a nonzero value. The residual shear modulus
above $T_{m}$ decreases asymptotically to zero with increasing temperature.
Despite the large phase fluctuations, the average positions of Bragg chains at
fimite temperature correspond to a regular vortex lattice, slightly distorted
with respect to the triangular Abrikosov lattice. It is also shown that a
genuine long range phase coherence exists only at zero temperature; however,
below the melting point the vortex state is very close to the triangular
Abrikosov lattice. A study of the size dependence of the structure factor at
finite temperature indicates the existence of quasi-long range order with
$S(\overrightarrow{G}) \sim N^{\sigma}$, and $1/2<\sigma <1$, where
superconducting crystallites of correlated Bragg chains grow only along pinning
chains. This finding may suggest a very efficient way of generating pinning
defects in quasi 2D superconductors. Our results for the melting temperature

quantum dissipation. The Wall formula for the calculation of friction in
nuclear physics and the Drude formula for the calculation of conductivity in
mesoscopic physics can be regarded as two special results of the general
formulation. We assume a time-dependent Hamiltonian $H(Q,P;x(t))$ with
$x(t)=Vt$, where $V$ is slow in a classical sense. The rate-of-change $V$ is
not necessarily slow in the quantum-mechanical sense. Dissipation means an
irreversible systematic growth of the (average) energy. It is associated with
the stochastic spreading of energy across levels. The latter can be
characterized by a transition probability kernel $P_t(n|m)$ where $n$ and $m$
are level indices. This kernel is the main object of the present study. In the
classical limit, due to the (assumed) chaotic nature of the dynamics, the
second moment of $P_t(n|m)$ exhibits a crossover from ballistic to diffusive
behavior. We define the $V$ regimes where either perturbation theory or
semiclassical considerations are applicable in order to establish this
crossover in the quantal case. In the limit $\hbar\to 0$ perturbation theory
does not apply but semiclassical considerations can be used in order to argue
that there is detailed correspondence, during the crossover time. In the
perturbative regime there is a lack of such correspondence. Namely, $P_t(n|m)$
is characterized by a perturbative core-tail structure that persists during the
crossover time. In spite of this lack of (detailed) correspondence there may be
still a restricted correspondence as far as the second-moment is concerned.
Such restricted correspondence is essential in order to establish the universal
fluctuation-dissipation relation.

the corresponding mathematics have to be genuinely discrete on the primordial

cellular networks and random graphs. One of our main themes is the development
of the concept of physical (proto)points as densely entangled subcomplexes of
the network and their respective web, establishing something like
(proto)causality. It max perhaps be said that certain parts of our programme
are realisations of some old and qualitative ideas of Menger and more recent
ones sketched by Smolin a couple of years ago. We briefly indicate how this

the symmetry of these coefficients has been assumed as a hypothesis in several

off-diagonal heat-kernel coefficients are impossibly difficult in nontrivial
cases and thus no case is known in the literature where the symmetry does not
hold. By approximating $C^\infty$ metrics with analytic metrics in common

charged Higgs bosons $H^\pm$ can be discovered at LHC over a vast region of the
parameter space previously thought unaccessible. If the charged Higgs bosons
are discovered in this decay mode and the measurements of its mass and
$\tan\beta$ are made, it allows us to make greater use of the dominant but QCD
background contaminated $bt$ decay mode by cuts suppressing phase space for the
background. In this paper we study the top quark polarisation in the $bt$ decay
mode. When $\tan\beta$ is either moderately large ($\tan\beta\gtrsim9$) or
small ($\tan\beta\lesssim4), the correlation effects can be used as a signal of
$H^\pm$ production. We outline the analysis procedure for various decay
signatures. As an example, we demonstrate the application of our procedure to
the dominant production process $gb\to tH^-$ at LHC. The effect is clearly
observable for $H^\pm$ mass between 200 GeV and 500 GeV in both leptonic and
hadronic channels, but at 500 GeV the boost on the top quark starts to prevent
the reconstruction of invariant masses, and hence the observation of the
correlation effect, in the hadronic decay channel.

this paper the one-loop correction of these bulk particles to the muon magnetic
moment (MMM) are investigated. In all the scenarios considered here it is found
that the natural value for the MMM is $O(10^{-8}-10^{-9})$. One main result is
that the contribution of each Kaluza$-$Klein graviton to the MMM is remarkably
finite. The bulk graviton loop implies a limit of $\sim 400$ GeV on the scale
of strong gravity. This could be pushed up to $\sim 1-2$ TeV, even in the case
of six extra dimensions, if the BNL E821 experiment reaches an expected
sensitivity of $\sim 10^{-9}$. Limits on a bulk $B-L$ gauge boson are
interesting, but still allow for forces $10^6-10^7$ times stronger than gravity
at mm$^{-1}$ distances. The correction of a bulk right-handed neutrino to the
MMM in one recent proposal for generating small Dirac neutrino masses is
considered in the context of a two Higgs doublet model, and is found to be
close to $10^{-9}$. The contributions of all these bulk particles to the MMM
are (roughly) independent of both the total number of extra dimensions and the
dimension of the subspace occupied by the bulk states. Finally, limits on the
size of ``small'' compact dimensions gotten from the MMM and atomic parity
violation are determined and compared.

proton-deuteron Drell-Yan processes. However, there exist only 22 finite ones
after integrating the cross section over the virtual-photon transverse momentum
\vec Q_T or after taking the limit Q_T->0. There are 11 new structure functions
in comparison with the ones of the proton-proton reactions, and they are
related to the tensor structure of the deuteron. Parton-model analyses indicate
an important tensor structure function V_T^{UQ_0}, which can be measured by a
quadrupole spin asymmetry. The Drell-Yan process has an advantage over lepton
reactions in finding tensor polarized antiquark distributions. We hope that our
studies will be realized in the next-generation RHIC-Spin project and other

symmetries the only possibly dangerous sources of flavor violation either come
from the corresponding ``bulk'' flavon (that is, flavor symmetry breaking

corresponding to G=SL(n).
  An interesting feature is the appearance of formal spectral curves, replacing
the projective spectral curves of the classical approach. The geometry of these
(usually singular) curves reflects the fine structure of loop groups, in
particular the detailed classification of their Cartan subgroups. To each such
curve corresponds a homogeneous space of the loop group and a soliton system.
Moreover the flows of the system have interpretations in terms of Jacobians of
formal curves.

much useful information, because the field can be directly related to the

incident nuclei, non-participating nucleons and charged fluid, the latter
consisting of strongly interacting hadrons or quarks. Parametrizing the
space-time evolution of the charged fluid based on hydrodynamic model, we study
the development of the electromagnetic field which accompanies the high-energy
heavy-ion collisions. We found that the incident nuclei bring a rather strong
electromagnetic field to the interaction region of hadrons or quarks over a few
fm after the collision. On the other hand, the observed charged hadrons'
spectra are mostly affected (Coulomb effect) by the field of the charged fluid.
We compare the result of our model with experimental data and found that the
model reproduces them well. The pion yield ratio pi^-/pi+ at a RHIC energy,
Au+Au 100+100 GeV/nucleon, is also predicted.

critical reflection of a weakly nonlinear, internal gravity wave from a sloping
boundary in a uniformly stratified fluid. Taking a distinguished limit in which
the amplitude of the incident wave, the dissipation, and the departure from
criticality are all small, we obtain a reduced description of the dynamics.
This simplification shows how either dissipation or transience heals the
singularity which is presented by the classical solution in the precisely
critical case. In the inviscid critical case, an explicit solution of the
initial value problem shows that the buoyancy perturbation and the along-slope
velocity both grow linearly with time, while the scale of the reflected
disturbance is reduced as $1/t$. During the course of this scale reduction, the
stratification is `overturned' and the Miles-Howard condition for stratified
shear flow stability is violated. However, for all slope angles, the
`overturning' occurs before the Miles-Howard stability condition is violated
and so we argue that the first instability is convective. Solutions of the
simplified dynamics resemble certain experimental visualizations of the
reflection process.

  Comments welcome, E-Mail: emqg@rogerswave.ca",,,,"physics.gen-ph",,"  The downward acceleration of the virtual electrically charged fermion
particles of the quantum vacuum is responsible for the Einstein Weak
Equivalence Principle and for our perception of 4D space-time curvature near
the earth. Since the virtual fermion particles of the quantum vacuum (virtual
electrons for example) possess mass, we assume that during their short
lifetimes the virtual fermions are in a state of downward acceleration (or
free-fall) near the earth. Many of the virtual fermions also possess electrical
charge, and are thus capable of interacting electrically with a real test mass,
since a test mass is composed of real, electrically charged, fermion particles.
The electrical interaction between the downward accelerated virtual fermions
with nearby light or matter is responsible for the equivalence of inertial and
gravitational mass, and also responsible for our perception of 4D space-time
curvature near the earth. In pure accelerated frames the apparent acceleration
of the virtual particles of the quantum vacuum is caused by the actual
accelerated motion of a test mass. An opposition to acceleration is felt by the
mass that is proportional to the magnitude of the mass, according to F=MA. This
process is responsible for inertia, and the exact reverse process is
responsible for the magnitude of the gravitational mass. This is why inertial
and gravitational mass are equal.

diluted with vanishing classical communication cost. Entanglement of bi-partite
pure states is thus established as a truly inter-convertible resource.
