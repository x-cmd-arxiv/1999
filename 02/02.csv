started early within the gamma-ray phase. The peak and power law decay of the
early optical emission strongly indicates the presence of a decelerating
relativistic shell during that phase. Prior to this burst, it was not known if
the shell decelerated during the burst, so an external shock origin for the
gamma rays was still possible. If the gamma-rays are produced in the external
shock, then the pulse widths should reflect the observed deceleration of the
shell and increase by about 2.3. We analyze the fine time structure observed in
the gamma-ray data from BATSE and determine that the width of the peaks do not
increase as expected for a decelerating shell; the later pulses are, at most, a
factor of 1.15 longer than the earlier pulses. We also analyze the variability
to determine what fraction of the shell's surface could be involved in the
production of the gamma rays, the so-called surface filling factor. For
GRB990123 we find a filling factor of 0.008. The lack of pulse width evolution
eliminates the only remaining kinematically acceptable external shock
explanation for the gamma-ray phase and, thus, the gamma rays must originate at
a central engine.

undergoing cyclical bursts of star formation, thereby determining the
luminosity function of these galaxies.
  When these bursting galaxies are added to normally evolving populations, the
combination reproduces the UV number counts, color distributions and deep
optical redshift distributions fairly well. Optical (including the Hubble Deep

function of very blue galaxies discovered by Landy et al. (1996) is also

  The number of bursting galaxies is only a small fraction of the total number
of galaxies at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, even at faintest

radio waves opacities (the ``GZK cut off'') might find a natural explanation if
the traveling primordial cosmic rays were UHE neutrinos (born by UHE photopion
decay) which are transparent to $\gamma$ or $\nu$ BBR. These UHE$% \nu$ might
scatter onto those (light and cosmological) relic neutrinos clustered around
our galactic halo.
  The branched chain reactions from a primordial nucleon (via photoproduction
of pions and decay to UHE neutrinos) toward the consequent beam dump scattering
on galactic relic neutrinos is at least three order of magnitude more efficient
than any known neutrino interactions with Earth atmosphere or direct nucleon
propagation. Therefore the rarest cosmic rays (as the 320 EeV event) might be
originated at far $(\tilde{>} 100 Mpc)$ distances (as Seyfert galaxy MCG
8-11-11). The needed UHE radiation power is in rough agreement with the NCG

and antineutrons as well as, at later stages, protons and antiprotons. These

age-metallicity relation derived from LMC clusters, test four IMF slopes, and
fit for the reddening, distance modulus, and star formation rate. We find that
we can just resolve structure in SFR(t) with time steps of ~0.15 in log age,
implying a resolution of ~4x10^8 years at an age of 1 Gyr. For a Salpeter IMF,
our derived star formation history for the NGC 1754 field is characterized by
an enhanced star formation rate over the past 4 Gyr, qualitatively resembling
that derived by others for a variety of LMC fields. The remaining four fields,
however, appear to have had high levels of star formation activity as long as
5-8 Gyr ago; these fields lie in the LMC Bar while the NGC 1754 field lies in
the disk, suggesting that the inner regions of the LMC contain significantly
more older stars than the outer regions. Examining the residuals of the models

disruptable orbits by two-body relaxation and tidal forces in non-spherical
galaxies. The highest disruption rates (one star per 10^4 yr) occur in faint
(L>10^10 L_sun) galaxies, which have steep central density cusps. More luminous
galaxies are less dense and have much longer relaxation times and more massive
BHs. Dwarf stars in such galaxies are swallowed whole by the BH and hence do
not emit flares; giant stars could produce flares as often as every 10^5 yr,
although the rate depends sensitively on the shape of the stellar distribution
function. We discuss the possibility of detecting disruption flares in current
supernova searches. The total mass of stars consumed over the lifetime of the

match an arbitrary set of observational constraints, without prior assumptions
about the phase-space distribution function (DF). Our method is an extension of
Schwarzschild's orbit superposition technique. As in Schwarzschild's original
implementation, we compute a representative library of orbits in a given
potential. We then project each orbit onto the space of observables, consisting
of position on the sky and line-of-sight velocity, while properly taking into
account seeing convolution and pixel binning. We find the combination of orbits
that produces a dynamical model that best fits the observed photometry and
kinematics of the galaxy. A key new element of this work is the ability to
predict and match to the data the full line-of-sight velocity profile shapes. A
dark component (such as a black hole and/or a dark halo) can easily be included
in the models.
  We have tested our method, by using it to reconstruct the properties of a

reproduced satisfactorily, either with the regular orbits, or with the
two-integral components. This paper mainly deals with the technical aspects of

{+0.4}_{-0.2} 10^{45}erg/sec) cluster of galaxies 3C 295. We fit both a
one-dimensional and a two-dimensional isothermal beta-model to the data, the
latter one taking into account the effects of the point spread function (PSF).
For the error analysis of the parameters of the two-dimensional model we
introduce a Monte-Carlo technique. Applying a substructure analysis, by
subtracting a cluster model from the data, we find no evidence for a merger,
but we see a decrement in emission South-East of the center of the cluster,
which might be due to absorption. We confirm previous results by Henry &
Henriksen(1986) that 3C 295 hosts a cooling flow. The equations for the simple
and idealized cooling flow analysis presented here are solely based on the
isothermal beta-model, which fits the data very well, including the center of
the cluster. We determine a cooling flow radius of 60-120kpc and mass accretion
rates of dot{M}=400-900 Msun/y, depending on the applied model and temperature
profile. We also investigate the effects of the ROSAT PSF on our estimate of
dot{M}, which tends to lead to a small overestimate of this quantity if not
taken into account. This increase of dot{M} (10-25%) can be explained by a
shallower gravitational potential inferred by the broader overall profile
caused by the PSF, which diminishes the efficiency of mass accretion. We also
determine the total mass of the cluster using the hydrostatic approach. At a
radius of 2.1 Mpc, we estimate the total mass of the cluster (M{tot}) to be
(9.2 +/- 2.7) 10^{14}Msun. For the gas to total mass ratio we get M{gas}/M{tot}
=0.17-0.31, in very good agreement with the results for other clusters of
galaxies, giving strong evidence for a low density universe.

oblivious setting (where all pre-planned queries are executed) there is no
savings: $n-1$ queries are required and are sufficient. In a nonoblivious

significant savings: in the synchronous case $0.586n$ queries suffice and
$0.536n$ queries are required; in the asynchronous case $0.896n$ queries
suffice and a fortiori 0.536 queries are required; for $o(\sqrt{n})$ \agents
using a deterministic protocol less than $n$ queries suffice; there is a simple

the goal of understanding the main physical mechanisms that determine transport
of chirality in scenarios of non-local electroweak baryogenesis. The focus is
on identifying the different transport coefficients for the different branches
of soft collective excitations of the fermion spectrum. These branches
correspond to collective excitations with opposite ratios of chirality to
helicity and different dispersion relations. By combining results from the hard
thermal loop (HTL) resummation program with a novel mechanism of fermion
damping through heavy scalar decay, we obtain a robust description of the
different damping rates and mean free paths for the soft collective excitations
to leading order in HTL and lowest order in the Yukawa coupling. The space-time
evolution of wave packets of collective excitations unambiguously reveals the
respective mean free paths. We find that whereas both the gauge and scalar
contribution to the damping rates are different for the different branches, the
difference of mean free paths for both branches is mainly determined by the
decay of the heavy scalar into a hard fermion and a soft collective excitation.
We argue that these mechanisms are robust and are therefore relevant for
non-local scenarios of baryogenesis either in the Standard Model or extensions
thereof.

The model also makes direct contact with squeezed light, and thus allows us to
describe these two completely different scenarios from a unified point of view.
  We obtain a fundamentally new result from our nonlocal QED, namely that only
the past, but not the future, can influence the present - thus establishing a
non-thermodynamic arrow of time at the quantum level. We also show that
correlations within a quantum system should necessarily be of the EPR-type, a
result that agrees with Bell's theorem. These results follow from the simple
requirement of energy conservation in matter-radiation interaction.
Furthermore, we also predict new and experimentally verifiable results on the
basis of our model QED.

three dimensions is studied without fixing a priori the functional form of V.
The second-order equations for the radial parts of the spinor wave function are
shown to involve a squared Dirac operator for the free case, whose essential
self-adjointness is proved by using the Weyl limit point-limit circle
criterion, and a `perturbation' resulting from the potential. One then finds
that a potential of Coulomb type in the Dirac equation leads to a potential
term in the above second-order equations which is not even infinitesimally
form-bounded with respect to the free operator. Moreover, the conditions
ensuring essential self-adjointness of the second-order operators in the
interacting case are changed with respect to the free case, i.e. they are
expressed by a majorization involving the parameter in the Coulomb potential
and the angular momentum quantum number. The same methods are applied to the
analysis of coupled eigenvalue equations when the anomalous magnetic moment of
the electron is not neglected.

solution to a Ginzburg-Landau perturbation of the defocusing nonlinear
Schroedinger equation (NLS), and to the nearly real complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation (CGL). By using dynamical systems techniques, it is shown that the
dark soliton can persist as either a regular perturbation or a singular
perturbation of that which exists for the NLS. When considering the stability
of the soliton, a major difficulty which must be overcome is that eigenvalues
may bifurcate out of the continuous spectrum, i.e., an edge bifurcation may
occur. Since the continuous spectrum for the NLS covers the imaginary axis, and
since for the CGL it touches the origin, such a bifurcation may lead to an
unstable wave. An additional important consideration is that an edge
bifurcation can happen even if there are no eigenvalues embedded in the
continuous spectrum. Building on and refining ideas first presented in Kapitula
and Sandstede (Physica D, 1998) and Kapitula (SIAM J. Math. Anal., 1999), we
show that when the wave persists as a regular perturbation, at most three
eigenvalues will bifurcate out of the continuous spectrum. Furthermore, we
precisely track these bifurcating eigenvalues, and thus are able to give
conditions for which the perturbed wave will be stable. For the NLS the results
are an improvement and refinement of previous work, while the results for the
CGL are new. The techniques presented are very general and are therefore
applicable to a much larger class of problems than those considered here.

information about the decohering system somewhere in the universe. The known
connection between decoherence of histories and the existence of records is
extended from the case of pure initial states to mixed states. Records may
still exist but are necessarily imperfect. We formulate an
information-theoretic conjecture about decoherence due to an environment: the
number of bits required to describe a set of decoherent histories is
approximately equal to the number of bits of information thrown away to the
environment in the coarse-graining process. This idea is verified in a simple
model consisting of a particle coupled to an environment that can store only
one bit of information. We explore the decoherence and information storage in
the quantum Brownian motion model. It is shown that the variables that the
environment naturally measures and stores information about are the Fourier
components of the function $x(t)$ (describing the particle trajectory). The
records storing the information about the Fourier modes are the positions and
momenta of the environmental oscillators at the final time. Decoherence is
possible even if there is only one oscillator in the environment. The
information count of the histories and records in the environment add up
according to our conjecture. These results give quantitative content to the
idea that decoherence is related to ``information lost''.
