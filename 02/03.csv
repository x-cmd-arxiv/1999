micron) spectral energy distribution (SED) of the central parsec of the M33
nucleus through new infrared photometry and optical/near-infrared spectroscopy,
combined with ultraviolet/optical observations from the literature and the HST

we model through a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code as a shell of clumpy
Milky Way-type dust (tau_V ~ 2 +/- 1). The discovery of Milky Way-type dust
(with a strong 2175 A bump) internal to the M33 nucleus is different from
previous work which has found SMC-like dust (no bump) near starburst regions.
The amount by which dust can be processed may be related to the mass and age of
the starburst as well as the extent to which the dust can shield itself. Our
starburst models include the effects of this dust and can fit the SED if the
nucleus was the site of a moderate (~10^8 L_sun at 10 Myrs) episode of coeval
star formation about 70 Myrs ago. This result is quite different from previous
studies which resorted to multiple stellar populations (between 2 and 7)
attenuated by either no or very little internal dust. The M33 nuclear starburst
is remarkably similar to an older version (70 Myr versus 10 Myr) of the
ultra-compact starburst in the center of the Milky Way.

that the central regions of the galaxy are heavily obscured by dust and that
the galaxy is most likely an interacting or disturbed system. We also present
new photometry of this object at 450, 850 and 1350 microns obtained using SCUBA

highly reddened stellar population with ongoing star formation, as originally
suggested by Graham & Dey (1996). The new sub-mm data presented here indicate
that the remarkable similarity to ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) such
as Arp220 extends into the rest-frame far-IR which bears the signature of
thermal emission from dust. ERO J164502+4626.4 is extremely luminous (7E12

stars, then ERO J164502+4626.4 is forming stars at the prodigious rate of
1000-2000 Msun/yr. We conclude that it is a distant analogue of the nearby

be missed by even the deepest existing optical surveys. The sub-mm emitters
recently discovered by deep SCUBA surveys may be galaxies similar to ERO

continuum magnitudes, we derive the column densities needed to suppress the
expected X-ray fluxes of our BALQSOs. In several cases we derive column
densities > 5x10^{23} cm^{-2} for a neutral absorber with solar abundances.
These are the largest X-ray column densities yet inferred for BALQSOs, and they
exceed ROSAT lower limits by about an order of magnitude. Optical brightness
does not appear to be a good predictor of 2-10 keV brightness for BALQSOs, but
our data do suggest that the BALQSOs with high optical continuum polarizations
may be the X-ray brighter members of the class. For example, the highly
polarized object PHL 5200 appears to be unusually X-ray bright for a BALQSO
given its optical magnitude. We discuss the implications of our results for

the dynamics of the first-order partially averaged system at resonance was
studied. Although in this manner, the finding that resonance lock occurs for
all initial relative positions of Jupiter and Saturn was confirmed, the
first-order partially averaged system at resonance did not provide a complete
picture of the evolutionary dynamics of the system and the similarity between
the dynamical behavior of the averaged system and the main planetary system
held only for short time intervals. To overcome these limitations, the method
of partial averaging near a resonance is extended to the second order of

system at resonance is presented. I show in this study that the dynamics of the
second-order partially averaged system at resonance resembles the dynamical

duration of the X-ray burst of SAX J1808.4 -- 3658 is proposed. An optical
companion of the neutron star (a ``turn-off'' Main - Sequence star) fills its
Roche lobe at the orbital period ($P_{orb}$) $\sim$ 19 hours. During the
initial high mass--transfer phase when the neutron star is a persistent X-ray
source, the neutron star is spun up to a millisecond period. Due to its
chemical composition gradient, the secondary does not become fully convective
when its mass decreases below 0.3 $\msun$, hence a magnetic braking remains an
effective mechanism to remove orbital angular momentum and the system evolves
with Roche - lobe overflow towards a short orbital period. Near an orbital
period of two hours the mass transfer rate becomes so small ($\sim$
$10^{-11}\msun$/yr) that the system can not continue to be observed as a
persistent X-ray source. During further Roche - lobe filling evolution deep
mixing allows the surface of secondary to become more and more helium rich.
Since the accreted matter is helium rich, it is easy to explain observed short
total duration of the burst . This evolutionary picture suggest that radio
emission can be observed only at shorter wavelength's. Our model predicts a
faster orbital period decay than expected if the orbital evolution is driven
only by gravitational wave radiation.

understanding the nature of their progenitors. Piro et al. (1999) and Yoshida
et al. (1999) report such a detection in the afterglow of GRB 970508 and GRB

the various scenarios proposed for the event progenitor. We show that the
observed line intensity requires a large iron mass, concentrated in the
vicinity of the burst. The previous explosion of a supernova, predicted in the
Supranova scenario, is the most straightforward way to account for such a large
amount of matter. We discuss three different physical processes that could
account for the line: recombination, reflection and thermal emission. Among
these, reflection and thermal emission may explain the observed line features:

seems to carry an essence of the nonperturbative QCD vacuum. Here we assume
that the multi-instanton system is characterized by the infrared suppression of
instantons as $f(\rho)\sim \rho^{-5}$ for large size $\rho$. We first
investigate a monopole-clustering appearing in the maximally abelian (MA) gauge
by considering the correspondence between instantons and monopoles. In order to
clarify the infrared monopole properties, we make the ``block-spin''
transformation for monopole currents. The feature of monopole trajectories
changes drastically with the instanton density. At a high instanton density,
there appears one very long and highly complicated monopole loop covering the
entire physical vacuum. Such a global network of long-monopole loops resembles
the lattice QCD result in the MA gauge. Second, we observe that the SU(2)
Wilson loop obeys an area law and the static quark potential is approximately
proportional to the distance $R$ between quark and anti-quark in the
multi-instanton system using the SU(2) lattice with a total volume of $V=(10
fm)^4$ and a lattice spacing of $a=0.05 fm$. We extract the string tension from
the $5 \times 10^{6}$ measurements of Wilson loops. With an instanton density
of $(N/V)=(1/fm)^4$ and a average instanton size of $\bar{\rho}=0.4 fm$, the
multi-instanton system provides the string tension of about $0.4 GeV/fm$.

too small. We conclude that, without additional physics beyond the MSSM, the

Gamma_{11}-cusp forms of weight 3. The same methods also provide an easy proof
of the rationality of A_{9}^{lev}.

QCD sum rule calculation. We study the Borel sum rule for the three point
function of one pseudoscalar one nucleon and one hyperon current up to order
six in the operator product expansion. The Borel transform is performed with
respect to the nucleon and hyperon momenta, which are taken to be equal. We
discuss and extend the result of a previous analysis in the
$\rlap{/}{q}i\gamma_5$ structure and compare it with the result obtained with
the use of the $\gamma_5 \sigma_{\mu \nu}$ structure. We find that the effect
of pole-continuum transitions is very important in the $\rlap{/}{q}i\gamma_5$
structure and that it changes completely results obtained in previous analysis.

existing BUU or QMD codes meets considerable difficulties. We propose a method
of replacing the scattering event by a tractable non-local scenario reproducing
the correct asymptotics. The first principle derivation justifies the use of
corresponding nonlocal kinetic equations. The nonlocal shifts are necessary if
the system should approach an equation of state with second quantum virial
coefficient. The modifications of QMD and BUU codes are discussed and
comparison are presented with resent data. We find a pre-equilibrium production
of particles leading to higher energetic distributions of protons.

in a miniaturized trap close to a solid surface. Two dominant heating
mechanisms are identified: proximity fields generated by thermally excited
currents in the absorbing solid and time-dependent image potentials due to
elastic surface distortions (Rayleigh phonons). Estimates for the lifetime of
the trap ground state are given. Ions are particularly sensitive to electric
proximity fields: for a silver substrate, we find a lifetime below one second
at distances closer than some ten micrometer to the surface. Neutral atoms may
approach the surface more closely: if they have a magnetic moment, a minimum
distance of one micrometer is estimated in tight traps, the heat being
transferred via magnetic proximity fields. For spinless atoms, heat is
transferred by inelastic scattering of virtual photons off surface phonons. The
corresponding lifetime, however, is estimated to be extremely long compared to
the timescale of typical experiments.
