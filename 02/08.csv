properties of their stellar populations. Evidence concerning the age of the
Galactic bulge stellar population is reviewed first, then the case of the bulge
of M31 is discussed. The similarity of bulges and ellipticals is then
illustrated, inferring that the problems of the origin of bulges and of the
origin of ellipticals may well be one and the same: i.e. the origin of galactic
spheroids. In this mood, the current evidence concerning the age of the bulk
stellar populations of early-type galaxies is then reviewed, both for low- as
well as high-redshift galaxies, and both for cluster as well as field
ellipticals. All reported evidence argues for the bulk of stars in galactic
spheroids having formed at high redshift, with only minor late additions and
small dependence on environment. In the final, more speculative Section an
attempt is made to evaluate how current formation scenarios can account for
this observational evidence. The role of spheroids in the cosmic star formation
and metal enrichment history is also briefly discussed. Finally, some critical
questions are asked, which answers may help our further understanding of the
formation and evolution of galactic spheroids.

different techniques to measure the amount and structure of the extinction
toward Taurus, and all four techniques agree very well. Thus we believe that
the AG results are a truthful representation of the extinction in the region
and can be used to test the reliability of the SFD reddening map. The results
of our test show that the SFD all-sky reddening map, which is based on data
from COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA, overestimates the reddening by a factor of 1.3
to 1.5 in regions of smooth extinction with A_V > 0.5 mag. In some regions of
steep extinction gradients the SFD map underestimates the reddening value,
probably due to its low spatial resolution. We expect that the astronomical
community will be using the SFD reddening map extensively. We offer this Letter
as a cautionary note about using the SFD map in regions of high extinction (A_V
> 0.5 mag), as it might not be giving accurate reddening values there.

3-12' from the center of the cluster and rises ~50% to 0.53 +- 0.04 solar
within the central 2'. The F-test shows that this abundance gradient is
significant at the >99.99% level. Nickel and sulfur abundances are also
centrally enhanced. We use a variety of elemental abundance ratios to assess
the relative contribution of SN Ia and SN II to the metal enrichment of the
intracluster gas. We find spatial gradients in several abundance ratios,
indicating that the fraction of iron from SN Ia increases toward the cluster
center, with SN Ia accounting for ~50% of the iron mass 3-12' from the center
and ~70% within 2'. The increased proportion of SN Ia ejecta at the center is
such that the central iron abundance enhancement can be attributed wholly to SN
Ia; we find no significant gradient in SN II ejecta. These spatial gradients in
the proportion of SN Ia/II ejecta imply that the dominant metal enrichment
mechanism near the center is different than in the outer parts of the cluster.
We show that the central abundance enhancement is unlikely to be due to ram
pressure stripping of gas from cluster galaxies, or to secularly accumulated
stellar mass loss within the central cD. We suggest that the additional SN Ia
ejecta near the center is the vestige of a secondary SN Ia-driven wind from the
cD (following a more energetic protogalactic SN II-driven wind phase), which
was partially smothered in the cD due to its location at the cluster center.

compactifications of type II theories of closed strings at weak coupling. We
find that the fundamental string scale, together with all compact dimensions,
can be at the TeV, while the smallness of the string coupling accounts for the
weakness of gravitational interactions. This is in contrast to the situation
recently studied in type I theories, where the string scale can be lowered only
at the expense of introducing large transverse dimensions felt by gravity only.
As a result, in these type II strings, there are no strong gravity effects at
the TeV, and the main experimental signature is the production of Kaluza-Klein
excitations with gauge interactions. In the context of type IIB theories, we
find a new possibility providing a first instance of large non-transverse
dimensions at weak coupling: two of the internal dimensions seen by gauge
interactions can be at the TeV, with the string scale and all other dimensions
at intermediate energies of the order of $10^{11}$ GeV, where gravity becomes
also strong. Finally, using duality, we provide a perturbative description for
the generic case of large dimensions in the heterotic string. In particular, we
show that the two type II theories above describe the cases of one and two
heterotic large dimensions. A new M-theory derivation of heterotic-type II
duality is instrumental for this discussion.

  Proceedings AIP R:CP461 of the workshop ""Misteries and Puzzles of Quantum
  mechanics"", Gargnano (ITALY)",,"10.1063/1.57868",,"quant-ph",,"  We propose a novel approach to intrinsic decoherence without adding new
assumptions to standard Quantum Mechanics. We generalize the Liouville equation
just by requiring the dynamical semigroup property of time evolution and
dropping the unitarity requirement. With no approximations and specific
statistical assumptions we find a generalized Liouville equation which depends
on two characteristic time t1 and t2 and reduces to the usual equation in the
limit t1 = t2 --> 0. However, for t1 and t2 arbitrarily small but finite, our
equation can be written as a finite difference equation which predicts state
reduction to the diagonal form in the energy representation. The rate of
decoherence becomes faster at the macroscopic limit as the energy scale of the
system increases. In our approach the evolution time appears, a posteriori, as
a statistical variable as if time evolution would take place randomly at
average intervals t2, each evolution having a time width t1. A generalized Tam
Mandelstam inequality is derived. The relation with previous work by Milburn is
discussed. The agreement with recent experiments on damped Rabi oscillations is
described.
