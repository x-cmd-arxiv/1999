Peebles and Vilenkin, leads to post-inflationary phases whose effective
equation of state is stiffer than radiation. The expected gravitational waves
logarithmic energy spectra are tilted towards high frequencies and
characterized by two parameters: the inflationary curvature scale at which the
transition to the stiff phase occurs and the number of (non conformally
coupled) scalar degrees of freedom whose decay into fermions triggers the onset
of a gravitational reheating of the Universe. Depending upon the parameters of
the model and upon the different inflationary dynamics (prior to the onset of
the stiff evolution) the relic gravitons energy density can be much more
sizeable than in standard inflationary models, for frequencies larger than 1
Hz. We estimate the required sensitivity for detection of the predicted
spectral amplitude and show that the allowed region of our parameter space
leads to a signal smaller (by one 1.5 orders of magnitude) than the advanced
LIGO sensitivity at a frequency of 0.1 KHz. The maximal signal, in our context,
is expected in the GHz region where the energy density of relic gravitons in
critical units (i.e. $h_0^2 \Omega_{GW}$) is of the order of $10^{-6}$, roughly
eight orders of magnitude larger than in ordinary inflationary models. Smaller
detectors (not necessarily interferometers) can be relevant for detection
purposes in the GHz frequency window. We suggest/speculate that future
measurements through microwave cavities can offer interesting perspectives.

calibration for all objects is available from surface brightness fluctuation

V_c and M_I, the TFR shows an intrinsic scatter, $\sim 0.7$ mag in M_I, or 0.15

the simple kinematics of disk galaxies, and the simple stellar populations of
early-type galaxies. Remarkably, in this sample of overall rotation-dominated
galaxies, the central stellar velocity dispersion is a better predictor of the
total I-band luminosity (through the Fundamental Plane relations) than the
circular speed at several exponential scale lengths. Furthermore, the TFR
zeropoint, or the mean stellar I-band luminosity at a given V_c, differs by
only $\sim 0.5$ mag between our sample of S0s and Mathewson et al.'s (1992)

well-sampled fold caustic crossing. In general, the surface of chi^2 shows
extremely complicated behavior over the 9-parameter space that characterizes
binary lenses. This makes it difficult to systematically search the space and
verify that a given local minimum is a global minimum. We show that for events
with well-monitored caustics, the caustic-crossing region can be isolated from
the rest of the light curve and easily fit to a 5-parameter function. Four of
these caustic-crossing parameters can then be used to constrain the search in
the larger 9-parameter space. This allows a systematic search for all solutions
and thus identification of all local minima. We illustrate this technique using
the PLANET data for MACHO 98-SMC-1, an excellent and publicly available
caustic-crossing data set. We show that a very broad range of parameter
combinations are compatible with the PLANET data set, demonstrating that
observations of binary-lens lightcurves with sampling of only one caustic
crossing do not yield unique solutions. The corollary to this is that the time
of the second caustic crossing cannot be reliably predicted on the basis of
early data including the first caustic crossing alone. We investigate the
requirements for determination of a unique solution and find that occasional
observations of the first caustic crossing may be sufficient to derive a
complete solution.

the standard generating functional of QCD in the path integral formalism. The
gluon-field integration is formally carried out by expressing the result in
terms of physical Green's functions of the gluon. To integrate over the
quark-field, we introduce a bilocal auxiliary field Phi(x,y) representing the
mesons. We then develop a consistent way of extracting the local pseudoscalar
degree of freedom U(x) in Phi(x,y) and integrating out the rest degrees of
freedom such that the complete pseudoscalar degree of freedom resides in U(x).
With certain techniques, we work out the explicit U(x)-dependence of the
effective action up to the p^4-terms in the momentum expansion, which leads to
the desired chiral Lagrangian in which all the coefficients contributed from
the normal part of the theory are expressed in terms of certain Green's
functions in QCD. Together with the existing QCD formulae for the anomaly
contributions, the present results leads to the complete QCD definition of the
coefficients in the chiral Lagrangian. The relation between the present QCD

holomorphic functions in which the K\""ahler potential transforms. The
arbitrariness of the U(1)-charges of matter multiplets is related to their
Weyl-weights in superconformal gravity, before it is reduced to supergravity.
The covariance of the K\""ahler potential forces the superpotential to be
covariant as well. This relates the cut-off, the Planck scale and the matter
charges to each other. A non-vanishing VEV of the covariant superpotential
breaks the K\""ahler U(1) spontaneously. If this VEV vanishes, the gravitino is
massless and depending on the above mentioned parameters there may be
additional internal symmetry breaking. The separation of the different
representations of chiral multiplets can be achieved by covariantizations of
derivatives and fermions. Using non-holomorphic transformations, the full

come out naturally. Various aspects are illustrated by applying them to

adsorbate layer with arbitrary coverage and the ensuing two-dimensional band
formation by metallic adsorbates in the monolayer regime. The coherent
potential approximation is employed to handle the randomness. The adsorbate
self-energy is evaluated explicitly using the density of states for the
substrate band. This takes us beyond the conventional wide-band approximation
and removes the logarithmic divergence associated with the binding energy
calculations. The formalism is applied to the electrosorption of copper ion on
gold electrode, and the coverage dependence of adsorbate charge, binding
energy, and adsorbate density of states are determined. The analysis predicts a
unique charge configuration of copper adsorbate, having a net positive charge,
in the high-coverage regime, and multiple charge states when the coverage is
low. Though one of the charge configurations of copper is nearly neutral at
small coverage, its positive charge state is the most stable in the entire
coverage range. The transition from the relative neutral state of copper at low
coverage to a positive charge configuration occurs sharply at the
intermediate-coverage region. This transition is caused due to the progressive
desolvation of copper adion with increasing coverage. The energy calculations
show that copper s-orbital bonding contributes maximally toward the binding
energy at the metal-vacuum interface, whereas it is the copper d-orbital
bonding which makes chemisorption feasible at the gold electrode. Finally, our
numerical results are compared with the relevant experimental studies.
