body microwave radiation field have led to the conclusion that the highest
energy cosmic rays, those observed at $\geq 10^{20}$ eV, must come from sources
within the present epoch. In light of this constraint, it is here suggested
that these particles may be accelerated near the event horizons of spinning
supermassive black holes associated with presently inactive quasar remnants.
The required emf is generated by the black hole induced rotation of externally
supplied magnetic field lines threading the horizon. Producing the observed
flux of the highest energy cosmic rays would constitute a negligible drain on
the black hole dynamo. Observations with upcoming air shower arrays and space
missions may lead to the identification of candidate dormant galaxies which
harbor such black holes. Although the highest energy events observed so far are
accounted for within the context of this scenario, a spectral upper bound at
$\sim 10^{21}$ eV is expected since the acceleration to higher energies appears
to be precluded, on general grounds.

solution for astrophysical accretion problems should be treated with some
caution because of their uncertain physical basis. The suggestions underlying
ADAF involve ignoring the magnetic field reconnection in heating of the plasma
flow, assuming electron heating due only to binary Coulomb collisions with
ions. Here, we analyze the physical processes in optically thin accretion flows
at low accretion rates including the influence of an equipartition turbulent
magnetic field. For these conditions there is continuous destruction of
magnetic flux by reconnection.
  The reconnection is expected to significantly heat the electrons which can
efficiently emit magnetobremstrahlung radiation. Because of this electron
emission, the radiative efficiency of the ADAF is not small. We suggest that
the small luminosities of nearby galactic black holes is due to outflows rather
than ADAF accretion.

within the beam. We compare these objects to an additional seven similar
sources we have found in the literature. The broad recombination line objects
(BRLOs) make up about 30% of all sources in complexes containing ultracompact
HII regions. Comparison of spectral line and continuum data implies that the
BRLOs coincide with sources with rising spectral indices, >=0.4 up to 100 GHz.
Both the number of BRLOs and their frequency of occurrence within HII region
complexes, when coupled with their small size and large internal motions, mean
that the apparent contradiction between the dynamical and population lifetimes
for BRLOs is even more severe than for ultracompact HII regions. We evaluate a
number of models for the origin of the broad recombination line emission. The
lifetime, morphology, and rising spectral index of the sources argue for photo-

Through an extensive estimation of the observational errors, we discuss whether
the distribution of the position angles (PAs) of polarization is simply
centrosymmetric or not. Taking into account the effect of a bad focus at the
time of the observation, we conclude that, within the accuracy of HST/FOC
polarimetry, the PA distribution is completely centrosymmetric. This means that
the UV polarization originates only from scattering of the radiation from a
central point-like source.
  However, our analysis shows that the most probable location of the nucleus is
only ~0.''08 (~6pc) south from the brightest cloud called ``cloud B''. The
error circle of 99% confidence level extends to cloud B and to ``cloud A''
which is about 0.''2 south of cloud B. By this FOC observation, Cloud B is only
marginally rejected as the nucleus.
  Assuming that the UV flux is dominated by electron-scattered light, we have
also derived a three-dimensional structure of the nuclear region. The inferred
distribution suggests a linear structure which could be related to the radio
jet.

hole with a toroidal electric current residing in a thin disk around the black
hole. The toroidal electric current generates a poloidal magnetic field
threading the black hole and disk. Due to the interaction of the magnetic field
with remote charged particles, the rotation of the black hole and disk induces
an electromotive force, which can power an astrophysical load at remote
distance. The power of the black hole and disk is calculated. It is found that,
for a wide range of parameters specifying the rotation of the black hole and
the distribution of the electric current in the disk, the power of the disk
exceeds the power of the black hole. The torque provided by the black hole and
disk is also calculated. The torque of the disk is comparable to the torque of
the black hole. As the disk loses its angular momentum, the mass of the disk
gradually drifts towards the black hole and gets accreted. Ultimately the power
comes from the gravitational binding energy between the disk and the black
hole, as in the standard theory of accretion disk, instead of the rotational
energy of the black hole. This suggests that the Blandford-Znajek mechanism may
be less efficient in extracting energy from a rotating black hole with a thin
disk. The limitations of our simple model and possible improvements deserved
for future work are also discussed.

that all these molecular species do not always exhibit the same sense of line
asymmetry and the correlation of velocity shift is better between HCN and CS
than between HCN and H2CO. The most opaque transition of HCN F=2-1 has about
the same velocity shift as that of CS despite of the larger beam size of this
study, which suggests that HCN F=2-1 line may be more sensitive to the internal
motion of YSOs than CS line. Systematic changes of the velocity shift are noted
for many sources, as one goes from F=0-1 to 2-1. The monotonic decrease of
velocity (blue shift) is apparently more frequent. A detailed model of
radiative transfer allowing line overlap of HCN is employed to L483 which shows
convincing signatures of infall on a scale of 0.1 pc. It appears that the

fitted with augmentations of density and infall velocity, by factors of 6 and

framework of a fully consistent chemical evolution model. 7Li production by AGB
stars and SNeII is discussed and the contribution by novae is reintroduced.
  To gain some insight into the stellar factories which should be taken into
account to reproduce the upper envelope of the observational A(Li) vs [Fe/H]
diagram for the solar neighborhood, we critically analyse Li data from several
authors. The contribution from nova outbursts seems to be fundamental in order
to reproduce the high 7Li abundances observed in the most metal-rich dwarfs.
Finally, we make predictions on the 7Li content that should be expected in the
most metal-rich stars of the Galactic bulge.

production yield on the largest scale so far. The ratio of the total iron mass

mass-to-light-ratio) is the same for all clusters which ICM is hotter than
$\sim 2$ keV, and the elemental proportions (i.e. the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio)
appear to be solar. From these evidences it is argued that both the IMF as well
the relative contributions of SN types are likely to be universal. Constraints
on the past SN activity in galaxy clusters are then derived, and support is
given to the notion that the average SNIa rate was much higher in the past,
i.e. at least 10 times more than currently observed in local ellopticals. It is
also argued that cluster metallicity ($\sim 1/3$ solar) should be taken as
representative of the low-z universe as a whole. There is now compelling
evidence that the bulk of stars in cluster as well as in field ellipticals and
bulges formed at high redshifts ($z\gsim 3$). Since such stars account for at
least $\sim 30%$ of the baryons now locked into stars, it is argued that at
least 30% of stars and metals formed before $z\simeq 3$. As a consequence, the
metallicity of the universe at z=3 is predicted to be $\sim 1/10$ solar. This
requires the cosmic star formation rate to run at least flat from $z\sim 1$ to
$\sim 5$, which appears to agree with the most recent derect determinations of
the star formation rate in Lyman-break galaxies.

to yield accurate results for liquid metals, to treat a partially ionized
plasma. In a plasma, the electrons change from a quantum to a classical fluid
gradually with increasing temperature; the QHNC method applied to the electron
gas is in fact able to provide the electron-electron correlation at arbitrary
temperature. As an illustrating example of this approach, we investigate how
liquid rubidium becomes a plasma by increasing the temperature from 0 to 30 eV
at a fixed normal ion-density $1.03 \times 10^{22}/cm^3$. The electron-ion
radial distribution function (RDF) in liquid Rb has distinct inner-core and
outer-core parts. Even at a temperature of 1 eV, this clear distinction remains
as a characteristic of a liquid metal. At a temperature of 3 eV, this
distinction disappears, and rubidium becomes a plasma with the ionization 1.21.
The temperature variations of bound levels in each ion and the average
ionization are calculated in Rb plasmas at the same time. Using the
density-functional theory, we also derive the Saha equation applicable even to
a high-density plasma at low temperatures. The QHNC method provides a procedure
to solve this Saha equation with ease by using a recursive formula; the charge
population of differently ionized species are obtained in Rb plasmas at several
temperatures. In this way, it is shown that, with the atomic number as the only
input, the QHNC method produces the average ionization, the electron-ion and
ion-ion RDF's, and the charge population which are consistent with the atomic
structure of each ion for a partially ionized plasma.

to recover that a chain with a symmetric distribution in
hydrophobic/hydrophilic components is localized at any temperature in the
thermodynamic limit, whereas a dissymmetric distribution in
hydrophobic/hydrophilic components leads to a delocalization phase transition.
It yields in addition explicit expressions for the thermodynamic quantities as
well as a very detailed description of the statistical properties of the
behaviors of the heteropolymers in the high temperature limit. For the case of
a small dissymmetry in hydrophobic/hydrophilic components, the renormalization
approach yields explicit predictions for the delocalization transition
temperature and for the critical behaviors of various quantities : in
particular, the free energy presents an essential singularity at the
transition, the typical length of blobs in the preferred solvent diverges with
an essential singularity, whereas the typical length of blobs in the other
solvent diverges algebraically. Finite-size properties are also characterized
in details for both cases. In particular, we give the probability distribution
of the delocalization temperature for the ensemble of chains of finite (large)
length $L$. Finally, we discuss the non-equilibrium dynamics at temperature $T$

explaining word meaning (a) by ostension and then (b) explaining it by means of
a vacuous symbol in a lexicon, often the word itself after typographic

correspond a simple entity that is its meaning. I then turn to the semantic
rules that Pustejovsky uses and argue first that, although they have novel
features, they are in a well-established Artificial Intelligence tradition of
explaining meaning by reference to structures that mention other structures
assigned to words that may occur in close proximity to the first. It is argued
that Fodor and Lepore's view that there cannot be such rules is without
foundation, and indeed systems using such rules have proved their practical
worth in computational systems. Their justification descends from line of
argument, whose high points were probably Wittgenstein and Quine that meaning
is not to be understood by simple links to the world, ostensive or otherwise,

unstable to the field rolling coherently to its true vacuum, we show that there
is an additional instability to wall formation if the scalar field does not
couple too strongly to gravity. Using the $\lambda \Phi^4$ and sine-Gordon

gravitating domain wall in detail numerically, following the solutions from
weak to strong gravity. We find excellent agreement with the analytic work.

subalgebra $g$ in the polynomial current Lie superalgebra $gl_{N|N}[u]$, has a
natural Lie co-superalgebra structure. Here we quantise the universal
enveloping algebra $U(g)$ as a co-Poisson Hopf superalgebra. For the quantised
algebra we give a description of the centre, and construct the double in the
sense of Drinfeld. We also construct a class of irreducible representations of
the quantised algebra, by introducing an appropriate analogue of the degenerate
affine Hecke algebra.

equivalent low energy potentials for heavy meson pairs, in which each meson
contains a heavy quark. This ""BB"" system is an attractive theoretical
laboratory for the study of the nuclear force between color singlets; the
hadronic system is relatively simple, and there are lattice gauge theory (LGT)
results for V_BB(r) which may be compared to phenomenological models. We find
that the quark model potential (after lattice smearing) has qualitative
similarities to the LGT potential in the two B*B* channels in which direct
comparison is possible, although there is evidence of a difference in length
scales. The quark model prediction of equal magnitude but opposite sign for I=0
and I=1 potentials also appears similar to LGT results at intermediate r. There
may however be a discrepancy between the LGT and quark model I=1 BB potentials.
A numerical study of the two-meson Schrodinger equations in the (bqbar)(bqbar)
and (cqbar)(cqbar) sectors with the quark model potentials finds a single
""molecule"", in the I=0 BB* sector. Binding in other channels might occur if the
quark model forces are augmented by pion exchange.

their compatibility with the available experimental data are discussed. In
particular we show that theoretical estimates, obtained in the framework of the
generalized nonextensive thermostatistics, can reproduce the shape of the pion
transverse mass spectrum and explain the different physical origin of the
transverse momentum correlation function of the pions emitted during the
central Pb+Pb and during the p+p collisions at 158 A GeV.

potential V(r) proportional to the inverse power of r of degree beta in an
arbitrary number of spatial dimensions. The presence of a single term in the
potential makes it impossible to use previous algorithms, which only work for
quasi-exactly-solvable problems. Nevertheless, the analysis of the stationary
Schrodinger equation in the neighbourhood of the origin and of the point at
infinity is found to provide relevant information about the desired solutions
for all values of the radial coordinate. The original eigenvalue equation is
mapped into a differential equation with milder singularities, and the role
played by the particular case beta=4 is elucidated. In general, whenever the
parameter beta is even and larger than 4, a recursive algorithm for the
evaluation of eigenfunctions is obtained. Eventually, in the particular case of
two spatial dimensions, the exact form of the ground-state wave function is
obtained for a potential containing a finite number of inverse powers of r,
with the associated energy eigenvalue.
