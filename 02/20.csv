of the large-scale lensing-convergence, or projected mass density, could be
used to constrain $\Omega_m$, the matter content of the universe. On the other
hand, deep weak-lensing field surveys in the near future will likely measure
the convergence on small angular scales (< 10 arcmin.), where the signal will
be dominated by highly nonlinear fluctuations. We develop a method to compute
the small-scale convergence skewness, using a prescription for the highly
nonlinear three-point function developed by Scoccimarro and Frieman (1998).
This method gives predictions that agree well with existing results from
ray-tracing N-body simulations, but is significantly faster, allowing the
exploration of a large number of models. We demonstrate that the small-scale
convergence skewness is insensitive to the shape and normalization of the
primordial (CDM-type) power spectrum, making it dependent almost entirely on
the cosmological energy contents, through their influence on the global
geometrical distances and fluctuation growth rate. Moreover, nonlinear
clustering appears to enhance the differences between predictions of the
convergence skewness for a range of models. Hence, in addition to constraining
$\Omega_m$, the small-scale convergence skewness from future deep several-
degree-wide surveys can be used to differentiate between curvature dominated
and cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) dominated models, as well as to constrain
the equation of state of a quintessence component, thereby distinguishing
$\Lambda$ from quintessence as well. Finally, our method can be easily
generalized to other measures such as aperture mass statistics.

  Oosterhoff Dichotomy","Latex file, 2 postscript files",,"10.1086/311981",,"astro-ph",,"  An examination of the period-V amplitude relation for RRab stars (fundamental
mode pulsators) with `normal' light curves in the Oosterhoff type I clusters M3
and M107 and in the Oosterhoff type II clusters M9 and M68 reveals that the V
amplitude for a given period is not a function of metal abundance. Rather, it
is a function of the Oosterhoff type. This result is confirmed by published
observations of RRab stars in M4, M5 and M92. A method devised by Jurcsik and
Kovacs has been used to determine whether the light curve of an RRab star is
`normal' or `peculiar'. Although M3 is considered to belong to the Oosterhoff
type I group, it has three bright RRab stars that seem to fit the
period-amplitude relation for Oosterhoff type II RRab stars. There is evidence
that these bright stars are in a more advanced evolutionary state than the
other RRab stars in M3, thus leading to the conclusion that the Oosterhoff
dichotomy is due to evolution. Our result gives support to the Lee, Demarque &
Zinn hypothesis that most RR Lyrae variables in Oosterhoff type I clusters are
ZAHB objects while those in the Oosterhoff type II clusters are more evolved.
This may have important implications for the derived ages of Oosterhoff type II
clusters. If their RR Lyrae variables have all evolved away from the ZAHB, then
their ages have been overestimated in studies that assume they are ZAHB
objects.

using the angular correlation function and the photometric redshift
distribution of galaxies brighter than I_{AB}\le 28.5 in the HDF North. The
reliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis of
the available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes and
investigating the effects of photometric errors. The redshift bins in which the
clustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account the
uncertainties of the photometric redshifts. The results show that the comoving
correlation length has a small decrease in the range 0<z<1 followed by an
increase at higher z. We compare these results with the theoretical predictions
of a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of CDM. The
comparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that the
observed high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with an
effective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. Assuming an Einstein-de
Sitter universe, we obtain b\simeq 2 at z=2 and b\simeq 5 at z=4. A comparison
of the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z=3 with those reported for
LBG suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: more
abundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm of
hierarchical galaxy formation. The strong clustering and high bias measured at
z=3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted for
the various cosmologies here considered. At z=4, the strong clustering observed
in the HDF requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be already
formed by that epoch. This feature could be a discriminant test for the
cosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.

the X-ray morphology of clusters: at the cluster core the EUV contours are
organized, but at larger radii they are anisotropic, and therefore need not
have originated from a hydrostatically stable medium. The ratio of EUV to soft
X-ray intensity rises with respect to cluster radius, to reach values ~10 times
higher than that expected from the virial gas. The strong EUV excess which
exists in the absence of soft X-ray excess poses formidable problems to the
non-thermal (inverse-Compton) scenario, but may readily be explained as due to
emission lines present only in the EUV range. In particular, warm gas produced
by shock heating could account for such lines without proliferation of
bolometric luminosities and mass budgets.

role. The remaining computational effort is mainly determined by the setup and
diagonalization of the Hamiltonian matrix. For the latter, two different
iterative schemes are compared. The speed-up gained by these optimizations is
compared to the runtime of the ``original'' version of the code, and the PPW

initial state approaching the flat, cold, empty, string perturbative vacuum.
The choice of such an initial state is suggested by the present state of our
Universe if we accept that the cosmological evolution is (at least partially)
duality-symmetric. Recently, the initial conditions of the pre-big bang
scenario have been criticized as they introduce large dimensionless parameters
allowing the Universe to be ""exponentially large from the very beginning"". We
agree that a set of initial parameters (such as the initial homogeneity scale,
the initial entropy) larger than those determined by the initial horizon scale,
H^{-1}, would be somewhat unnatural to start with. However, in the pre-big bang
scenario, the initial parameters are all bounded by the size of the initial
horizon. The basic question thus becomes: is a maximal homogeneity scale of
order H^{-1} necessarily unnatural if the initial curvature is small and,
consequently, H^{-1} is very large in Planck (or string) units? In the
impossibility of experimental information one could exclude ""a priori"", for
large horizons, the maximal homogeneity scale H^{-1} as a natural initial
condition. In the pre-big bang scenario, however, pre-Planckian initial
conditions are not necessarily washed out by inflation and are accessible (in
principle) to observational tests, so that their naturalness could be also
analyzed with a Bayesan approach, in terms of ""a posteriori"" probabilities.

approaches that of anti-de Sitter spacetime, we give a proof of topological
censorship applicable to spacetimes with such asymptotic behavior. Employing a
useful rephrasing of topological censorship as a property of homotopies of
arbitrary loops, we then explore the consequences of topological censorship for
horizon topology of black holes. We find that the genera of horizons are
controlled by the genus of the space at infinity. Our results make it clear
that there is no conflict between topological censorship and the non-spherical
horizon topologies of locally anti-de Sitter black holes. More specifically,
let D be the domain of outer communications of a boundary at infinity ``scri.''
We show that the principle of topological censorship (PTC), that every causal
curve in D having endpoints on scri can be deformed to scri, holds under
reasonable conditions for timelike scri, as it is known to do for a simply
connected null scri. We then show that the PTC implies that the fundamental
group of scri maps, via inclusion, onto the fundamental group of D, i.e., every
loop in D is homotopic to a loop in scri. We use this to determine the integral
homology of preferred spacelike hypersurfaces (Cauchy surfaces or analogues
thereof) in the domain of outer communications of any 4-dimensional spacetime
obeying PTC. From this, we establish that the sum of the genera of the
cross-sections in which such a hypersurface meets black hole horizons is
bounded above by the genus of the cut of infinity defined by the hypersurface.
Our results generalize familiar theorems valid for asymptotically flat
spacetimes requiring simple connectivity of the domain of outer communications
and spherical topology for stationary and slowly evolving black holes.

simulations. Parameter tuning is taken as an optimization problem in many
dimensions. The parameters are automatically adapted to reproduce known
experimental data such as the density and the heat of vaporization. Our method
is more systematic than guessing parameters and, at the same time saves human
labour in parameterization. It was successfully applied to several molecular
liquids: As a test, force fields for 2-methylpentane, tetrahydrofurane,
cyclohexene and cyclohexane were developed.

presented. It is based on the application of the Cauchy theorem for the
determination of the null space of the boundary overlap matrix. The method is
free from the limitations associated with the shape of the billiard and could
be applied even for nonconvex geometries where other algorithms face
difficulties. Moreover it does not suffer from the existence of eigenvalue
degeneracies which is another serious shortcoming of many methods. In the paper
we apply the algorithm to a few simple cases where the analytical solutions
exist. Numerical solutions have been investigated for the case of annular
billiard.

quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\""odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  This is the fifth closing part of our investigation. We briefly discuss the
observer's role in the theory and different realizations of the space-time
model used as a base space in the bundle approach to quantum mechanics. We
point the exact conditions for the equivalence of Hilbert bundle and Hilbert
space formulations of the theory. A comparison table between the both
description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is presented. We discuss some
principal moments of the Hilbert bundle description and show that it is more
general than the Hilbert space one. Different directions for further research
are pointed too.
