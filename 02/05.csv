heating of the intergalactic gas by the hard X-ray background (XRB), an effect

The rate of gain in thermal energy by Compton scattering will dominate over the

0.2x/<epsilon> times higher than the energy density of the UV background at a
given epoch, where x is the hydrogen neutral fraction in units of 1e-6 and

the redshift evolution of the extragalactic background radiation. The

simultaneous, multi-wavelength observations from 5--200 microns. With these
data we can study the behavior of the IR continuum in comparison with
expectations from competing thermal and non-thermal models. A key to
determining which mechanism dominates, is the measurement of the peak
wavelength of the emission and the shape of the far-IR--mm turnover. Turnovers
which are steeper than frequency^2.5 indicate thermal dust emission in the
far-IR.
  Preliminary results from our ISO data show broad, fairly smooth, IR continuum
emission with far-IR turnovers generally too steep to be explained by
non-thermal synchrotron emission. Assuming thermal emission throughout leads to
a wide inferred temperature range of 50-1000 K. The hotter material, often
called the AGN component, probably originates in dust close to and heated by
the central source, e.g. the ubiquitous molecular torus. The cooler emission is
too strong to be due purely to cool, host galaxy dust, and so indicates either
the presence of a starburst in addition to the AGN or AGN-heated dust covering
a wider range of temperatures than present in the standard, optically thick
torus models.

for mirror matter parameters that fit the neutrino observations, the maximum

NEW RESULTS for RR Lyraes in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the
so-called Short and Long Distance Scales may be reconciled whether a consistent
reddening scale is adopted for Cepheids and RR Lyrae variables in the LMC.
Distances and ages for the 9 clusters discussed in Paper I are re-derived using
an enlarged sample of local subdwarfs, which includes about 90% of the
metal-poor dwarfs with accurate parallaxes (Delta p/p < 0.12) in the whole
Hipparcos catalogue. On average, our revised distance moduli are decreased by
0.04 mag with respect to Paper I. The corresponding age of the GCs is
t=11.5+-2.6 Gyr (95% confidence range). The relation between Mv(ZAHB) and
metallicity for the nine programme clusters turns out to be
Mv(ZAHB)=(0.18+-0.09)([Fe/H]+1.5)+(0.53+-0.12).Thanks to Hipparcos the major
contribution to the total error budget associated with the subdwarf fitting
technique has been moved from parallaxes to photometric calibrations, reddening
and metallicity scale. This total uncertainty still amounts to about +-0.12
mag. Comparing the corresponding (true) LMC distance modulus 18.64+-0.12 mag
with other existing determinations, we conclude that at present the best
estimate for the distance of the LMC is: 18.54+-0.03+-0.06, suggesting that
distances from the subdwarf fitting method are 1 sigma too long. Consequently,
our best estimate for the age of the GCs is revised to: Age = 12.9+-2.9 Gyr

from four objects; in each case the emission is unresolved at 1"" resolution.
Fifteen radio galaxies remain undetected to sensitive limits of L'~15.5. Using
these data in tandem with archived HST data and near-IR spectroscopy we show
that 3 of the detected `radio galaxies' (3C22, 3C41, and 3C65) harbour quasars
reddened by Av<5. Correcting for this reddening 3C22 and 3C41 are very similar
to coeval 3C quasars, whilst 3C65 seems unusually underluminous. The fourth
radio galaxy detection (3C265) is a more highly obscured (Av~15) but otherwise
typical quasar which previously has been evident only in scattered light. We
determine the fraction of dust-reddened quasars at z~1 to be 28(+25)(-13)% at
90% confidence. On the assumption that the undetected radio galaxies harbour
quasars similar to those in 3C22, 3C41 and 3C265 (as seems reasonable given
their similar narrow emission line luminosities) we deduce extinctions of Av>15
towards their nuclei. The contributions of reddened quasar nuclei to the total
K-band light ranges from ~0 per cent for the non-detections, through ~10 per
cent for 3C265 to ~80 per cent for 3C22 and 3C41. Correcting for these effects
does not remove the previously reported differences between the K magnitudes of
3C and 6C radio galaxies, so contamination by reddened quasar nuclei is not a
serious problem for drawing cosmological conclusions from the K-z relation for
radio galaxies. We discuss these results in the context of the `receding torus'
model which predicts a small fraction of lightly-reddened quasars in samples of
high radio luminosity sources. We also examine the likely future importance of
thermal-IR imaging in the study of distant powerful radio sources.

Updated version of astro-ph/9803072",,,,"astro-ph",,"  Recent rapid advances in the observations of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) lend
much confidence to the cosmological fireball (FB) model: there is now
compelling evidence that the radiation is emitted by a relativistic shock where
a high speed upstream flow terminates. The question concerning what generates
such an outflow is central to our search for the ultimate trigger mechanism. A
key requirement, not well explained by current theories, is that the flow must
have high entropy-to-baryon ratio. In this Letter we point out that a quantum
discharge induced by the radiation of the initial FB may be the explanation.
The effect is likely to be relevant, because the FB energy density inferred
from GRB data is large enough that the radiation pressure leads to the
formation of a surface electric field which is unstable to pair creation. Under
suitable conditions, such as those of a supernova core, the discharge can
convert a substantial fraction of the FB energy into surface pairs. This pair
plasma is not contaminated by FB baryons because it is formed outside the FB.
We demonstrate that the pairs can then develop relativistic bulk expansion,
reaching a maximum speed that meets the constraints required to form a GRB.

no known analytical solutions and to study their nonuniqueness. The model that
was studied, the triaxial Dehnen potential, contains a central density cusp and
admits both regular and chaotic orbits. It was found that, for a weak density
cusp, self-consistent models do not exist if the chaotic orbits are assumed to
be completely mixed so as to yield a time-independent building-block: only the
innermost 65% of the mass can be mixed. In these inner regions, it is possible
to obtain alternative solutions that contain significantly different numbers of
chaotic orbits, yet yield (at least approximately) the same mass density
distribution. However, it is not clear whether these solutions are truly
time-independent, since the unmixed chaotic orbits in the outer regions, which
do not sample an invariant measure, can cause secular evolution. When using
Schwarzschild's method, one must be very careful to sample accessible phase
space as comprehensively and as densely as possible, while ensuring that each
orbit is a truly time-independent building block. Some of the numerical
equilibria were sampled to generate initial conditions for N-body simulations
to test the structural stability of the models. Preliminary work showed that no
catastrophic evolution takes place, but there is a weak tendency for the
configuration to become more nearly axisymmetric over several dynamical times.
It is not yet clear whether this tendency is real or a numerical artifact.

the manner in which ``sticky'' chaotic orbits that, in the absence of
perturbations, are confined near regular islands for very long times, can
become ``unstuck'' much more quickly when subjected to even very weak
perturbations. For both noise and periodic driving, the typical escape time
scales logarithmically with the amplitude of the perturbation. For white noise,
the details seem unimportant: Additive and multiplicative noise typically have
very similar effects, and the presence or absence of a friction related to the
noise by a Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem is also largely irrelevant. Allowing
for colored noise can significantly decrease the efficacy of the perturbation,
but only when the autocorrelation time becomes so large that there is little
power at frequencies comparable to the natural frequencies of the unperturbed
orbit. Similarly, periodic driving is relatively inefficient when the driving
frequency is not comparable to these natural frequencies. This suggests
strongly that noise-induced extrinsic diffusion, like modulational diffusion
associated with periodic driving, is a resonance phenomenon. The logarithmic
dependence of the escape time on amplitude reflects the fact that the time
required for perturbed and unperturbed orbits to diverge a given distance
scales logarithmically in the amplitude of the perturbation.

qualitatively, within the harmonic (``semiclassical'') theory, then,

that thermal fluctuations are responsible for a change of the buckling behavior

reducing the dynamics of the interacting octahedra to a one-dimensional

  Callender and Nick Huggett, Cambridge U. Press, Cambridge, 2001, pp. 177-195",,,"gr-qc hep-th math.CT math.QA",,"  This is a nontechnical introduction to recent work on quantum gravity using
ideas from higher-dimensional algebra. We argue that reconciling general
relativity with the Standard Model requires a `background-free quantum theory
with local degrees of freedom propagating causally'. We describe the insights
provided by work on topological quantum field theories such as quantum gravity
in 3-dimensional spacetime. These are background-free quantum theories lacking
local degrees of freedom, so they only display some of the features we seek.
However, they suggest a deep link between the concepts of `space' and `state',
and similarly those of `spacetime' and `process', which we argue is to be
expected in any background-free quantum theory. We sketch how
higher-dimensional algebra provides the mathematical tools to make this link
precise. Finally, we comment on attempts to formulate a theory of quantum
gravity in 4-dimensional spacetime using `spin networks' and `spin foams'.

no confining force in spite of the presence of a linearly rising term of the
potential. The large-N dynamics of quarks conforms well with Witten's
phenomenology. On the semiclassical level, hadrons are color neutral in the

the form of the Regge sequences related to infinite-dimensional unitary
representations of SL(4,R) which is shown to be the color gauge group of the

the unit square, let $T$ be the one with the smallest area, and let $A$ be the
area of $T$. Heilbronn's triangle problem asks for the maximum value assumed by
$A$ over all choices of $n$ points. We consider the average-case: If the $n$
points are chosen independently and at random (with a uniform distribution),
then there exist positive constants $c$ and $C$ such that $c/n^3 < \mu_n <
C/n^3$ for all large enough values of $n$, where $\mu_n$ is the expectation of
$A$. Moreover, $c/n^3 < A < C/n^3$, with probability close to one. Our proof
uses the incompressibility method based on Kolmogorov complexity; it actually
determines the area of the smallest triangle for an arrangement in ``general
position.''

$s$-pointed algebraic curves of genus $g$ can be determined from a polynomial
in $1/\gamma$ where $\gamma$ permits specialization, through $\gamma=1,$ to the
complex case treated by Harer and Zagier and, through $\gamma=1/2$, to the real
case. This polynomial appears to have geometric significance, and may be the
virtual Euler characteristic of some moduli space, as yet unidentified. This is
related to a conjecture that the indeterminate $b=\gamma^1-1$ is associated
with a combinatorial invariant of cell-decompositions through matrix models and
the Jack symmetric functions. The development uses Strebel differentials to
triangulate the moduli spaces, and the identification of $\gamma$ both as a
parameter in a Jack symmetric function and as a parameter in a matrix model
through generalized Selberg integrals.

(non-simplicial, in general) $d$-manifold in \rd naturally induces stresses of
lower dimensions on this manifold, and discuss implications of this
construction to the analysis of self-stresses in spatial frameworks. The
constructed mappings are not linear, but polynomial. In 1860-70s J. C. Maxwell
described an interesting relationship between self-stresses in planar
frameworks and vertical projections of polyhedral 2-surfaces. We offer a
partial analog of Maxwell correspondence for self-stresses in spatial
frameworks and vertical projections of 3-dimensional surfaces based on our
construction of polynomial mappings. Applying this theorem we derive a class of
three-dimensional spider webs similar to the family of two-dimensional spider
webs described by Maxwell. In addition, we conjecture an important property of
our mappings which is supported by a heuristic count based on the lower bound
theorem ($g_2(d+1)=dim\:Stress_2 \ge 0$) for $d$-pseudomanifolds generically
realized in ${\R}^{d+1}$ (Fogelsanger).

model. If we choose the z component of the isospin operator $t_{z}$, the above
operators are relevant to electromagnetic transitions; if we choose $t_{+}$
they are relevant to weak transitions such as neutrino capture. In going from
the spherical limit to the asymptotic (oblate) limit the strength for the
operator $\vec{s} t$ decreases steadily to zero; the strength for the operator
$\vec{\ell}\tau$ (scissors mode) increases by a factor of three. For the last
three operators - isovector dipole, spin dipole and orbital dipole (including
the twist mode) it is shown that the summed strength is independant of
deformation. The main difference in the behavior is that for the first two
operators we have in-shell transitions whereas for the last three operators the
transitions are out of shell.

the potential energy surface is a rather shallow function of the displacement
of the bubble from the center and in most cases the preferential position of a
bubble is off center. Systems with bubbles are expected to have bands of
extremely low lying collective states, corresponding to various bubble

orthodox quantum theory. When we insist upon ontological clarity---the
distinguishing characteristic of a Bohmian approach---these conceptual problems
vanish. We shall also discuss the implications of a Bohmian perspective for the
significance of the wave function, concluding with unbridled speculation as to
why the universe should be governed by laws so apparently bizarre as those of
quantum mechanics.

Schrodinger equation, which is responsible of the quantum effects of the
system, is then completely determined from the properties of the internal
motion, and its ``unusual'' properties have a simple and physical explanation
in the present context. From the impossibility to fix the initial conditions
relevant for the internal motion follows, finally, the need of a probabilistic
